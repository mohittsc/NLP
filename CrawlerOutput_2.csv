That makes this the largest marketed drug targeted to date by an FDA-approved biosimilar. Enbrel, which is sold by Amgen ($AMGN) was the fourth largest drug by worldwide sales last year.

But the Enbrel biosimilar, known as Erelzi (etanercept-szzs) as well as a Remicade biosimilar, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) from Pfizer ($PFE) and Celltrion that was approved earlier this year are being held up by patent disputes. So, an approval for these blockbuster biosimilars doesn t mean they will be on the market anytime soon.

Enbrel is still a growth driver for Amgen in fact, sales were up 10% year-over-year during the second quarter due to a combination of an increased net sales price and an improved competitive position.

The drug sold about $5.1 billion in the U.S. last year. It is Amgen s top selling drug. The newly approved biosimilar version is from Novartis  Sandoz division; it s also targeting Amgen s second largest drug by sales, Neulasta. But the FDA issued a complete response letter for that biosimilar candidate last quarter.

Sandoz has already launched Zarxio, a biosimilar of Amgen's Neupogen. This was the first biosimilar approved last year in the U.S. and the only, thus far, to be marketed in the country. Neupogen sales declined by almost one-quarter during the first half of the year compared to the same period a year prior to $256 million.

The unit is aiming for one of the broadest biosimilars portfolios in the industry; it s planning three more FDA submissions for biosimilars this year and next for Amgen s Epogen (epoetin alfa), AbbVie s Humira (adalimumab) and Roche s Rituxan (rituximab).

If Sandoz is successful that could put it in line to have biosimilars for 4 out of 8 of Amgen s top selling drugs. The company is aiming   to deliver one of the broadest biosimilars portfolios in the industry,  its Global Head of Drug Development and CMO Vasant Narasimhan said on the company's most recent earnings call.

As for Amgen, it s not just relying on lawyers to defend its sales. It s pursuing its own biosimilar strategy. It recently had a positive panel for a biosimilar version of Humira but AbbVie is making its own patent case in court to defend it.

In addition, Amgen has submitted to the FDA for a biosimilar version of two major Roche products: Avastin (bevacizumab) and Herceptin (trastuzumab).",Pharmaceuticals

The Cambridge, MA-based company is seeking a license for brigatinib, its investigational anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, to be used when patients cannot take or are resistant to Pfizer s ($PFE) marketed ALK non-small cell lung cancer drug Xalkori (crizotinib).

Ariad said in a statement that it is now seeking accelerated approval for brigatinib from the FDA after asking for its coveted priority review, which means it could be on the market around 3 to 4 months earlier than with a normal review. The U.S. regulator has already given the med its  Breakthrough  tag and allowed the rolling status.

 Many patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer eventually develop disease progression,  said Dr. Corey Langer, director of thoracic oncology in the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and a professor of hematology-oncology in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine.

 We are excited that the brigatinib NDA submission is now complete and are hopeful that brigatinib s data, including the observation of complete responses and activity in the central nervous system, will provide patients and their oncologists with a new treatment option. 

The NDA submission includes data from its Phase I/II and pivotal Phase II ALTA trials of brigatinib. In the ALTA trial, patients who suffered from disease progression on Xalkori were randomized to one of two brigatinib regimens.

With a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 54% of patients treated with 180 mg with a one-week lead-in at 90 mg achieved an investigator-assessed confirmed objective response--the trial s primary endpoint. In this arm, median progression-free survival was just over a year.

 With the completion of the brigatinib submission this week, we are excited by its potential, if approved, to offer additional hope to patients and their families,  stated Paris Panayiotopoulos, president and chief executive officer of Ariad.  We are thankful to the patients and physicians who participated in the clinical trials of brigatinib. We remain grateful to the FDA for granting brigatinib a breakthrough designation and the benefit of a rolling submission process, unique to the U.S. regulatory system. 

Ariad said it plans to submit brigatinib to the EMA in  early 2017.  Xalkori, which has several U.S. lung cancer licenses, made $488 million last year--up 11% on 2014.

The company hopes to have a better second half to 2016 after announcing back in March that it was axing about 90 staffers--25% of its total workforce--in an ongoing restructuring of the business.

The biotech said it was also reviewing its R&D portfolio and other aspects of the business. This did not however impact its work on brigatinib, which remains a primary focus. This also came after Ariad laid off around 40% of its staff in 2013 when it was forced to yank its leukemia drug off the market.",Pharmaceuticals

But while fostamatinib, its oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, hit its primary endpoint, only 18% of the 76 patients saw a stable platelet response, compared to none on the placebo arm. Analysts had previously believed low- to mid-20s was the likely target, although 18% still reaches statistical significance.

There were also a high number of AEs, with treatment-related AEs at 77% for the med, but just 28% on the placebo arm. GI complaints were the most observed adverse event on fostamatinib.

Shares had been trading up by 50% premarket this morning before the data were released at 7am ET--but then dropped by more than 9% within minutes of the figures being posted. This then rebounded to be up by around 40% by midday. The drug could reach peak annual sales of $300 to $400 million, according to estimates.

This is the first of two double-blind studies in the FIT Phase III programs for the treatment of adult chronic/persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Results from the second study are expected in October/November 2016.

The biotech is still trying to see this as a positive however, saying in a release that if these results are reproduced it will likely go for an NDA with the FDA in the first quarter of 2017.

""These data demonstrate the potential benefit of fostamatinib for chronic ITP patients who are in need of new treatment options,"" said Raul Rodriguez, president and chief executive officer of Rigel.

""We believe that fostamatinib has significant commercial potential given that it has a unique mechanism of action that may work where other products have failed.""

""We are very encouraged by these results,"" added Anne-Marie Duliege, executive vice president and chief medical officer of Rigel.

""Consistent with the prior clinical study of fostamatinib in ITP, this FIT Phase III study demonstrated that fostamatinib provided a robust and enduring benefit for those patients who responded to the drug candidate.""",Pharmaceuticals

Specifically, the San Diego, CA-based biotech said it has submitted the once-daily valbenazine to the FDA for tardive dyskinesia.

The company said it expects its submission to be accepted by October, giving it an expected PDUFA date in April, should it get an accelerated review--it has already received a ""breakthrough"" designation from the FDA.

Its drug is a VMAT2 inhibitor that modulates dopamine release during nerve communication. It is designed to treat tardive dyskinesia, a condition characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements of the face.

The biotech said that these symptoms are rarely reversible and there are currently no FDA-approved treatments.

Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note to clients that Neurocrine remained on an  outperform  rating as the NDA came a little earlier than expected.

The news gets better for Neurocrine, as partner AbbVie ($ABBV) is also on track to file their investigational endometriosis drug elagolix for its U.S. NDA next year.

 This is an important milestone in the development of valbenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, a serious disease for which there is no FDA approved pharmaceutical treatment,  said Kevin Gorman, president and CEO of Neurocrine Biosciences.

 We look forward to working with the FDA in their review of the valbenazine NDA submission to potentially bring this important treatment option to patients and physicians. 

But it s not always been good news for the biotech as back in June of last year it announced that it suspended two planned clinical studies of its CRF antagonist NBI-77860 out of  an abundance of caution. 

This came after the company said it had found  certain recent preclinical findings that we had not observed in previous animal studies. ",Pharmaceuticals

Vectura shares fell as much as 10% after it revealed the Phase III study missed its primary endpoint, quashing near-term hopes of expanding the use of a drug it acquired in the  441 million ($576 million) merger with Skyepharma.

Vectura s partner Mundipharma enrolled 1,767 patients in the study and randomized them to receive one of two doses of Flutiform or an active comparator, formoterol. After 52 weeks of daily dosing with the drugs, the study team analyzed the annual rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations in each arm. The key comparison was between the higher dose of Flutiform and the long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) formoterol. Mundipharma was hoping to see evidence Flutiform is better at controlling COPD exacerbations than formoterol.

In this regard, the experimental therapy fell short, resulting in the trial missing its primary endpoint. Mundipharma is now digging through the other endpoints, which compared the lower Flutiform dose to formoterol and looked at exacerbations, lung function and safety in each of the arms. But the failure to meet the primary endpoint has scuttled Mundipharma s plan to apply for approval in Europe on the strength of the Phase III data.

That news was seen by investors as serious enough to send shares in Vectura down 10% in early trading in London, although the stock rallied to make up some of the losses by midmorning. Faced with lengthening odds of LABA-inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combination Flutiform winning approval in COPD, Vectura CEO James Ward-Lilley sought to play up both the challenge of improving on standard of care and the potential to grow sales in other indications.

 COPD is a complex and highly variable disease and these trial results highlight the challenge in demonstrating reductions of exacerbations with ICS/LABA combinations in today s treatment environment,  Ward-Lilley said in a statement.  Whilst this result is disappointing, flutiform continues to grow strongly based on the approved asthma indication. 

Flutiform racked up sales of  92.4 million in the first 6 months of 2016, an increase of 42% over the comparable period of 2015. But, while there is still scope for Vectura to grow sales of Flutiform in its existing asthma indication, the potential loss of the COPD market nonetheless represents a blow to the company's plans to build its business and justify the merger with Skyepharma.

The failure of the addition of an ICS to a LABA to improve on the latter alone is in keeping with data from other COPD drug developers. GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) and Theravance Biopharma ($TBPH) encountered a similar setback during the development of Breo, but ultimately succeeded in winning approval for the once-daily ICS/LABA.",Pharmaceuticals

This is at least the third recent biotech reverse merger, coming amid the typical IPO doldrums of August.

Reverse mergers may be losing their stigma, especially considering recent high-profile success stories that started out that way and are now worth billions, such as Medivation ($MDVN) and Puma Biotechnology ($PUMA). Leap Therapeutics was formerly known as Dekkun and reported its first and only prior financing of almost $10 million in 2011.

The combined company will have $30 million, including an additional $10 million from Leap investors including HealthCare Ventures. That firm holds three seats on Leap s five-person board, including the company s CEO, Christopher Mirabelli, who is a HealthCare Ventures managing director.

""The combination with Macrocure positions our organization as a leading immuno-oncology company with sufficient capital to advance our pipeline of first-in-class monoclonal antibodies through significant value-creating events,"" said Mirabelli in a statement.

The resulting company will focus on the two early stage clinical cancer antibodies being developed at Leap: DKN-01, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) protein, and TRX518, a humanized GITR agonist monoclonal antibody designed to improve the immune system's antitumor response. The company will be focused on developing these two monoclonal antibody candidates going forward.

Continued Mirabelli, ""We anticipate achieving substantial clinical milestones over the course of 2016 and 2017. We plan to present data and initiate randomized studies for DKN-01, our lead development candidate, which has demonstrated clinical activity in esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma when combined with chemotherapy; and we expect to report data from a repeat-dose study of TRX518, a novel GITR agonist monoclonal antibody which is believed to enhance an immune anti-tumor response.""

Macrocure investors will hold about 31.8% of the resulting company, while Leap shareholders get about 68.2% of it. Macrocure will officially become a subsidiary of Leap; the executive team at Leap will retain all their positions in the Cambridge, MA-based company. The boards of both companies have agreed to the deal, which is expected to close around year end.

Wall Street drove up Macrocure shares on news of the deal by about 66%. Still, that only pushed the penny stock to a valuation of around $35 million, scarcely more than its cash that s slated at deal close.",Pharmaceuticals

CBT has closed the $9.75 million Series A financing (that includes $2 million in warrants), and with the proceeds, along with $5 million seed funding from its parent, the Californian biotech Crown Bioscience, sees the fledgling biotech s operating capital nudge up to $14.75 million.

The company is currently working on a pipeline of four candidates, with its two leading compounds being CBT-101 and CBT-501.

The former is an oral c-Met inhibitor designed to target the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway in certain cancers, while the latter is a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, which works by helping the body s immune system recognize and help kill tumors.

It s also got at the back of its pipeline a preclinical multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that is designed to go after uncontrolled growth signaling pathways and PD-L1 antibody.

CBT says it is  seeking partners for combination therapies  with its PD-1 and PDL-1 antibodies. This may include it going after big players such as Merck ($MRK), Bristol-Myers ($BMY) and Roche ($RHHBY), who all have approved PD-1/PD-L1 meds on the market, but have also set up a number of combo trials with other cancer drugs to try and boost efficacy.

Its board includes chair Guo-Liang Yu, also executive chairman of Crown Bioscience International and Jonathan Wang, senior M.D. and co-founder of OrbiMed Asia. The biotech s CEO and president is Sanjeev Redkar, who also founded the company this year.

 This financing allows us to advance two of our four development programs into human clinical trials,  said Redkar.

 CBT-101, a highly specific inhibitor of the c-MET receptor, has shown robust activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with a wide safety margin. CBT-101 is currently in a Phase I trial in China, and we plan to initiate a Phase I study in the United States in early 2017 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in cancer patients with c-MET dysregulated malignancies.

 We also plan to initiate a Phase 1 study of CBT-501, an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in south-east Asia in 2017. An Investigational Drug Application has been filed and CBT-501 is also awaiting the start of a Phase I trial in China. 

Its biggest backer, OrbiMed Asia--the Asian unit of OrbiMed--has offices in Shanghai and Mumbai and a kitty of more than $500 million under management.",Pharmaceuticals

But now he and his team, including co-founder Juan Jaen, are aiming for an even more ambitious goal--building a major immuno-oncology biopharma from the ground up with upstart Arcus Biosciences.

The Hayward, CA-based startup was founded in May 2015, shortly after the Flexus sale, and has raised a total of about $120 million in two financings already. The company had opted to remain in stealth mode thus far.

That s despite ample interest in the next efforts of this management team, which is comprised largely of Flexus execs--some of whom trace their roots back to Amgen, where Rosen was a longtime executive who finished his career there as VP of Therapeutic Discovery and South San Francisco site head.

An obvious expression of this group s confidence is that the first $30 million invested in Arcus came from its founders and other  friends and family  investors; The Column Group, Foresite Capital, Novartis ($NVS) and Celgene ($CELG) rounded out the Series A financing that dates back to May 2015 and totaled $49.7 million. The Column Group and Celgene were both also Flexus investors.

Arcus opted to raise another $70 million this August--despite having touched very little of the Series A cash. But by late last year, early research had proven promising enough to accelerate initial research--and financing--plans.

 In May, we strategically decided to get two of our projects into the clinic in 2017. At the outset, we had thought to advance just one in 2017 and the next in 2018,  Arcus CEO Rosen told FierceBiotech in an exclusive interview.  We still had $40 million left, but we wanted to expand what we were doing and push the other programs faster. 

That oversubscribed round was expanded from an initial $50 million to accommodate the addition of new investors including GV, which led, as well as Invus, Taiho Ventures, DROIA Oncology Ventures and Stanford University, which had the right to participate as part of a technology licensing deal. All the existing investors also participated.

The startup has scaled up its hiring, with an aim of 60 employees by year end, up from the previously planned 38. Arcus has set up shop in the East Bay, in a less expensive locale than San Francisco or Silicon Valley.

Beyond the general immuno-oncology frothiness, which Rosen expects will result in a lot of disappointing data in the next year or so because of poorly planned combination trials, Rosen and his team are committed to the big vision behind immuno-oncology.

 Immuno-oncology is a very unique, rare situation,  said Arcus  Rosen.  The body should be able to kill tumors, but the reality is that most things tried in the past haven t worked so well. 

He continued,  Recent trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 antibodies, have shown that if you can get the immune system to do what it s supposed to do, you can treat cancer. The academic community has been working away and sorting out the biology very aggressively.   We have decades of biological research that hasn t been translated into drug discovery. 

 This is something to double down on--we re going to bet big,  concluded Rosen as an explanation for why he s working to build Arcus as a long-term company.  This is the last field in which I will probably ever work. 

Arcus is working on small molecule and antibody I/O approaches with the aim of building its own internal combinations. Rosen likens the combo land-grab around I/O as likely to shape up along similar lines as the hepatitis C combo race--in which there were some major winners and losers on the path to assembling relevant combinations.

The company has selected its first three targets for small molecules along the ATP-adenosine pathway; CD73, CD39 and the A2A receptor. The idea is to use multiple means to discourage the extracellular enzymatic conversion of ATP, which is released by damaged or dying cells, into adenosine; the former encourages an immune response to cancer cells while the latter discourages it.

 Normally, ATP is released by cells as they die or are damaged,  explained Rosen.  It s a signal to the rest of the immune system to mount an inflammatory response. But ATP is converted to adenosine and by converting ATP to adenosine, not only is the signal to mount an immune response reduced, but adenosine also tells the immune system to stand down. 

Arcus plans to select a clinical candidate from its CD73 program, which is expected to be its lead, during the last quarter of this year. It, along with the A2A antagonist program, are both slated to reach the clinic next year.

The startup is also doing preclinical work on monoclonal antibodies, which they expect could result in backbone cancer therapies. They are specifically intended to complement the workings of the small molecules. Arcus is aiming not just for individual candidate activity, but for a combination effect with its own as well as external drugs. The company expects to have up to three of these antibodies in the clinic in 2018.

Arcus hasn t ruled out future deals to gain adjacent technology, such as cell-based therapies and gene editing, which could work well with its other approaches. It is going after three areas where it hopes to have best-in-class combinations: the elimination of active mechanisms of immune suppression, enhanced function of the APC (antigen presenting cells) as well as enhanced T cell, NK cell and macrophage effector activity.

Ultimately, Arcus is betting on a vision of personalized immuno-oncology treatment based on activity in a particular tumor.  Now, we are bucketing patients based on the organ of origin,  Arcus President Juan Jaen said.  What was the site of the origin of the tumor and what was the route of therapy? It s very, very crude. 

He continued,  We re moving toward more molecular or cellular analysis of what s going on in their particular tumor. That presents opportunities to further customize the agent or combination of agents. A couple of decades from now, the large majority of patients can be taken down a very specific path.

It was in fact this study that at the start of the year prompted the U.S. regulator to slap a full clinical hold on the biotech, halting dosing and persuading CTI to yank its newly completed drug application, given the high level of adverse events and deaths from the test.

The biotech had been given a fast-track status by the FDA in 2014, but the deaths in PERSIST-2 in pacritinib-treated patients, which included intracranial hemorrhage, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest, alarmed the FDA so greatly it said it could not allow its continuance.

The regulator recommended back in February that the biotech conduct dose exploration studies for pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis, and submit final study reports and datasets for its two studies PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2.

Today, it has posted some new data for the drug, which is partnered with Baxalta (now Shire) from PERSIST-2. This Phase III trial compared pacritinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, with other available therapies such as Novartis  ($NVS) Jakavi (ruxolitinib), for patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than 100,000 per microliter--a patient population with high-risk advanced disease.

Just over 300 patients were enrolled in the study, which formed the basis for the safety analysis, according to the biotech, but only 221 patients reached week 24 (the primary analysis time point) before the clinical hold was imposed.

CTI said that its preliminary results showed from these patients that the PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints, showing a statistically significant response rate in spleen volume reduction in patients with myelofibrosis treated with pacritinib compared to JAK2 inhibitor Jakavi.

But it did however fail to meet its other co-primary endpoint, of greater than 50% reduction in total symptom score.

The biotech said that the most common treatment emergent adverse events for pacritinib were  generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. 

The incidence of cardiac and bleeding adverse events (all grades and grade 3-4 including deaths) were similar across the arms, it added, with overall mortality rates  comparable between arms. 

Additional data from ongoing analyses along with top-line results from PERSIST-2 are slated to be posted at an upcoming scientific meeting.

 Having analyzed data from two Phase III trials with the only JAK inhibitor to be studied in severely thrombocytopenic patients, including patients on JAK2 therapy or those who failed prior JAK2, we are encouraged by pacritinib's clinical profile in this difficult-to-treat group of patients with myelofibrosis,  said James Bianco, president and CEO of CTI BioPharma.

 We are grateful for the support and commitment of the investigators, our steering committee and, most importantly, all the patients who participated in PERSIST-2.  Despite the upbeat tone, the clinical hold still remains on the biotech.

The biotech was marginally up 1.45% at the end of play Friday, before the data were posted, but is still locked in penny-stock territory with shares trading at 35 cents and with a market cap of just $100 million.",Pharmaceuticals

Seikagaku has advanced the drug into two Phase III trials designed to give it the data it needs to win approval in the U.S. Having initiated this process, Seikagaku will stay in charge throughout the Phase III trials and subsequent regulatory filing, before handing off to Ferring in the event it wins approval. Ferring will then commercialize the drug in the U.S., while also potentially running the trials needed to win approval in other markets.

The deal sees Ferring pay an undisclosed upfront fee, plus development and regulatory milestones and sales royalties. An earlier release to disclose a letter of intent between the companies put the size of the upfront at $5 million ( 4.5 million). In return, Ferring is gaining the rights to a drug it and some third parties think can provide another option to patients who suffer pain as the result of lumbar disc herniation, a degenerative process affecting intervertebral discs.

 Condoliase could offer a non-surgical alternative to patients for whom conservative therapy and/or corticosteroid injections have failed to provide durable relief, while maintaining the option for surgery should it later become medically necessary,  Dr. Ray Baker, a former president of the North American Spine Society, said in a statement.

Seikagaku has already tested condoliase, also known as SI-6603, in a Phase III trial in Japan. The 163-patient study found a single injection of condoliase was better than placebo at improving scores of worst leg pain. After 13 weeks, the leg pain scores of 72% of patients in the condoliase cohort improved by 50% or more compared with the baseline. Approximately half of patients in the placebo arm experienced similar improvements. Condoliase was also associated with improvements in physical function and quality of life scores.

Notably, while the treatment cohort featured a higher frequency of reports of back pain and other adverse events, Seikagaku saw the overall safety profile as supporting continued development of the drug. Condoliase works by chemonucleolysis, the process of using an enzyme to dissolve part of the disc. Another product with the same mechanism of action, Chymopapain, was subject to multiple lawsuits before being pulled from the U.S. market in 2003.

Ferring is now looking to enable physicians to once again offer chemonucleolysis and, in doing so, build out its portfolio of orthopedic treatments. The Swiss drugmaker has engaged in checkbook pipeline building over the past two years to expand its orthopedic range, adding Phase III assets through deals with BioSurface Engineering Technologies and now Seikagaku.",Pharmaceuticals

But questions, and the need for more clinical data, remain.

The San Diego, CA-based biotech has published new top-line data from the ESC Congress in Rome that used its allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells, delivered through an IV, to heart failure patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The biotech used a number of endpoints to assess efficacy, including a 6-minute walk test and the KCCQ Clinical Summary score, both of which hit statistical significance, although exact figures were not released.

There was however only a  trend to improvement  in KCCQ Functional Status score, with the data also showing the stem cell therapy can suppress inflammation, something the biotech stresses is  noteworthy because inflammation is believed to importantly contribute to [heart failure] HF progression.  There was in addition a statistically significant reduction in natural killer cells.

But overall, there was no difference in cardiac structure and function and the company had to dig deep with some  exploratory data analysis  to show that there was a statistically significant improvement in the left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes in the stem cell-treated groups--something it said that was not seen in the placebo-treated group.

The single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study gave the treatment to just 22 enrolled patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The test was set up to randomize patients, with both CardioCell's treatment and the placebo given intravenously. At 90 days after the first injection, the control group received CardioCell's treatment, and the original treatment group received the placebo solution.

Dr. Mihai Gheorghiade, a protocol co-designer of this study and a member of CardioCell's scientific advisory board, said these data showed that its therapy  improved well-being of the patients that have already been on evidence-based HF therapy.  He added:  This is very innovative and marks a new beginning in HF management, especially in light of negative results of many drug-intervention trials. 

There have also been other stem cell therapy failures in heart failure, including over the summer when Celyad missed the primary endpoints in its CHART-1 study in certain heart patients. It did however find that a  positive trend was clearly identifiable,  with its C-Cure treatment, meaning it could still try for an EMA application using the subgroup analyses.

CardioCell said future studies will necessarily be needed in larger studies with a focus on clinical endpoints to assess just how well its treatment works, and most importantly whether it can boost how well the heart works in these patients.

 Based on these promising clinical-trial findings, CardioCell is excited to be developing larger studies based on IV delivery of our [therapy] for heart failure indications, including both non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy,  says Sergey Sikora, CEO of CardioCell and co-author of the study.

 We are very encouraged by the degree of statistically significant improvement in patient health status, and we look forward to exploring whether multiple IV treatments will lead to further improvement, including cardiac function. 

CardioCell gets its therapy from parent company Stemedica, which are derived from bone-marrow.

This is a similar approach used by San Carlos, CA-based BioCardia, which earlier this year dropped plans for a $50 million IPO, which also uses a bone marrow-derived therapy. In a previous Phase II study with 30 patients its treatment CardiAMP  supported efficacy relative to patient quality of life and functional capacity, which was shown to be both statistically and clinically significant.

It s aiming for approvals in these niche indications--as well as in bigger markets for hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders.

It has secured the orphan tag for both its TG-1101 (ublituximab), a glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to treat neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and its TGR-1202, an oral, next-gen PI3K Delta inhibitor, to treat with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

""NMO is closely related to multiple sclerosis, an area of significant interest to us,  said the company s CEO Michael Weiss in a statement.  We look forward to presenting early data from our current Phase 1b study of TG-1101 in NMO at the ECTRIMS (European Committee for the Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis) conference this September, which we believe will provide an early peek into the effects of TG-1101 in patients with autoimmune diseases.""

It s looking for a larger market with TG-1101 in autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS). The company plans to advance TG-1101 into pivotal testing in MS during the first half of next year.

The B cell malignancy and autoimmune disease small cap is ultimately aiming to combine TG-1101 with approved CLL agent Imbruvica (ibrutinib), as well as with its with its own TGR-1202 to treat CLL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Discussing the GENUINE Phase III trial of TG-1101 in combination with ibrutinib in high-risk CLL, Weiss said on the company s most recent earnings call,  We've launched this study with the hope and intention that this will be a fast andstraightforward approach to getting TG-1101 approved. Recall, at the time we designed this study, we were very uncertain of what the FDA would require to get two novel drugs approved simultaneously. 

He continued,  We still believe that GENUINE's goal of improving on ibrutinib therapy represents an important treatment goal. There is no question that ibruitinib is a very good drug but few if any patients are cured with single agent ibruitinib. Our Phase II study demonstrated increases in overall response as well as a deepening of responses with 25% of the patients on the combination of ibrutinib plus TG-1101 obtaining either a complete response and/or MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity.

This is just shy of its $650 million total, according to its SEC filing, but represents a big leap over its ninth fund, completed back in 2014, which saw it hit $500 million.

In recent years the VC has helped a number of biotech companies with funding, which saw it lead a $65 million round last year for gene therapy specialist Audentes in its Series C. The biotech announced a month ago that it was now seeking a $75 million IPO.

And back in May, its portfolio company Merus announced it was gunning for a $65 million public offering on the Nasdaq to help shore up its cash for future midstage cancer trials.

The IPO market has been tricky this year for many biotechs, but VC raises have gone from strength to strength. This year alone has seen a series of major funds, including Arch s plans for a $400M-plus for venture fund, announced earlier this year, as it looks to build up on its already impressive portfolio that includes Juno ($JUNO) and bluebird ($BLUE).

California investment firm Vivo Capital, known for its big pharma and med dev raises, also in June closed a new healthcare venture capital fund at over $100 million that will include a percentage being funneled into startup biotechs.

Meanwhile, in the same month, European venture outfit Life Sciences Partners raised $280 million toward a new biotech fund--surpassing its $170 million target. Fellow European venture capital firm Forbion Capital Partners also closed is third flagship life sciences fund at  183 million ($208 million), while another VC firm, SV Life Sciences, recently announced it was nearing its 2015 target of raising $400 million in its sixth fund round.

And it s not just traditional life science VC firms either as Swiss wealth management company UBS raised $471 million in April for the final closing of the UBS  Oncology Impact Fund --an investing initiative aimed at developing new cancer treatments.

All of these together sees a total global series of funding for life sciences of around $2.5 billion.

First up, the figures, which saw operating income for the past 6 months hit  7 million ($7.9 million), up from  4.3 million it made in the same period last year, as it enjoyed the fruits of collabs with Leo Pharma in February and AbbVie ($ABBV) in April.

The latter deal was in fact worth a potential $685 million and is based around its preclinical immuno-oncology candidate, which could hit a host of cancer targets.

This contender, ARGX-115, works by stimulating a patient s immune system after a tumor has suppressed the immune system by co-opting different immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T-cells (Tregs)--which can inhibit other immune effector cells through the production of active TGF- .

The company also sold shares worth about  16 million ($17.5 million) to the major U.S. asset manager Federated Investors at the start of the year, as it looked to take a step further into the U.S. market.

The biotech has previously told FierceBiotech that it will likely one day soon seek to list on the Nasdaq. In June, the company also raised an extra  33 million from U.S. investors.

In an update on its experimental meds in the clinic, argenx said it was set to start its first combo trial in leukemia in the second half of the year, with its trial design to be presented at its upcoming R&D day.

The biotech spent  11.2 million in research by the end of June compared with the  9.3 million at the same point last year. This increase, the biotech said, was mainly due to the hiring on new R&D staffers, given its increased activities, as well as the share-based payment costs recognized in compensation for the grant of stock options to the R&D employees.

But argenx has also culled several collabs, including all research under its former pact, and exclusive product license option agreement, with Bayer.

This collaboration originally started back in May 2014 and sought to validate the SIMPLE Antibody program. But the deal has now been ended, and argenx said it  will re-deploy resources from the Bayer collaboration to support its own proprietary programs as well as its Innovative Access Program. 

It also terminated the contract with Leukemia & Lymphoma Society following the  corporate decision  to not study ARGX-110, its lead cancer candidate, in Waldestr m's macroglobulinemia.

Its CEO Tim Van Hauwermeiren was however pleased with a  seminal quarter.  He said:  We made substantial progress against several very important corporate goals: advancing our clinical and other pipeline programs and in closing a significant financing with key U.S. institutional investors as well as entering into a strategic transaction with AbbVie for our oncology candidate AGRX-115.

 We believe these accomplishments have driven argenx forward to become a new and more substantial company with a full and mature clinical pipeline, an advanced platform and the financial and strategic support to derive value from them.

 During the quarter we announced data from our Phase I MAD and SAD studies of ARGX-113 which led to the selection of our Phase II dose and demonstrated the drug's strong safety profile and its ability to rapidly reduce IgG levels in healthy volunteers.

 Our lead oncology candidate ARGX-110 showed further evidence of anti-tumor activity in T-cell lymphoma patients and is on track to announce top-line data in this expansion cohort by end of year. We are looking forward to executing on our strategic plan for the remainder of 2016 to bring ARGX-113 into two Phase II indications and to examine the breadth of potential for ARGX-110 as a monotherapy and a combination agent in TCL and AML.

This is the second time it has been hit with this warning, having had the same letter back in February. This initial 180-day period ended this week, but the Nasdaq has given it until next February to get its shares up.

Gaithersburg, MD-based GenVec ($GNVC) has not had the rosiest of times. Back in 2012, its lead program, a gene therapy for pancreatic cancer, failed to deliver in the clinic, as it desperately looked for a buyer.

A year later she left as the company struggled to remain solvent, with Douglas Swirsky, the company s former CFO, stepping in as its new chief with a new direction.

Things have been looking up in more recent months when back in July the FDA lifted the clinical hold on a Phase I/II trial, developed in collaboration with Novartis, of CGF166 in patients with severe to profound hearing loss.

This drug was created via the biotech s AdenoVerse technology platform that is deisgned to use genes to treat or stop certain diseases. But its history of poor results in the lab and financial struggles have not endeared investors.

The drug, BioChaperone PDGF, was penciled in to start pivotal trials in Europe and the U.S., but weak data from an Indian Phase III study have prompted Adocia to halt all development of the asset.

Lyon, France-based Adocia expressed surprise at the top-line data. The 252-person trial pitted the experimental therapy against standard of care--saline solution--and assessed which was associated with more completed wound closures following 20 weeks of treatment. BioChaperone PDGF failed to clear this bar, resulting in the study missing its primary endpoint. Adocia opened down 9% in Paris.

 Diabetic foot ulcer has proved an extremely difficult condition to address, as seen in multiple recent late-stage clinical trial failures,  Adocia CEO G rard Soula said in a statement.  The main reason is the lack of uniformity in the standard of care of these types of wounds. 

Over the past 12 months, Derma Sciences ($DSCI) and Israel s MacroCure ($MCUR) have both posted negative Phase III data on diabetic foot ulcer candidates. Derma scrapped its study following a futility analysis. MacroCure got to the end of its 16-week trial, but failed to show its cell therapy was better than a placebo.

With BioChaperone PDGF joining these drugs on the list of diabetic foot ulcer programs to post weak clinical trial data, Adocia has decided to drop the asset. The decision ends Adocia s ambition to test the candidate in the U.S. and Europe, and brings the drawn out final steps in the story of the diabetic foot ulcer program to a close.

Adocia posted Phase II data on the asset in 2012, at which time the performance of BioChaperone PDGF against Smith & Nephew s (LON:SN) Regranex in a 192-person study prompted the French biotech to plan to start Phase III studies in India, the U.S. and Europe within 18 months. That plan proved to be wildly optimistic. While Adocia filed to start a Phase III trial in India in September 2012, turmoil at the country s regulator meant it took almost two years to get the dossier approved.

The plan was to include data from the Indian trial in a regulatory filing in Europe, enabling Adocia to win approval on its home continent on the back of one local trial. With the Phase III fail scuttling that strategy, Adocia is shifting its attention to the bigger, but earlier-stage, opportunities in its pipeline, notably the Eli Lilly ($LLY)-partnered BioChaperone Lispro.

Adocia and Lilly have established a bedrock of early to mid-phase evidence that the insulin can give diabetics more flexibility in terms of when they take the drug. The next step is to put this to the test in a Phase III trial. Lilly had looked set to advance the drug into Phase III before the end of the year, triggering what Jefferies analysts estimate will be a  40 million ($45 million) milestone payment, but the timing has slipped recently.

In last month s quarterly earnings call, Lilly said it will start a Phase III trial of an ultra-rapid insulin in 2017, later than previously expected. The use of the term  ultra-rapid insulin  could be telling, too. Lilly has two drugs that fit this description in its mid-phase pipeline, namely Adocia s BioChaperone Lispro and an internally-developed candidate. Lilly doesn t name the internal program on its pipeline page, but it has been trialling LY900014 against Humalog over the past 18 months.

The presence of a rival to BioChaperone Lispro in Lilly s internal pipeline exposes Adocia to the sort of situation Galapagos ($GLPG) faced when awaiting AbbVie s ($ABBV) decision on filgotinib. In that case, Galapagos appeared to have the more validated drug, but the opportunity to steal a lead in the race to market and free itself from milestone payments proved too attractive for AbbVie to resist.

Adocia now faces a wait until it learns whether Lilly will follow AbbVie s lead. Lilly had already walked away from Adocia once. In 2013, it canned a partnership struck 18 months earlier, only to enter into a fresh agreement in 2014.

This is a form of multiple sclerosis that typically follows after relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

Most patients with RRMS eventually transition into SPMS in which there is progressive degradation of neurologic function; there are few treatment options for these patients.

""SPMS is a particularly disabling form of MS, and there is a need for effective treatment options to help delay disability progression in those living with the condition,"" said Vasant Narasimhan, global head of drug development and chief medical officer for Novartis, in a statement. ""The positive EXPAND data are encouraging for a disease with such a high unmet need.""

The pharma said that the oral, once-daily BAF312 (siponimod) met the primary endpoint of a reduction in disability progression risk as compared to placebo in the 1,651-patient EXPAND trial. Patients were randomized to drug and placebo at a 2:1 ratio, respectively.

It didn t disclose if the trial met the secondary endpoints of delay in the time to 6-month confirmed disability progression versus placebo, the time to confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test, T2 lesion volume, annualized relapse rate, and the safety and tolerability of BAF312 in people with SPMS.

The primary endpoint was measured at three months using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Detailed data on the primary and secondary endpoints will be presented as a late-breaker at European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in London in September.

Novartis has a substantial commitment to multiple sclerosis; it markets S1P modulator Gilenya  (fingolimod) and Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) both in relapsing MS. Extavia is also approved in Europe to treat secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in active disease patients. Novartis is also developing monoclonal antibody ofatumumab (OMB157), which it in-licensed last year from GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK), to treat relapsing MS with Phase III trials slated to start in the second half.

Via its generic Sandoz division, Novartis also markets MS treatments Glatopa (glatiramer acetate injection), the first generic version of Teva's Copaxone.

Novartis had pushed back the release of this data a bit from the anticipated mid-year timeline.

 In terms of BAF312, we originally had planned to lock the database in Q2. We will lock the database in Q3,  said Vasant Narasimhan, Novartis Global Head Drug Development and CMO, on the company s most recent earnings call.

He added,  This is primarily because of our wanting to assure that we had solid data, given the length of the study. And we had just some quality issues we wanted to resolve. 

The pharma plans to submit BAF312 to regulators to treat SPMS in 2019.

Despite the potential cautions presented by such difficult terrain, investors have plowed another $130 million into a Series B to back the startup that s led by Genentech vets. The latest infusion brings its total raised to almost $350 million.

The company has filed to start its first Phase I trial in Europe for a small molecule RIP1 inhibitor that can penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS). RIP1 is a kinase involved in regulating inflammatory signaling that can affect the brain s glial dysfunction. The drug is slated to be tested in ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and Alzheimer's disease patients, after this initial safety trial in healthy volunteers.

""Mounting genetic evidence points to glial dysfunction as an accelerator of neurodegeneration, and we believe that advancing our RIP1 inhibitor into human clinical testing is a significant step in bringing forward a novel mechanism to combat ALS and Alzheimer's disease,"" said Denali CMO Dr. Carole Ho in a statement. She was previously the VP of Early Clinical Development at Genentech.

Denali is focused on four specific pathways that it sees as triggers or effectors of neurodegeneration: degenogenes (genes that cause neurodegenerative disease when mutated), defective intracellular trafficking, glial dysfunction and axon degeneration. It aims to develop treatment strategies for each of these that are driven by biomarkers.

The South San Francisco, CA-based company ultimately aims to have a portfolio of therapies to address diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS and others. The financing and deals are aimed at  building out Denali's systematic and novel approaches and capabilities to defeat degeneration,"" described Denali CEO Ryan Watts. He was the Director of the Department of Neuroscience at Genentech.

Denali disclosed a handful of deals that give it access to a range of new technology and approaches to neurodegenerative diseases headed up by the acquisition of Incro Pharmaceuticals for its RIP1 inhibitor program that s in-licensed from Harvard University and a global license with Roche s Genentech ($ROG) to develop and commercialize LRRK2 inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

""Partnerships are central to Denali's strategy and we continue to seek collaborations to discover and develop effective medicines for patients,"" said Denali COO Dr. Alex Schuth in a statement. He was the Director and Head Technology and Diagnostics Partnering and, prior to that, the Head of Neuroscience Partnering at Genentech.

In addition, Denali disclosed a trio of research collaborations with: Washington University School of Medicine to develop and market antibodies targeting ApoE in Alzheimer s disease; the U.K. s F-Star to develop therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier; and Blaze Bioscience to research and discover drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

The latest financing was led by U.K.-based mutual fund Baillie Gifford with participation from several, undisclosed,  new and large institutional investors,  the company said. All the founding investors participated; its Series A investors include Alaska Permanent Fund, ARCH Venture Partners, Flagship Ventures and F-Prime Capital Partners.

The joint venture will use cash from both its parent companies to develop Israel-originated compounds picked out by BioLineRx, before looking for outside investment once its portfolio reaches a certain size.

Tel Aviv, Israel-based BioLineRx expects iPharma to add the first program to its pipeline in the coming months. Details of which asset it is looking at are yet to emerge, but BioLineRx has said what sort of compounds iPharma will develop. The focus is early-stage candidates, primarily discovered in Israel, that are a good fit for the therapeutic needs of China. BioLineRx is responsible for sourcing the drugs, while VC shop I-Bridge Capital is on board to provide knowledge of the Chinese market and money.

The partners are chipping in $1 million ( 900,000) apiece to help iPharma get started. This seed cash is meant to get iPharma through the process of building its pipeline of early-stage assets. Once it has completed this stage of its evolution, iPharma plans to look to outside investors for the cash it needs to grow into a fully-fledged biotech.

While the deal is small, it is part of a much larger trend that contributed to bilateral trade between China and Israel to growing from $50 million in 1992 to $11 billion in 2013. Both countries have a thing the other wants. Israel has a thriving startup scene but a population of 8 million people. China has a population of 1.4 billion people but a relative lack of startups. In the BioLineRx deal, as in many others across multiple industries, Israel is providing the innovation, China is supplying the market.

 The market in China is large and fast-growing, but it lacks innovative therapeutic assets and capabilities which address the increasing demands of our rapidly aging population,  I-Bridge Managing Partner Jimmy Wei said in a statement.  BioLineRx, with its well-established relationships with leading academic institutions and biomedical companies in Israel, as well as its proven project screening process, is an ideal long-term partner for us. 

Such partnerships are emerging as something of a sideline for BioLineRx. While the company s in-house R&D efforts have yet to live up to the hype that surrounded its $50 million Tel Aviv IPO--by far the largest biomedical offering on the exchange at the time--it has become an entryway into Israel for third parties.

Novartis ($NVS) recognized the potential for BioLineRx to fulfill this role in 2014, at which time the Big Pharma invested $10 million in the biotech and tasked it with sniffing out assets in Israel. The collaboration was slow to get going, but took a step forward earlier this month when BioLineRx secured the rights to a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis drug.

Shares in BioLineRx rose 8% on the back of the joint venture news.

The Durham, NC-based company, which is around a decade old, is working on nitric oxide based therapies for dermatologic indications, including acne.

According to its SEC-1 filing, the company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol $NOVN.

Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the immune system response against microbial pathogens and helps regulate inflammation.

Novan is working on a pipeline of meds that are designed to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action, and is the underlying tech behind its Nitricil platform. The idea is to use this platform to convert a useful, naturally occurring molecule into a therapeutic pipeline for a host of skin diseases.

The biotech is pushing on with programs in five dermatological conditions, with its lead candidate, SB204, a topical gel that targets multiple mechanisms of action for the treatment of acne vulgaris--the most common skin disease in the U.S.

Two pivotal Phase III tests started in Q1 for the med, and Novan said in its SEC filing that it expects to report top-line results from these studies at the start of next year. An NDA for SB204 should, all things going well, be on the cards by year-end 2017.

Other pipeline candidates include midstage meds SB206, SB208 and preclinical treatment SB414, which are targeted toward the treatment of either a specific microorganism or inflammatory components of a disease pathology.

SB206 is a first-in-class, topical anti-viral gel aimed at viral skin infections, such as external genital and perianal warts caused by human papillomavirus. SB208 is a topical broad-spectrum anti-fungal product candidate for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin and nails. SB414, a topical cream, is being looked at as a treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

Malin Life Sciences Holdings is currently the company s its largest stockholder.

Peterson s role sees her become the new chief medical officer of immuno-oncology at China and U.S.-based BeiGene ($BGNE) and will focus on the development of BGB-A317, the biotech s PD-1 inhibitor, and BGB-290, its PARP inhibitor, as well as other I/O candidates.

This announcement comes just three days after Pfizer confirmed its $14 billion buyout of Medivation ($MDVN), and also after some analysts recently touted larger peak sales estimates for its PARP talazoparib, which is in Phase III for BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Pfizer has over the years developed a reputation of being ruthless post-merger and cutting research programs and scientists where needs be, although it is unclear whether Dr. Peterson would have made the decision before Pfizer had decided to buy the company outright.

At Medivation, she was primarily responsible for the development of talazoparib and also of its troubled cancer candidate pidilizumab in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Before joining the Californian biotech, she worked at cancer powerhouse Genentech.

The company bought talazoparib from BioMarin ($BMRN) a year ago for just over $400 million upfront, and was a key pipeline promise on which Pfizer ($PFE) has hung its billions of dollars upon.

Her new focus, BGB-290, is currently in Phase I studies in ovarian cancer, and the biotech posted data late last year showing that of the 14 ovarian cancer patients for whom there were evaluable data, 7 had an objective response, with one having a complete response and 6 seeing partial responses.

Both BeiGene and Medivation believe their candidates will yield better results than AstraZeneca s ($AZN) approved PARP Lynparza (olaparib), which has a U.S. license as a maintenance treatment of women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.

Another small biotech, Tesaro, ($TSRO), also posted recent data for its PARP inhibitor hope niraparib, which saw some impressive ovarian cancer figures, boosting it shares by more than 100% on the day the numbers were released.

Peterson said nothing of her former position at Medivation or the reasons behind her departure, or whether it was made during the buyout attempts from Sanofi ($SNY), which have been ongoing since March.

Despite being courted by half of Big Pharma this year, Medivation has had its setbacks in the clinic, namely around pidilizumab and the confusion over its mechanism of action.

The drug--which Medivation bought for $335 million deal in 2014 from CureTech--was designed as a PD-1 treatment, but recent studies showed that it could not actually work in this way, which saw the FDA temporarily halt the trial through a partial clinical hold while Medivation took another stab at explaining the mechanism of action.

In its Q2 update earlier this month, the biotech s CEO David Hung said the company was no closer to discovering just how this experimental med should work. This would mean that Dr. Peterson had not, in fact, technically been working on a PD-1 drug during her time at Medivation.

In a statement, Dr. Peterson said:  BeiGene has a robust pipeline of clinical stage, internally discovered molecules against validated targets as well as an expanding roster of candidates in the preclinical pipeline. I look forward to leveraging my past experiences to successfully build an organization that can bring these assets to market while continuing to expand the clinical pipeline. 

BeiGene s shares were down 4.8% at end of play yesterday, with a market cap just under $1 billion.

The NDA Amgen was seeking was for its candidate Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.

In a very brief update, Amgen said the FDA has rejected it application in its current form, but gave no details as to whether this was due to concerns over safety, manufacturing of efficacy.

The nature of the letter, and especially if it required additional clinical trials, could seriously delay any approval of the med. Amgen said in a statement that it was  reviewing the Complete Response Letter, and we anticipate a post-action meeting with the FDA later this year to discuss the Complete Response. 

The FDA does not have to publicly declare the reason for its rejection, and companies can wait to make this information available. It filed the drug for U.S. review back in September, and in the same month with the EMA.

Amgen added that this wouldn t affect other regulatory submissions, but this may well depend on the issue or issues the FDA has found, and whether that will impact the drug s other reviews.

Parsabiv works as calcimimetic agent, a drug designed to mimic the action of calcium by activating the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid gland. Parsabiv, which is given intravenously, binds to and activates the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland, decreasing PTH levels.

Amgen gained access to the drug four years ago as part of its $315 million acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals. In three Phase III trials posted last year, the drug met its primary goals by significantly reducing parathyroid hormone levels.

Amgen had hoped that its new med would supplant sales of its older treatment for the condition Sensipar (cinacalcet), which last year reached blockbuster sales. Analysts have previously suggested that Parsabiv could match Sensipar's sales at peak.

sHPT is a chronic and serious condition which, Amgen estimates, affects around 2 million people worldwide on dialysis, with about half a million of these in the U.S.",Pharmaceuticals

Under the terms of the collab, which isn t disclosing any financial details, Cell Medica also gets an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement for these technologies, as well as T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and sale of specific products.

The deal will build on the research of Professor Hans Stauss and Professor Emma Morris of UCL, two big names in developing modified TCRs against oncology targets.

T cell receptors are molecules which sit on the surface of T cells. They work by recognizing antigens expressed by cancer cells.

What TCR technology does is to use this ability to target both intracellular and cell surface antigens, creating a mechanism to engineer immune cells to target certain tumors. UCL s tech, according to a joint statement, has the potential to  produce strong expression of TCRs by the engineered T cells,  which should boost its killing range when it comes to fighting tumors.

The University will carry out the preclinical and early clinical research under the auspices of a Joint Steering Committee.

Cell Medica said it will support the product development work with its  substantial experience in manufacturing clinical-grade cell therapies  while looking to also establish  robust production processes  suitable for industrial scale-up.

If and when a drug or drugs from the collab has finished up in Phase I, these treatments will then be handed over to Cell Medica for Phase II and beyond, including bringing them to market.

While not going into the exact figures, Cell Medica said has paid an up-front fee and  will make additional payments to exercise its exclusive option to license future products.  UCL, meanwhile, is eligible to receive further payments related to clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as single digit royalties.

Gregg Sando, CEO of Cell Medica said:  This collaboration adds the modified TCR technology platform to our strategy to develop breakthrough treatments for cancer using cellular immunotherapy products. The partnership with Profs Hans Stauss and Emma Morris, leading researchers in this field, should enable us to generate a pipeline of new TCR products with increased efficacy and safety for patients. 

Cell Medica, one of last year s Fierce 15, also has an ongoing pact with Houston s Baylor College of Medicine to find and develop next-gen tech for engineering immune cells in tumors.

In June they signed an expanded deal to apply CAR technology to natural killer T (NKT) cells as a novel immune cell type with biological properties that may be particularly effective for targeting solid tumors.

The Belgian cell therapy biotech has been seen as a possible IPO candidate for a couple of years, but the chatter is now reportedly turning into action.

Mont-Saint-Guibert, Belgium-based Promethera is looking to raise up to  40 million ($45 million), L Echo reports, to finance its pipeline plans. Promethera s lead candidate, HepaStem, is a formulation of allogeneic human adult liver-derived progenitor cells. The cells are extracted from donor livers, processed and reconstituted for injection, resulting in a candidate Promethera thinks can treat a variety of liver diseases.

Promethera has tested the drug most extensively in patients with the rare disease urea cycle disorder (UCD). A Phase I/II trial in that indication is ongoing. Raising  30 million to  40 million in an IPO would give Promethera the financial means to continue to advance in UCD, while also freeing it up to expand its ambitions. The biotech, particularly since John Tchelingerian took over as CEO last year, has expressed a desire to go after bigger indications than UCD.

Preclinical testing of HepaStem against acute-on-chronic liver failure and acute alcoholic hepatitis is underway. Promethera is also exploring the use of HepaStem as a treatment for hemophilia, fibrosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). None of these projects have advanced beyond very early, exploratory testing, but are potentially lucrative opportunities. The challenge for Promethera will be to persuade investors to buy into the idea that one or more of these long shots can pay off.

Investors seeking reasons to be cautious won t have to look far from Promethera s headquarters. Fellow cell therapy specialist Celyad ($CYAD) is based a few minutes drive from Promethera. Celyad had accrued far more clinical data than Promethera at the time of its Nasdaq IPO, but that didn t stop it from later failing a Phase III trial. Investors who backed Celyad at the time of the Nasdaq IPO now find themselves down 54%.

While the jury is still out on whether Promethera or Celyad will ever deliver for investors or patients, the presence of both of them on public markets would represent a significant moment for a corner of Belgium. With the Mont-Saint-Guibert-based pair being 30 minutes by car from Bone Therapeutics (EBR:BOTHE), the region could soon be home to three publicly-traded cell therapy biotechs, making it something of a hotspot for the technology.",Pharmaceuticals
Medicare Advantage plan audits illustrate overcharging," An analysis found overpayments for unsupported medical diagnoses exceeded $10,000 per patient for more than 150 patients across 37 audits.

CMS has previously stated that reducing improper payments in Medicare Advantage is a top priority, while CPI researchers have long argued that despite mounting evidence of the practice, federal officials have allowed the auditing program to fall short and let audits and appeals languish for years. The new report has added in May, a Government Accountability Office report called for a solution to the matter of faulty risk scores, and that at least half a dozen industry insiders have filed whistleblower lawsuits regarding manipulation of risk scores.

Some of the insurers found to have overcharged the government -- none of which provided comment to the CPI -- included five Humana plans, three UnitedHealth plans and four Wellpoint plans. The two plans found to have no net overpayments were Group Health Cooperative in Washington state and a Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California.

The overpayments for unsupported medical diagnoses exceeded $10,000 per patient for more than 150 patients across the 37 audits, the researchers found, adding the health plans overcharged by $2,000 or more per patient for at least 3,500 people in the sample.

In another key finding, auditors found health plans three times more likely to charge Medicare too much than too little for certain medical conditions examined under the audits.

Meanwhile, Medicare Advantage plans have long challenged the RADV audit process, with Clare Krusing of America's Health Insurance Plans calling it ""not yet stable and reliable"" and arguing CMS doesn't allow health plans to submit additional supporting data regarding patients' conditions.",Medical Devices and Diagnostics

More people are traveling abroad for medical procedures, often with the blessing of both their employer and insurance carrier. According to a recent report by Visa and Oxford Economics, the global medical tourism market totaled $439 billion in 2015 and will grow 25% annually over the next decade. That figure was subsequently revised downward to $50 billion, the International Medical Travel Journal notes, but it is still a significant market. Driving this trend are increasing access to high-quality care and services outside the U.S., lower costs, the chance to couple treatments with attractive destinations and availability of treatments and drugs not approved or available stateside.

While cost is just one reason people travel for care, it can be a compelling one if the foreign provider is reputable. Consider a knee replacement, for example. The procedure can cost anywhere from $35,000 to $60,000 in the U.S., but costs less than $23,000 in Costa Rica or India, according to The Fiscal Times. The most common procedures people travel for are heart surgery, cosmetic surgery and dentistry.

While the majority of medical tourists flock to the U.S. for care, Thailand, Singapore, German, South Korea and Spain are fast catching up, the report says. India is also a major destination for medical tourism, particularly for cardiac care. Understanding these travel patterns and the opportunities for attracting patients can provide a valuable added revenue stream for hospitals that position themselves in this market.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad each year for medical care, a mere drop in the bucket compared with the nearly 37 million patient discharges from U.S. hospitals reported in 2011.

One might expect that states like Washington, which abuts British Columbia, would see substantial numbers of individuals crossing the border north for medical procedures. But Mary Kay Clunies-Ross, spokesman for the Washington State Hospital Association, says she hasn t seen any significant impact on local hospitals.

 Some of our hospitals do get international patients, but that is usually in the context of seeking needed services from a specific program or provider (e.g., they might come to be treated at Fred Hutchison Cancer Research, or bring a child to Seattle Children s Hospital for pediatric specialty care),  she writes in an email.  I don t know of any international marketing campaign. 

Most U.S. hospitals haven t figured out that medical tourism could be a revenue diversification strategy, and they re too mired in the Affordable Care Act, PCORI reporting, managed care contracting and other obligations to promote themselves as a specialty surgery or magnet hospital destination, says Maria K. Todd, CEO of Mercury Advisory Group in Denver, CO, and an international consultant on healthcare business development.  They just don t have the bandwidth to figure out how to do the marketing campaign and study the market and still do everything else they have to do. 

Todd, who wrote ""Handbook of Medical Tourism and Program Development,"" sees two categories of U.S. hospitals taking advantage of the travel-to-care trend: Academic medical centers (AMCs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). AMCs have excess capacity and some of the latest research and technology, but they need cases on which to train new doctors. Medicare alone doesn t cover the cost of all of that training. As a result, many AMCs are using medical tourism as a diversification strategy to get different reimbursement sources into the mix,  Todd tells Healthcare Dive.

ASCs, on the other hand, are usually selling to price-sensitive customers, Todd says. She points to ASCs in rural areas that are looking for ways to compete with critical care hospitals. The federal government allows CAHs to charge 101% of what Medicare would pay a non-critical access hospital, so an ASC that s outfitted for overnight beds and can cut the cost of a procedure, and is located near a moderate-priced motel, can bundle together a price-driven medical tourism package and market it to the public.

Hospitals interested in creating a medical tourism revenue stream should build on what the facility already does well, such as hip replacements or cardiac artery bypass grafts, rather than add a service line or new staff, Todd says. Other critical factors include brand identification and destination.

 What doctors have not understood in America is how to brand themselves   and so it would be very hard for them to claim a medical tourism base, let s say, in comparison with a doctor who s a researcher who s published at the Cleveland Clinic,  she says.  Brand in healthcare translates to trust   and people want to trust that where they get their healthcare is the best choice they could have made. 

Another thing holding hospitals back is determining case rate, says Todd. With CMS  bundled case rate initiative, hospitals are having to learn how to bundle cases and that requires knowing the cost. But medical tourism is not a fee-for-service, line item percent of charges;  It s 100% give me an estimate up front,  she explains. The only way to do that well is to define a case rate with contingency for outliers for example, the rate for a stent procedure would cover three stents and any additional stents would cost $1,500 each.

 With hospitals not knowing their case rates, you can t do transparent quoting,  says Todd, who likens the situation to asking a grocer for the price of a loaf of bread and then waiting while somebody does a price check.

 The American population demands, if I m going to fly to you, you need to tell me is this going to cost $7,000 or $17,000, and most American facilities are not prepared to do that on anything more than maybe a hip or a knee [replacement] or a lap band,  she says.  They re not prepared for contingencies  such as an allergy to an anesthetic that could put the patient in intensive care.

For patients who do choose to travel for care, whether abroad or within the U.S., there s another thing to consider. Under the CPT code system, Medicare will pay for 90 days of post-operative care at no additional charge. That s already bundled into the CPT code. But that could be a problem if the patient leaves the city where the procedure was done after a week or 10 days. That leaves the patient s hometown doctor to provide the other 80 days of follow-up care, and some doctors are refusing to take patients back, according to Todd.

 Some of it is about greed, taking food off my table,  she says, noting the hometown doctor can only bill for evaluation and management, not the procedure itself. Physicians are also concerned that they could be blamed   and sued   for a complication they didn t cause. With medical complications coverage at one of the leading medical travel insurance programs capped at $50,000, that s far below the roughly $250,000 malpractice tort liability ceiling in most of the U.S., Todd says.

 You can blow through $50,000 on a case gone bad in no time flat,  she adds.  So if [people] go out of the country and they have a complication, yes, that complication insurance might kick in, but they might still charge the local doctor with the complication. ",Medical Devices and Diagnostics

BrownCalifornia's ploy is timely as it addresses a growing concern in the healthcare community that the country's aging population will outpace growth in revenues, which was recently affirmed by the Congressional Budget Office in its updated federal budget outlook report.

Seniors are financially impacted by surprise medical bills more so than Medicare when it comes to observation care because it can lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses since its considered an outpatient service.

As noted by California Healthline, patients receiving observation services may sometimes have to pay more for treatments and tests than admitted patients, adding that Medicare does not cover the costs of follow-ups in nursing homes after staying for fewer days than the required minimum of three days in a row when admitted.

Other states have passed laws similar to California's legislation such as Florida and New York. But the issue of whether providers should bill patient in-network rates or insurers should cover the extra costs is still under debate.

It stressed that final details on insurer participation and premium rates typically only become public just before the start of open enrollment, so it will be about two months before the full picture comes into focus.

KFF's findings dovetail with similar reports by Avalere and Vox that also warned of steep declines in marketplace competition and the rise of insurer monopolies.

The report makes an interesting companion alongside HHS' recent assertion that the ""overwhelming majority"" of HealthCare.gov consumers will still be able to buy coverage for less than $75 per month, just as in 2016, through the use of premium tax credits and shopping around. This is because it seems to assume the ""overwhelming majority"" will have choices.

The KFF report agrees that ""most marketplace enrollees will likely continue to have a choice of three or more plans in 2017,"" but estimates that percentage will drop from about 85% in 2016 to 62% in 2017, which could provide a solid majority who can shop around but hardly an ""overwhelming"" one.

HIPAA at 20: Looking back at two decades of patient privacy protections, The first federal law to address the privacy and security of health information&nbsp;turned 20 this month. ,http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hipaa-at-20-looking-back-at-two-decades-of-patient-privacy-protections/425378/,"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 06:56:59 -0400",NA,"HIPAA at 20: Looking back at two decades of patient privacy protectionsHIPAA at 20: Looking back at two decades of patient privacy protections

More than two decades ago, on August 21, 1996, then-President Bill Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) into law. Since then, healthcare has changed a lot and HIPAA has helped guide those changes every step of the way.

Although HIPAA was passed in 1996, it would take nearly seven years for the initial HIPAA Privacy Rule to go into effect. As the first federal law to address the privacy and security of health information, the HIPAA Privacy Rule was inherently complex. Privacy provisions in the original legislation signed by President Clinton totaled 337 words. The final rule issued in March 2002 was around 101,000 words long and spanned more than 500 pages, according to an October 2003 USA Today article.

 When the HIPAA regulation initially went into effect, it generated significant skepticism, confusion, and even angst,  Jocelyn Samuels, director of the HHS' Office for Civil Rights (OCR), told Healthcare Dive.

Criticism of HIPAA came from all directions, Samuels said. On one side, healthcare providers wondered whether HIPAA might prove to be too cumbersome and expensive to comply with. On the other, patient advocates expressed concern that HIPAA wouldn t provide meaningful protections.

In the early years of HIPAA privacy protections, HHS and OCR, which was responsible for enforcing the Privacy Rule, seemed content to let noncompliant healthcare providers slide with a warning. From April 2003 to 2008, around 35,000 HIPAA privacy violations were reported, but not a single civil fine was levied against a healthcare provider.

HHS said it had worked with around 6,000 providers reported for violations to help them achieve  voluntary compliance,  according to an April 2008 article in the Wall Street Journal. Their approach was to encourage  improvements that were constructive and were achieved more quickly than through imposition of monetary penalties.  This approach would change with the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009.

In many ways, HIPAA was ahead of its time. Although it passed before widespread adoption of EHRs, HIPAA recognized in 1996 that digitization of health data was right around the corner. One of its goals was to standardize the electronic exchange of sensitive health information. HIPAA laid the groundwork for future efforts to advance health IT and those efforts, in turn, strengthened HIPAA s privacy protections.

 HIPAA has transformed healthcare and healthcare delivery over the past two decades, evolving itself alongside of technology,  Samuels said.  The HIPAA standards have helped pave the way for the widespread adoption of the electronic health record and the interoperability of health data. 

When the HITECH Act passed in 2009, it included provisions to strengthen HIPAA privacy protections and HHS  ability to enforce them. The HITECH Act expanded compliance requirements to business associates of covered entities, required self-reporting of privacy breaches, and increased potential fines for violations to up to $1.5 million. Later that year, OCR would issue the first of many multi-million dollar fines for HIPAA violations.

HITECH changes to HIPAA were finalized in January 2013 with the release of the HIPAA/HITECH Omnibus Final Rule.  The final omnibus rule marks the most sweeping changes to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules since they were first implemented,  then-OCR Director Leon Rodriguez said.

While patients are technically afforded the right under HIPAA to access their own personal health information, this is easier said than done.  Far too often individuals face obstacles to accessing their health information, even from entities required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule,  Samuels wrote in a January blog post.

By accessing their own personal health information, patients could better manage chronic health conditions and help to coordinate their care. While HIPAA makes this a possibility in theory, it is much more difficult in practice.

Even worse, third parties often have more access to personal health information than patients themselves. Anonymized health data may be doled out for research purposes that do indeed help patients, but it can also be used for marketing and other commercial practices. In May 2014, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report showing how much personal health information data brokers are collecting.

Supposedly anonymized health data can also be used to connect medical records to the individuals to which they belong. In 2005, Carnegie Mellon University Professor Latanya Sweeney told the Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee of the Department of Homeland Security that she was able to compare hospital data to voter registration rolls to identify medical records belonging to former Massachusetts Governor William Weld.

 The public has been misled and most still have no knowledge of their lack of control over their sensitive health data,  Dr. Deborah Peel, founder and president of Patient Privacy Rights, told Healthcare Dive.  Today, no nation has a comprehensive map of all flows of personal health data. How can personal data possibly be secured, much less private, if we have no idea where it is or how it s used? 

HIPAA is an imperfect law, but, at 20 years old, it could mature and grow stronger. As OCR Director Samuels said, HIPAA has been a blue print for healthcare reform. At this point, it will likely be a mainstay in blue prints for healthcare reforms of the future.",Medical Devices and Diagnostics
Study: Depression care must be aligned with clinical needs, One expert&nbsp;recommends integrating screening tools and mental health services into primary care to address the disparities. ,http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/study-depression-care-must-be-aligned-with-clinical-needs/425345/,"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:28:19 -0400",NA,"Study: Depression care must be aligned with clinical needsDepression is one of the most common mental health disorders in the country and some believe it is under-treated. The analysis revealed that there is a gap in depression treatment and the treatment is more often than not unnecessary. If these issues were to be addressed, it could lead to healthier patient populations.

The researchers analyzed 2012 and 2013 data on 46,417 adults from Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. About 8.1% of the surveyed adults reported they had been receiving depression treatment but just 29.9% of them had screened positive. Inversely, among the 8.4% that screened positive, only 28.7% received treatment.

""I was actually somewhat surprised,"" study author Dr. Mark Olfson, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, told CNN. ""There has been a substantial increase in prescribing antidepressants over the last several years, and so I think it is tempting to assume that under-treatment of depression is no longer a big deal.""

According to Olfson, there are several reasons why patients may not want to be treated for depression such as the negative stigma associated with it or other medical conditions that may cause patient to overlook symptoms.

Findings show the most common treatment the surveyed adults were given was antidepressants (87%), followed by psychotherapy (23.2%), anxiolytics (13.5%), antipsychotics (7.0%), and mood stabilizers (5.1%). Olfson recommends integrating screening tools and mental health services into primary care to address the disparities in access to depression treatment as well as awareness of the condition, Kaiser Health News reported.

CMS proposes standards to strengthen 2018 ACA market, The proposed&nbsp;rule includes some changes to improve risk adjustment policies. ,http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/cms-strengthen-2018-aca-market-standards/425342/,"Mon, 29 Aug 2016 16:26:14 -0400",NA,"CMS proposes standards to strengthen 2018 ACA marketThe agency said it is releasing the rule earlier in the calendar year to ""provide more certainty to the marketplace as it continues to mature."" There's definitely been a fair amount of back-and-forth over the marketplace as of late as most national insurers are exiting and rethinking their exchange strategies. Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton health policy researcher and professor, recently pontificated on the exchanges' troubles saying, ""It is hard to see a way out of this dilemma, given the current political climate.""

While the exchanges are in trouble (Vox recently predicted a spike in the number of counties where there is only one choice, from 182 in 2016 to 687 in 2017), that doesn't necessarily mean the ACA as a whole is failing (20 million individuals did receive health coverage through the law). However, CMS is playing the long game and working hard to stabilize and strengthen the market. For example, the agency earlier this month asked for public comment on concerns raised about providers and other organizations directing Medicare or Medicaid-eligible people toward individual market plans, including marketplace plans.

""Right now, we are preparing to serve millions of consumers with a new set of innovations during the upcoming Marketplace Open Enrollment,"" CMS' acting Administrator Andy Slavitt said in a prepared statement. ""As we do this, we are proposing...a set of critical actions based upon our first three years' experience that, if finalized, would improve how consumers and health plans interact with the Marketplace.""

Beginning in 2018, the rule proposes to establish transfers to help spread the risk of high-cost enrollees to help improve risk adjustment policies. In addition to the risk adjustment proposals, CMS is hoping to improve the consumer experience by giving individuals additional tools to assess competing plans.

""The proposed rule would also create multiple child age bands that address instances in which consumers could face large premium changes after turning age 21; amend the guaranteed renewability regulations to provide additional flexibility for issuers to remain in an insurance market in certain situations; and codify several special enrollment periods that are already available to consumers in order to ensure the rules are clear and to limit abuse,"" the agency noted.

It added VR equipment prices have decreased by thousands of dollars with Facebook, Sony Corp., HTC Corp., among others making the market more competitive.

In addition, a recent report by SA-Business Research & Consulting Group projected the global healthcare virtual and augmented reality hardware market to grow at a CAGR of 29.2% from 2016 to 2020 and North America continued to lead the way in 2015 with a share of 41.7%.

Further research on the pain-relief capabilities of VR is needed because health systems have yet to see if using these headsets can actually have long-term effects on patients' wellbeing. VR has been found to be effective in providing other treatments including depression, phobias and anxiety. It can also serve as a physician training tool.

Twelve percent of patient service revenue came from UPMC insurance services, up from 10% from 2015 and two percentage points more than patient service revenue from Highmark (10%, down from 15% in 2015).

Novartis wins US approval for Enbrel biosimilar," Erelzi is only the third biosimilar drug approved in the U.S., following copies of Amgen's Neupogen and Johnson &amp; Johnson's Remicade.&nbsp; ",http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/novartis-biosimilar-enbrel-amgen-fda/425434/,"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 16:23:22 -0400",NA,"Novartis wins US approval for Enbrel biosimilarA decision in favor of approval had been expected after the FDA's advisory panel voted 20-0 in support of Novartis' biosimilar. Still, the green light continues the positive signaling from the agency on continued development of biosimilar drugs.

While biosimilars are more common in Europe, the U.S. was slow to adopt a regulatory structure to permit approval for copies of biologic drugs, which are more complex than traditional small molecule treatments.

Erelzi is the second biosimilar successfully developed by Novartis' Sandoz unit, which hopes to launch five biosimilars of major cancer and immunology drugs by 2020. Sandoz, the generics arm of the Swiss pharma giant, also won approval for a copy of Amgen's Neupogen last year.

The European Medicines Agency is reviewing an application for approval of Novartis biosimilar entanercept in European markets, Novartis said.

Regulators in the U.S. approved Erelzi specifically as a biosimilar rather than as an ""interchangeable product."" This means the drug is highly similar to its reference product (Enbrel) with no clinically meaningful differences. Approval as an interchangeable would indicate Erelzi is expected to produce the same clinical result as Enbrel in any given patient.

While the distinction between the two categories appears to be a case of splitting hairs, classification as an interchangeable would allow pharmacists to make substitutions between the branded drug and the biosimilar, much as they do for generic copies of pharmaceuticals.

So far none of the three biosimilars okayed by the FDA have been classified as an interchangeable.

Erelzi will be allowed for use in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The drug will also carry a boxed warning cautioning against the risk of serious infections, such as tuberculosis and invasive fungal infections.

Novartis hopes to wrest some of Enbrel s revenues, which last year totaled roughly $5.4 billion, away from Amgen. While the other two biosimilars, Zarxio and Inflectra, have so far had only modest launches, Erelzi represents a significant threat to Amgen. Sales of Enbrel account for about 25% of the company s total sales.

Interestingly, Amgen is playing both offense and defense in the race to develop biosimilar versions of top-selling biologic drugs. Even as the drugmaker attempted to fend Novarts  efforts to market biosimilar Enbrel, Amgen was developing a biosimilar version of AbbVie's Humira. That biosimilar won the backing of an FDA advisory panel the same week as Novartis' biosimilar Enbrel

Generic drugmakers have typically operated as distinct from their branded counterparts, although the lines have blurred in recent lines. By contrast, biosimilar development in the U.S. has been led by big pharma companies such as Novartis, Pfizer and Amgen.",Healthcare

In March 2015, the plant, then under the auspices of Sun Pharma, released 27 lots of clonadine HCI tablets, a drug used to treat a range of conditions including high blood pressure. This was done despite knowledge the active pharmaceutical ingredient in the tables could have been contaminated.

The plant's supplier had recalled that lot of API after an inspection had discovered insufficient controls to prevent cross-contamination.

Other failings included inadequate investigation of stability failure of felodipine tablets, another antihypertensive, discrepancies in cGMP recordkeeping and failure to allow the inspectors full access to information.

The warning letter notes, for example, that a vice president of quality ""repeatedly denied"" knowing of the clonidine recall despite e-mail evidence which showed the individual had been notified in 2014.

Previously reported Phase 2 results in a much smaller trial showed almost half of patients responding to therapy. J.P. Morgan's Anupam Rama called the results a ""grind it out win"" instead of ""home run,"" but noted the lack of a placebo response de-risked the drug a bit.

""We believe that fostamatinib has significant commercial potential given that it has a unique mechanism of action that may work where other products have failed,"" said Rigel President and CEO Raul Rodriguez in a statement.

The goal of the study was to raise patient platelet counts above 50,000/uL. Among those who met the primary endpoint, patient platelet counts rose by a median increase of 16,0000/uL to more than 100,000/uL at 24 weeks. All of the patients who met the primary endpoint have continued on the therapy and maintained the positive results.

ITP is an autoimmune disease in which the patient's immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood, which are needed for clotting and healing.

While Rodriguez is touting the therapy's potential, it might take more data for others to agree. The company was previously partnered with British pharma AstraZeneca, but the deal fell through in 2013 when fostamatinib failed in a trial for rheumatoid arthritis.

Other therapies have tried to administer large amounts of stem cells directly to the heart via catheter or surgery, but those efforts have always failed. The CardioCell trial showed IV administration might be the best route. Yet, the company will still have to pass the Phase 3 hurdle.

The single site study included 22 patients that were randomized to either itMSCs or placebo, both delivered via IV. Patients were checked at baseline, 90 days and 180 days.

""Based on these promising clinical-trial findings, CardioCell is excited to be developing larger studies based on IV delivery of our itMSCs for heart failure indications, including both non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy,"" said Sergey Sikora, CEO of CardioCell and co-author of the study, in a statement.

Celyad, another developer in the space, announced in June its stem cell therapy flopped in Phase 3. The biotech tried to salvage the news and pointed to positive trends in a subgroup population.

Mylan bites back at system with generic EpiPen," Responding to continued criticism of its steep price increases for EpiPen, Mylan will launch a generic copy of its own drug&mdash;at half the cost.

In in its latest response, Mylan will launch a generic version of EpiPen, which will be identical to the original branded product. The company indicated the generic copy will be released on the market in several weeks after completion of labeling revisions.

Last week, Bresch made several comments on CNBC which deflected blame from Mylan and criticized the overall healthcare system, drawing the ire of the industry:

""That $608 is a list price. What Mylan takes from that, our net sales is $274. So $137 per pen. And against that, manufacturing the product, distributing the product, enhancing the product, investing. When we took over this product eight years ago, there was very, very little awareness. We took on   we have doubled the lives of patients that are carrying an EpiPen. We have passed legislation in 48 states to allow undesignated EpiPens to be in schools,"" Bresch said, defending the 400% price hike on EpiPen since 2007.

Now, in direct response to the continued criticism, Mylan will be offering a generic version of EpiPen via direct-mail, cutting out pharmacies.

""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response, which required the cooperation of our partner,"" said Bresch in a statement on August 29.

""However, because of the complexity and opaqueness of today's branded pharmaceutical supply chain and the increased shifting of costs to patients as a result of high deductible health plans, we determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option,"" she added.

Mylan intends to continue offering the cost-savings and discount programs associated with the branded version of the drug.

""Mylan also continues to fight for enhanced access to epinephrine auto-injectors through other measures, such as inclusion of the product on the federal and private insurance preventive drug lists, which could potentially eliminate all co-pays,"" the company wrote in the statement.

The controversy over EpiPen came to a head last week when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released a statement about the product, calling for a lower price. This was compounded by letters from several members of Congress demanding Mylan explain the price increases.

EpiPen is an epinephrine auto-injector that is used in emergency situations. The product counters anaphylactic shock caused by allergic reactions, such as those triggered by certain foods or bee stings.",Healthcare
Martin Shkreli Sells Stake in KaloBios,KaloBios also outlined its priority goals as it continues to transform the company,http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/industrynews/2016/martin-shkrelis-sells-stake-in-kalobios/,"Tue, 30 Aug 2016 20:13:00 -0400",NA,"Martin Shkreli Sells Stake in KaloBiosKaloBios Pharmaceuticals Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on advancing medicines for patients with neglected and rare diseases, announced the sale by Martin Shkreli of his remaining shares of KaloBios common stock, fully eliminating his association with the company. KaloBios also outlined its priority goals as it continues to transform the company.

In private transactions, Shkreli sold his entire stake in KaloBios directly to other investors. He has zero ownership of the capital stock of, or ongoing financial interest in, the company. In addition, under the terms of the governance agreement announced July 7, Shkreli continues to be restricted from certain further actions concerning the company for a period of time.

 This transaction enhances our flexibility to execute the company s strategy by removing an impediment to progress,  said Cameron Durrant, MD, KaloBios chairman and CEO.  The new KaloBios strategy is to leverage available U.S. regulatory incentives as a framework to swiftly and cost-effectively advance and strengthen our portfolio for neglected and rare diseases, with an interest in pediatric conditions. 

KaloBios has set out key near-term goals in executing this strategy:

1) Benznidazole   expect to have U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Pre-Investigational New Drug (IND) application meeting within the next six months to confirm the regulatory pathway for benznidazole in the treatment of Chagas disease, a neglected tropical disease.

2) Lenzilumab   continue enrolling patients in the company s ongoing Phase 1 study of lenzilumab for Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), with the expectation to use the data to help inform a possible study in Juvenile Myelomonocytic Leukemia (JMML), a rare pediatric condition.

3) Corporate   regain compliance with periodic reporting requirements of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and seek relisting on a national stock exchange.

KaloBios emerged from Chapter 11 bankruptcy June 30 with $14 million in equity financing. The company acquired the rights from Savant Neglected Diseases LLC to develop benznidazole for the treatment of Chagas disease and has initiated a Phase 1 study of its monoclonal antibody candidate lenzilumab for the treatment of CMML.",Biotechnology

Erelzi is the second biosimilar from Sandoz approved in the United States through the FDA biosimilars pathway established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.

""We continue to increase patient access to key treatment options by expanding our offering of biosimilars which helps to reduce costs within the healthcare system"" said Carol Lynch, Global Head Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz.

""Sandoz is proud to have developed two of the three biosimilars that are currently FDA approved, which further demonstrates our commitment to US patients in a growing number of therapeutic areas. We are committed to bringing Erelzi to the US market as soon as possible"".

The FDA approval follows a unanimous vote (20-0) by the FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee (AAC) in July to recommend use in all indications of the reference product. The approval is based on a comprehensive package of analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data confirming that Erelzi is highly similar to the US-licensed reference product. Clinical studies included four comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in 216 healthy volunteers and a confirmatory efficacy and safety similarity study in 531 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Extrapolation to all indications approved for use on the reference product label is on the basis that the Sandoz biosimilar etanercept and the reference product are essentially the same.

An application for Sandoz biosimilar etanercept has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency (Q4 2015) and is currently undergoing review.

I think of this and the catchy associated  be all you can be  jingle often as I stumble down to my office in the morning, turn on my computer, and proceed to waste the majority of my morning on 150 different disjointed tasks. Productive army recruits: 1, Karen: 0.

As I was reveling in the irony of stalling my productivity the other day by reading articles online about increasing productivity, I came across a Q&A with James B. Duke, Professor of Psychology and Behavioral Economics at Duke University. He says that people are most alert in the first two hours of the day, and thus have the propensity to be the most productive during these hours. Key word here is propensity.

Turns out, most of us squander these golden productivity hours because our morning routines are so scattered. So what can be done to increase morning efficiency? Well, here at Pharmaceutical Manufacturing, we want to make the lives of busy pharma professionals easier.

With that goal in mind, we are proud to announce the launch of our newest eNewsletter, Daily Dose. It comes out first thing in the morning, Monday through Friday, and features a concise rundown of news and articles to get your day started on the right track

Our aim continues to be to help readers by providing authoritative, practical and impartial technical information as well as details on best practices, key trends and developments; and our new, mobile-optimized daily newsletter format helps us do this as expeditiously as possible.

We will also use the Daily Dose platform to alert you to great material we produce at Pharmaceutical Manufacturing. These offerings range from our valuable educational webinars to our newest ebooks and digital issues. You can sign up for the Daily Dose here.

On a personal note, I m excited to be part of our brand s very first daily launch (and your morning routines) because of the true value I think this newsletter will provide. Our editorial staff will be at our desks well before 9 a.m. each morning making sure you are seeing the freshest, most-current content that will hopefully help kick-off productive mornings for you.
