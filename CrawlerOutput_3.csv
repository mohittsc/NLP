The Big Pharma is framing the action as a  voluntary reallocation program  that will see it reduce its global R&D headcount by nearly 3% while it ups its investment in other areas.

The cuts, news of which was first reported by Stat, follow shortly after Lilly detailed plans to ax 485 employees in response to the failure of its Alzheimer s trial. But, according to the company, the aim this time is different. Lilly is looking for 200 staffers from multiple R&D sites around the world to voluntarily sign up to leave the company.

While the earlier, larger cuts followed the fading of expectations for solanezumab and subsequent retreat from the program, the latest action is being pitched as a tweaking of the Lilly R&D machine ahead of renewed investment in specific areas of the operation.

 Lilly is focusing its investment in new R&D capabilities to ensure portfolio sustainability. We plan to increase our investment and hire in strategic areas, including molecule-making capabilities, immunology and Alzheimer's disease, across our U.S. research sites later this year,  a spokesperson who confirmed the cuts said in an emailed statement.

The reference to U.S. research sites is notable given the political climate in which Lilly is operating. News of the cuts emerged days after Lilly CEO Dave Ricks talked up  his hiring of manufacturing staff in a meeting with President Donald Trump. Given Trump s willingness to single out firms for criticism on Twitter and uncertainty over his approach to biopharma, there is value in being seen to be on board with the  America First  approach, particularly as it relates to jobs.

Lilly s statement also suggests the company is pushing ahead in Alzheimer s despite the setbacks it has faced. Jobs related to Alzheimer s research are among the 34 open science positions at Lilly as of today. Lilly is also looking to add a team leader at its neuroscience R&D unit in the U.K.","Pharmaceuticals"

If approved, caplacizumab could be the first drug therapy for the condition known as acquired thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (aTTP) which results from an impaired blood clotting enzyme and causes very low blood platelet counts and the formation of microclots, leading to organ damage.

Caplacizumab stops that clot formation, says Ablynx, and if approved it would be the first alternative to plasma exchange therapy in patients with the disease, which has a 20% mortality rate per episode.

The drug could be the first commercial product for Ablynx, which is one of Europe's top-tier biotechs, employing around 400 people and with eight programs in clinical trials. Ghent-based Ablynx estimates the annual market potential for caplacizumab to be around  800 million, and it is now targeting a possible launch for the drug in the first half of 2018, with a U.S. filing expected around the same time, according to CEO Edwin Moses.

The filing is based on phase 2 data from the TITAN trial, with a phase 3 trial called HERCULES running at the moment and due to generate results later this year. TITAN showed that caplacizumab treatment could reduce the time to platelet count normalization by around 40%, and it reduced recurrences while on drug treatment by around 74%.

Moses told delegates at the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference last month that he reckons that caplacizumab could grow into a  400-million-a-year product at peak, and the company thinks it can sell it on its own with a small sales force.

Getting the drug filed will be a ""huge step forward to us all young biotechs aspire to taking a drug all the way through development and commercialize it themselves,"" he said.

Ablynx estimates that around 7,000 to 8,000 people present with aTTP in North America, Europe and Japan each year, with two-thirds being new diagnoses and one-third relapsed cases.

Ablynx focuses on ""nanobodies,"" which are around one-tenth the size of a regular antibody, making them easier to administer, and can be linked together to hit multiple targets.

The pipeline includes inhaled treatment ALX-0171 for respiratory syncytial virus infections in midstage trials, and interleukin-6 (IL-6)-targeting nanobody rheumatoid arthritis candidate vobarilizumab.

AbbVie declined to pick up rights to vobarilizumab last October, possibly because there is already one IL-6 inhibitor on the market Roche's Actemra (tocilizumab) with new inhibitors from Sanofi/Regeneron and GlaxoSmithKline nearing the market and increasing competition from other drugs such as JAK inhibitors.

Moses said Ablynx would step up efforts to find another partner for the drug after end of phase 2 meetings with the FDA and EMA in Europe.","Pharmaceuticals"

Alongside its cash boost and top exec, the startup has also licensed an investigational candidate, CTI-1601, designed to treat Friedreich's ataxia, from Indiana University Research and Technology Corp. and Wake Forest University Health Sciences.

The funds will be used to push on with the development of CTI-1601 and to boost its exec and management team, with its labs now based at the Science Center in Philadelphia. Chondrial says it will soon ask for an IND by the FDA so it can start a phase 1 test of its new compound.

It added in a statement that it also plans to  advance [a] pipeline of product candidates focused on the treatment of rare mitochondrial diseases. 

New CEO Dr. Ben-Maimon, who has spent a quarter of a century in biopharma management and research, joins Chondrial after serving as an adviser with Deerfield Management.

She said:  The $22.6 million Series A financing, combined with the licensing of CTI-1601, is a watershed moment for Chondrial. I believe the company is in prime position to advance a potentially groundbreaking therapeutic for patients with Friedreich s ataxia and capitalize on a broader vision of targeting and treating rare, debilitating mitochondrial diseases.

 We are very appreciative of Deerfield Management, which led the financing and will be providing continuing strategic and operational support. Additionally, we look forward to working with the scientific community, the Friedreich s Ataxia Research Alliance, and the FDA to advance this important therapeutic. 

Discovered by co-founder Dr. Mark Payne while at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center, CTI-1601 uses a carrier protein to deliver frataxin, the deficient protein in Friedreich s ataxia, to the mitochondria where researchers believe it is processed to mature frataxin and becomes active in mitochondrial metabolism.

This genetic disease is a debilitating, life-shortening, degenerative neuromuscular disease that occurs in about 5,000 people in the U.S.

People with Friedreich s ataxia have very low levels of frataxin, so Chondrial's big idea is that by replacing the deficient protein, the mitochondria will resume normal function, patients  symptoms may be minimized, and disease progression may be held back.

This comes a few months after Horizon Pharma s Actimmune missed the primary endpoint in a phase 3 trial in the rare neurodegenerative movement disorder, sparking a 20% drop in its stock price.

The study set out to show that interferon gamma-1b could improve outcomes in patients with Friedreich's ataxia, but the drug failed to move the needle.","Pharmaceuticals"

The Bristol-Myers Squibb-partnered checkpoint inhibitor failed to improve leukemia-free survival by more than placebo.

Innate enrolled 150 people in the trial and randomized them to receive one of two doses of the anti-KIR monoclonal antibody or a placebo. The clinical trial failed to find a statistically significant difference between either treatment arm and the placebo in terms of leukemia-free survival or any other efficacy endpoint. The across-the-board failure is a stumble at the first major clinical efficacy hurdle faced by lirilumab.

 Although we knew that this setting was challenging, we are disappointed by the results of the EffiKIR study and will investigate further to better understand the data in its entirety,  Innate Chief Medical Officer Pierre Dodion said in a statement.

The first hint that lirilumab could come up short arrived when the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB) completed its fourth review of the study in March 2015. At that time, the DSMB recommended stopping treatment in one of the arms as it was already unable to beat placebo. In unblinding the study, Innate has revealed the DSMB recommended stopping the higher of the two doses, dispelling earlier assumptions that the lower dose was more likely to struggle.

That finding and the other results of the phase 2 AML trial raise doubts about the odds of success in the suite of studies set up by Bristol-Myers and Innate. Since paying Innate $35 million ( 33 million) for the rights to lirilumab, Bristol-Myers has kicked off a clutch of trials to test the anti-KIR monoclonal antibody in combination with drugs including its PD-1 drug Opdivo.

Innate is clinging to interim phase 1/2 results suggesting lirilumab boosts the efficacy of Opdivo in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck as evidence of the potential of its asset as it heads toward a critical series of data readouts.

 EffiKIR is only one of seven studies currently investigating lirilumab. Lirilumab is tested in a broad and comprehensive combination program in multiple indications and we saw encouraging early efficacy signals of lirilumab in combination with nivolumab at the 2016 SITC meeting. We are looking forward to the next data sets as well as the next steps for the program in 2017,  Dodion said.

Bristol-Myers initiated the combination trials to test the idea that targeting KIR and PD-1 will deliver better outcomes than going after the latter pathway alone. While Opdivo blocks the inhibitory effect of PD-1 receptors on T cells, lirilumab is designed to stop KIR2DL-1,-2,-3 inhibitory receptors from interacting with their ligands. Together, the drugs have the potential to unleash T cells and natural killer cells at tumors, resulting in greater efficacy than Opdivo alone.

Clinical trial data backing up the theory would deliver a boost to Bristol-Myers, which is rocking from setbacks in the clinic and seeking an edge over Merck s Keytruda and other PD-1/PD-L1 drugs that are set to start challenging for the market.

More than 60% of participants were alive two years after starting treatment, sparking a 40% surge in the stock price of Targovax.

The study gave TG01, a peptide-based RAS immunotherapy, in combination with standard of care to pancreatic cancer patients who had undergone resection. Of the 19 evaluable patients, 13 were alive two years after resection. One patient died shortly after passing the milestone, resulting in only 12 patients being alive two years after starting treatment. But whichever start date is used, the two-year survival rate clocks in at upward of 60%.

To put this figure in context, Targovax looked at two-year survival rates from studies that treated resected pancreatic cancer patients with standard care, gemcitabine. Across the five earlier trials, two-year survival rates ranged from 30% to 53%.

Investors were cheered by the comparison, although Targovax is conscious of the risk of reading too much into data from a small, single-arm trial.

 We are encouraged by the two-year overall survival rate of patients treated with TG01 in this trial, versus the expected rate from published historical data when treating with gemcitabine alone, the current standard of care. Whilst acknowledging the small size of this first patient cohort and the lack of a control arm, we are encouraged by what seems to be a signal of efficacy in this highly malignant and difficult to treat cancer,  Targovax CMO Magnus J derberg said in a statement.

Targovax sees the data as sufficiently encouraging to push ahead with TG01, the first candidate to emerge from its TG-Peptide platform. The platform is designed to deliver injectable peptide-based immunotherapies that treat patients whose tumors express RAS mutations. These mutations, which are common in pancreatic cancer, correlate with poor health outcomes. Targovax thinks TG01 can improve the lot of these patients by inducing an immune response.

The ability of TG01 and follow-up compounds from the same platform to live up to this billing will shape the fate of one half of Targovax s operation. The other half, a pipeline of adenovirus-based immunotherapies, became part of Targovax when it merged with Oncos Therapeutics in 2015.","Pharmaceuticals"

Tarveda is focused on developing a new class of drugs called Pentarins that act like antibody-drug conjugates combining tumor targeting that spares healthy tissues with a toxic payload but  are around 50 times smaller, in principle allowing them to penetrate more deeply into cancers. They are bigger than small molecule drugs, but this is another benefit it stops them being cleared from the body too quickly, according to the biotech.

Tarveda said its latest Series D fundraising, led by new investor Versant Ventures, will help it advance lead candidate PEN-221, which targets somatostatin receptor 2 (SSTR2), through proof-of-concept.

""PEN-221 phase 1 dose escalation and safety data is expected to be available late this year, and we will be positioned to initiate phase 2a studies early in 2018,"" Fromkin told FierceBiotech, noting that the phase I trials will use an FDA-approved imaging diagnostic to select patients whose tumors express SSTR2.

Advanced neuroendocrine tumors and small cell lung cancer are the two malignancies linked most closely to SSTR2 and represent a market opportunity of around $1.5 billion for PEN-221 on their own, said Fromkin. ""There is a deficit of curative treatments for these cancers and new and effective treatments are desperately needed.""

Meanwhile, the cash injection will also help Tarveda advance its second Pentarin candidate HSP90-targeting drug PEN-866 into phase 1 dose-escalation and safety studies due to start in the first half of 2017.

""PEN-866 will initially be focused on patients with topoisomerase-I inhibitor sensitive tumors,"" said Fromkin. Those tumor types are found in patients with small cell lung cancer, sarcoma, pancreatic cancer, and gastric cancer, to name a few.

As well as taking both PEN-221 and PEN-866 through early-stage clinical studies, the funding is giving the company scope to broaden its pipeline of Pentarin candidates beyond its two lead programs, both for ""collaboration and internal development,"" according to Fromkin, who says news on additional candidates will be forthcoming during the course of 2017.

On the subject of partnerships, he told FierceBiotech that the augmented pipeline would allow it to attract potential collaborators.

""We have optionality around when and with which programs we decide to create value through collaboration with pharmaceutical and other partners, said Fromkin.  ""In any event, the platform is yielding opportunities for new, valuable Pentarins and this enables both proprietary and partnered development.""

The fundraising is the first for the company since it rebranded from Blend Therapeutics to Tarveda last year, spinning out its former lead cancer drug BTP-114 into a new company called Placon Therapeutics in the process.

Versant partner Dr. Guido Magni will join Tarveda's board of directors, who said the company's ""rapidly maturing pipeline, including two clinical-stage candidates, demonstrates the prolific nature of the Pentarin discovery and development engine.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The admission follows a report in The Street about the death the third linked to the same side effect that wiped more than 40% off Stemline s stock price.

The events date back to last month. On January 19 Stemline filed a prospectus with SEC to raise money. The offering was priced the following day, generating $45 million for Stemline. What has now become clear, following The Street article and subsequent company statement, is Stemline was told on January 18 of the death of a patient in a phase 2 trial of SL-401. Stemline disclosed its knowledge of the death on February 2.

In a statement, Stemline said the patient developed capillary leak syndrome (CLS), the same side effect linked to the deaths of two participants in earlier studies. When Stemline designed the second part of its phase 2 trial of SL-401 in blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm (BPDCN) a rare blood cancer it added dosing and safety parameters to the lead-in stage of the study to cut the risk of severe CLS.

The precautions looked to be working. When Stemline presented data from the potentially-pivotal trial at the 2016 American Society of Hematology Annual Meeting in December, it reported 19% of the 32 evaluable patients had experienced treatment-related CLS. No patients enrolled since the precautions were implemented experienced a severe form of the side effect. And only 8% of the overall study population had suffered grade 3 or above CLS.

Stemline is yet to determine the cause of the patient s death, but it appears to threaten the clean safety record the company was accruing. What, if anything, that means for the prospects of SL-410 remains to be seen.

If all goes to plan, Stemline will wrap up enrollment in the BPDCN study in the coming months, setting it on a path it thinks will lead to a filing for FDA approval before the year is over. With the trial generating an overall response rate of 84% and complete response rate of 56% as of the December update, the efficacy aspect of the plan looks to be on track.

Analysts at Jefferies were not impressed, and questioned management's decisions. ""STML reported it received notification of a patient death on Jan. 18 but believed this was not material and the reason this was not disclosed earlier. Recall that two patients deaths from CLS had been observed earlier in the trial (1 BPDCN pt tx'd at 7ug/kg/day and 1 r/r AML pt tx'd at 16ug/kg/day),"" the firm said in a note to clients.

""Prior to this event and after new safety protocols had been implemented, STML reported no CLS >Grd 2 at ASH '16. We feel that the lack of disclosure highlights the inability of mgmt to make decisions with shareholders in mind. Further, as of 8:00pm STML has not returned our calls. Collectively, we believe that the most meaningful upside to the stock would be remedies to regain investor confidence. Furthermore, we would advise mgmt to host an investor call where these issues may be addressed.""","Pharmaceuticals"

In the  removed from phase 3  box coming out of its morning presentations on Thursday, Feb. 2, it said it has dropped a late-stage combo treatment of PD-L1 candidate durvalumab and CTLA-4 med tremelimumab (which has seen its own trial setbacks) in first-line metastatic pancreatic ductal carcinoma (the Alps study).

This also comes after its recent decision to change up its timings on a study of durvalumab in squamous cell head and neck cancers (HNSCC).

The Big Pharma confirmed to me:  With recent changes in the HNSCC competitive landscape, including the approval in the U.S. for PD-1 monotherapies for recurrent or metastatic HNSCC with disease progression on or after platinum-containing chemotherapy, and based on [overall survival] data in all-comer patients, we will not make a regulatory submission for accelerated approval based on the single-arm phase 2 Hawk trial in PD-L1 high patients and the uncontrolled randomised or the phase 2 Condor trial (in PD-L1 low/neg patients). 

The company said it  remains committed  to developing durvalumab both on its own and in combo with tremelimumab for patients with recurrent metastatic HNSCC:  Through the delivery of the phase 3 randomized controlled clinical Eagle trial (in second-line HNSCC) with data expected in 2018, and the phase 3 randomized controlled clinical Kestrel trial (in first-line HNSCC) with data expected in H2 2017.  Both studies are enrolling all-comer patients, the company added.

Moving further back down the pipeline, four NME phase 2 meds have also been axed and divested, including its outlicensing of GI candidate MEDI2070 to Allergan a few months back, with MEDI7510 also now in limbo.

This candidate is a respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) sF antigen plus GLA and works as a synthetic molecule licensed from Immune Design s GLAAS discovery platform, and was being studied by MedImmune, AstraZeneca s biologics arm.

A spokesperson for the company tells FierceBiotech:  Based on the initial efficacy results from the phase 2b study, we decided not to proceed with the second-year safety and immunogenicity follow-up phase of the MEDI7510 study. We are currently conducting a full and thorough evaluation of the phase 2b results to determine next steps. 

RSV candidates have had a tough time of late, and just this week Aviragen said its BTA585 drug failed to have any impact on viral load in around 20 adult patients given an intranasal inoculation with the virus, the most common cause of acute lower respiratory tract infection in children.

Back in September, Novavax also saw its shares plummet when it announced that a late-stage test of its RSV vax had missed all of its marks across a 12,000-strong study.

And AstraZeneca/MedImmune have had setbacks here too: Back in 2010, the Big Pharma wrote off its big motavizumab program for RSV after it failed to make the grade. Motavizumab was intended to replace the blockbuster RSV drug Synagis.

And even further back in phase 1, the U.K.-headquartered Big Pharma said it had divested its NDMA suicidal ideation drug AZD8108.

CEO Joseph Patti said some biological activity was seen in the trial but there was a lot of variability in the viral load seen in patients and that coupled with a small number of patients made it difficult for the study to show an effect.

At the moment the only option for the 2.1 million or so children in the U.S get RSV seriously enough to warrant medical attention is supportive care inhaled ribavirin is sometimes used but has limited efficacy, while at-risk children can receive a preventative shot of AstraZeneca's Synagis (palivizumab).

For kids with established infections which in some cases can be life-threatening there is a pressing need for drugs that can tackle the virus. Efforts to develop RSV treatments have so far yielded no fruit, although Johnson & Johnson, Gilead Sciences and Ablynx have drugs in clinical testing. Meantime, progress towards a preventative vaccine has also been patchy. Novavax' RSV vaccine failed a phase 3 trial last year but remains in development, while Bavarian Nordic has a candidate in phase 2 trials.

The lack of available treatments helped BTA585 bag a fast-track designation from the FDA, but Aviragen hit a hurdle last year after the regulator placed the drug on clinical hold, requiring toxicity data in juvenile animals before the company can proceed to testing the drug in children. The company is hoping to get the clinical hold relaxed later this year.

The question mark hanging over the BTA585 program means Aviragen is banking on a good outcome in the phase 2b SPIRITUS trial of lead drug vapendavir, a drug intended to treat rhinovirus infections, and BTA074 for anogenital warts which is in a midstage trial due to complete enrollment in the third quarter.

SPIRITUS is assessing vapendavir in moderate and severe asthma patients to see if the drug can prevent asthma attacks, and results are due in the next few weeks. According to the company, 45% to 80% of asthma exacerbations are linked to viral infections, and two thirds of the thought to be caused by rhinoviruses.","Pharmaceuticals"

The UCB-partnered investment group hopes to leverage the money, links to academic centers and accelerators around the world and the experience of a leadership team including Sir Chris Evans to build a portfolio of high-potential drug development startups.

London-based Arix is designed to funnel scientific discoveries and investment opportunities from around the world to a team of biotech, VC and Big Pharma veterans for evaluation. Having raised  52 million privately in February 2016, Arix s tendrils had pulled in 452 opportunities for the team to review as of November. Arix invested in five of these opportunities, and it is now ready to back two or three times as many again by adding  100 million to its operation.

 Arix has privileged access to some of the world s most innovative businesses via links with academia, research accelerators, our own fund management organization and extensive industry networks. We believe we can build businesses which improve outcomes for patients and unlock value for investors,  Arix CEO Joe Anderson said in a statement.

Anderson, who spent 12 years as a partner at Abingworth, is one of several notable names on the senior leadership team at Arix. Evans, a serial company creator, serves as deputy chairman. Former Amgen and Novartis CFO Jonathan Peacock occupies the role of chairman. Franz Humer, the former CEO of Roche, is involved as a senior independent nonexecutive director.

To date, the team has overseen direct investments in five companies, including well-funded CAR-T startup Autolus, DNA damage response player Artios Pharma and OptiKira, a biotech Arix is connected to through its relationship with U.S. accelerator BioMotiv.

Arix s investment in BioMotiv, ownership of Arthurian Life Sciences and agreement with research sites including the Max Planck Lead Discovery Center give it an indirect stake in more startups and a source of investment opportunities. The list of Arix s academic agreements includes universities in Dundee and Manchester, institutions that are based well outside of the U.K. s life science hotbed but have well-established reputations in biopharma.

The plan is to strike agreements with more universities and build out the industrial partnership side of the operation. Arix has already teamed up with UCB for a partnership that could see them build companies together. Discussions with other biopharma companies are underway.","Pharmaceuticals"

In its financials this morning, Pascal Soriot said that, of course, talks with Europe on what Brexit will be haven t happened yet, so there is still a lot of uncertainty.  But it is logical to assume that the EMA will have to stay in Europe, and that the U.K. will have to have its own agency, but I think here this can work quite well actually, provided that several things happen,  he said on a call.

 One is that the U.K agency works proactively with the EMA [ ] and work to recognize each other s approvals. The second would be that the U.K agency would be agile and focused on innovation, as well as new technology and products, and in doing so could actually support the introduction of new technology. 

This echoes the U.K.'s health secretary Jeremy Hunt, who a few weeks' back told a health committee:  The EMA is an EU institution. I think it's likely EU countries will want to move its headquarters outside the U.K.""

This comes a few months after fellow U.K. Big Pharma CEO, the out-going Sir Andrew Witty, warned of  tremendous disruption  if the EMA left town.

Sir Andrew was worried that moving the EMA and its 900 staff members from London to another European city post-Brexit will cause upheaval that affects the smooth running of the regulatory machinery.

On the impact of Brexit on his company and the industry, Soriot said:  As business people, once a decision has been made, whether you like it internally or not, you have to look for the opportunities and make the best of it.

 And I actually do think there are opportunities for the country, for the industry and for our company [on Brexit], and I think that the [U.K.] government is very committed to developing an industrial policy, and in particular one for life sciences. 

He said there have been in recent weeks statements on R&D as well as investment from the government in academic science that are all positives, and financial commitments in the manufacturing sector.

 This is important,  he says,  and I can tell you the industry, and us as a company, we have had very rich dialogue with the government as recently as this week. There is a very good and very strong, collaborative spirit, and from our point of view in the science and regulatory sense, I think we can do great things. ","Pharmaceuticals"

In the Q4 update call to journalists and analysts, Soriot said:  We actually believe in a strong, science-led FDA. We are a science-led organization that thrives to hit high scientific standards and so we would expect the FDA to be well staffed and focused also on those standards. 

But he said that there are always opportunities to  do things better  and so  we continue to engage with the FDA to do what that have done very successfully in oncology over the past few years, which is finding new pathways to accelerate approvals of new drugs or indications.

 If you look back over the past few years, quite a number of breakthroughs in cancer in oncology have been brought to patients in the U.S., and the oncology department [from the FDA] has been trailblazing from the point of view. 

He cautioned that there is a limit to  how fast we can go in doing those things well. 

This comes as Trump sat down with a number of Big Pharma chiefs earlier this week and said he was seeking to cut down on regulations at the FDA, and was also likely to, as part of a broader hiring freeze across the country for federal employees, reduce headcount at the agency in the coming years through attrition.

Trump said at the meeting:  We re going to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations. We re going to be cutting regulations like nobody has ever seen before.

The San Diego, CA-based biotech, which will be chaired by former president of global research and early development at Celgene Tom Daniel in an executive role, says it is focusing on treating  major unmet clinical needs using the first platform for proteome-wide ligand and target discovery. 

Daniel will help run things from the start, but the search is on for a permanent CEO, the biotech tells me.

Its platform was spun out of the labs of Vividion s scientific founders, a team of experts in chemical biology and synthetic chemistry from The Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, CA, which includes Benjamin Cravatt, Phil Baran, and Jin-Quan Yu.

Its platform  expands the definition of druggability,  Daniel explains, on mechanisms in serious illnesses, while  delivering new routes to address highly validated disease targets. 

The biotech was founded back in 2014 but has been in stealth mode in the intervening years, with double digit staffers that Daniel expects  to grow aggressively  in both biology and chemistry.

What have they been doing with their stealth time? Daniel said:  It became clear around the time of founding that the platforms emerging from the Cravatt lab had tremendous potential for expanding druggability of the human proteome. Between 2014 and present, these platforms were further optimized, refined, and applied in several important biological systems, bolstering confidence in their transformative potential to discover progressable chemical leads for compelling, but previously intractable targets. 

He said that during this period:  We also integrated the platforms with disruptive chemistry methods developed by co-founders Phil Baran and Jin-Quan Yu, which has provided unprecedented access to new chemical space of provocative structural and functional content, thus endowing Vividion with an integrated and highly differentiated approach to efficiently discover and progress drug candidates for compelling protein targets. 

It starts of course as preclinical and the biotech is not giving up timelines just yet on when they expect to be in the clinic.

In terms of targets, Daniel said:  We have several targets of interest in diseases ranging from oncology to immunology to rare genetic disorders. While we are not disclosing these yet, they meet the following criteria: proteins with compelling human biology validation, and proteins that have proven heretofore difficult to drug by conventional means.

 In a nutshell, we believe that any protein has the potential to be drugged with the Vividion platform and therefore are using a rigorous human biology filter for target selection and prioritization. 

And the name?  Our platform is that we assess drugs and targets directly in native or  living  biological systems hence, the origins of  Vivid. And our platform also has a strong mass spectrometry component hence, the origins of  ion . 

And when you say its name, it s pronounced  vivid-eon. ","Pharmaceuticals"

Management kicked off the hunt after a phase 3 failure blew a hole in Ophthotech s hopes of bringing its wet AMD asset to market.

Until December, Ophthotech was focused on getting its wet AMD candidate Fovista through a pair of phase 3 trials and onto the market as a way to improve on the efficacy of Novartis' Lucentis. The publication of data showing the addition of Fovista to Lucentis failed to improve visual acuity over the Novartis drug as a monotherapy dented that prospect, prompting Ophthotech s board to enlist Leerink Partners to help it weigh up strategic alternatives.

As it stands, while all options are up for discussion, Ophthotech is more interested in being a buyer than a seller. The plan is to look to land the rights  to additional products, product candidates and technologies to treat ophthalmic diseases, particularly those of the back of the eye.  By pairing such assets with its existing expertise in ophthalmic diseases, Ophthotech thinks it can secure itself and its shareholders a potentially-lucrative future despite the travails of Fovista.

 We believe that with our expertise and experience in ophthalmology we are well positioned to explore and critically evaluate a variety of opportunities that could include in-licensing, acquisition and collaboration opportunities,  Ophthotech CEO David Guyer said in a statement.

Ophthotech has cash to realize the plan it was sat on $321 million at the end of September and has rejigged its team to enact the strategy. Glenn Sblendorio is no longer covering both the CFO and COO roles. Instead, Sblendorio will serve as CFO and president, leaving SVP Keith Westby to step up to the COO position. Guyer talked up Sblendorio s business development experience in his explanation of the reshuffle.

The team will hunt for deals while overseeing the completion of a phase 3 trial that is administering Fovista or a placebo on top of either Regeneron s Eylea or Roche s Avastin. That trial is due to post data in the middle of the year. If that study joins the Lucentis trial in the flop column, Ophthotech will be left with a phase 2/3 geographic atrophy candidate and whatever its business development team can rustle up.","Pharmaceuticals"

In all, the company presented updated data from 13 patients (up 2 from former data posts) treated with PBS and 14 with CHI (up from 7 previously reported) in phase 2a trials, and the biotech said that in the latter group, in acute studies,  have met their objectives of establishing initial safety and 358 proof-of-concept aged 12 and up across several dosing levels. 

It said it is also  nearing  a multi-dose study in children with CHI aged 2 and up, which is slated to be done in the U.K.

Meanwhile, the PBS study has completed dosing in the single-dose cohorts, and has also met its objectives, the biotech said, adding that a a multi-dose study has also been started.

The drug is a fully human negative allosteric modulating insulin receptor antibody derived from the XMet platform.

Analysts at Jefferies took a measured view, saying:  Given the limited data we believe it is still too early to build XOMA-358 into Xoma s valuation. Two critical features that need to be determined are the durability of the treatment (and long-term treatment potential) and whether XOMA-358 raises the glucose levels in younger patients (patients between 2-12). The latter is important as some CHI patients tend to 'outgrow' their CHI around the ages of 10-15yrs. 

A lot is riding on this med as back in 2015, the company was hit by a catastrophic failure of a key development program that knocked Xoma into penny stock territory. The company reported that its Servier-partnered drug for Behcet's disease flunked a late-stage study.

The biotech, which reportedly laid off staff in a reorganization, was left with a share price that had shrunk 80%, but later signed a life-extending deal with Novartis that involved out-licensing a cancer med to its long-term partner.","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, while public advocacy groups and politicians expressed dismay about the proposal, Trump s plan received more favorable feedback from BIO and PhRMA.

Trump used yesterday s meeting with leaders of the pharma industry to outline a plan to  [cut] regulations like nobody has ever seen before.  The goal is to remove unnecessary FDA regulation. And, as Trump sees it, a lot of regulations fall into this category. Up to 80% if regulations could get the chop of Trump gets his way.

The proposal has met with criticism.

 President Trump s promise to cut regulations and speed up the drug approval process at the FDA is a dangerous idea. These regulations are in place for a reason. When lives are at stake, it is an outrage that President Trump would consider putting the profits of pharmaceutical corporations ahead of safety,  Congresswoman Rosa DeLauro said in a statement.

Lobbying group Public Citizen was similarly damning about what it described as  Trump s horrifying proposal.  Public Citizen said the plan  reflects utter ignorance  about the role of FDA and will  destroy the ability of the agency to protect patients and consumers from unsafe or ineffective medications. 

The industry is, publicly at least, more upbeat about Trump s plans. BIO said Trump s desire to  cut unnecessary regulation  is an idea it has been advocating for, but made no comment on whether it sees eye to eye with the President on what proportion of regulations are unnecessary.

PhRMA was similarly enthusiastic about the plan to remove  outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation.  When combined with Trump s broader plans for tax and trade, PhRMA thinks the regulatory cuts could create 350,000 jobs over the next decade.

The plan to cut the number of FDA regulations is part of a broader debate about the purpose of FDA and how it will function under Trump. Comments made by the President, his advisors and potential candidates for the top job at FDA suggest Trump is open to rethinking the agency s role as a gatekeeper.","Pharmaceuticals"

Like much of biotech after Trump s pharma fireside chat yesterday, its shares ended the day up nearly 3%, boosted by talk of slashing FDA regulations and what some interpreted as a slightly lighter tone on pricing.

But they came crashing down just a few hours later when, after hours, the biotech s shares tanked 65% after top-line phase 2 data showed edasalonexent (a.k.a. CAT-1004) after failing to beat out placebo in 31 Duchenne patients with the measure of change in lower leg muscles.

Edasalonexent is an oral NF-kB inhibitor and unlike other DMD therapies such as Sarepta's injectable Exondys 51 (eteplirsen) which was approved last year for a specific genetically-defined group of patients could potentially be used in patients regardless of their underlying mutation, says the company.

Just two weeks back the biotech also posted a phase 1 trial that showed its drug was found to be safe when given to adults and reduced levels of NF-kb, an inflammatory mediator that the company believes is activated in the very early stages of DMD and is critical to the progressive muscle degeneration seen in the disease.

The data were published in the Journal of Clinical Pharmacology, and saw its shares up 20% on that positive turn.

But its latest phase 2 trial, known as Part B of MoveDMD, was always the bigger test, and its failure has proved disastrous for the company. It said in a statement that it plans to:  Complete a full analysis of the data from Part B of the MoveDMD trial and to submit the data for presentation at an upcoming scientific conference.  Its shares ended at just $1.38 last night.

Jill Milne, CEO of Catabasis, said:  Although we did not meet the MRI T2 composite end point, the continued safety, tolerability and plasma exposure data in Part B of the MoveDMD trial are reassuring.

There is an open-label extension portion of this test, known as Part C, that is still ongoing; Catabasis says it intends to report the results from Part C in 2017, with an interim update in Q2.

Milne added:  We observed potential treatment-associated effects at 12 weeks in the 100 mg/kg/day treatment group, which we believe warrant further evaluation to see if the signals strengthen in the longer-term data from the ongoing open-label extension. Following additional data analysis from the open-label extension, we will determine the next steps for edasalonexent in DMD. 

This will be doubly damaging to the company given that it comes just a few months after writing off its midstage cholesterol drug CAT-2054. The biotech is also developing the NF-kB inhibitor for Friedreich s ataxia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and cystic fibrosis.","Pharmaceuticals"

The signatories (PDF) from across the subcommittees of health, energy and oversight said:  We urge you [Trump] to consider carefully how instituting a federal hiring freeze will affect FDA. We would remind the Administration that FDA is tasked with approving novel drugs and medical devices to improve how we prevent and treat medical conditions, as well as approving generic drugs that provide critical competition to the market and affordable access to medications for families. 

The agency currently has around 1,000 vacancies, much of them at the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER), and the letter's authors want to know just how this freeze will hit these roles.

There has also been a hiring push clause embedded in the 21st Century Cures Act (and the $500 million it got from its passage), which is designed to help the FDA speed up its processes, but they also asked whether this would impact recruitment there too, and if so, why.

They said that  hamstringing  the ability of the country s  most critical public health agency  to take on much-needed staffers  will hamper FDA s ability to fulfill its mission and meet the performance metrics, including timelines for medical product reviews and approvals, negotiated with industry under the user fee agreements. 

The FDA is currently being run by Acting Commissioner (and former Deputy Commissioner) Dr. Stephen Ostroff, who replaced Dr. Robert Califf after he handed in his resignation on Trump s inauguration.

Democratic senators have also sent a letter (PDF) to Dr. Ostroff asking the same thing, specifically on how this would hit its ability to approve new meds and medical devices, and how Trump's attrition plan would hit it long-term.

The senators, which include Elizabeth Warren, said: ""A hiring freeze at the FDA would conflict with and do significant damage to these bipartisan efforts to fill vacant positions and expand the scientific and technical workforce needed for a robust review of drugs and medical devices. Patients and their families can't freeze the progress of a disease while the FDA waits to fill critical positions.

""Drug and device manufacturers can't freeze their research and development while the new administration imposes its political ideology. Suspending efforts to fill vacant positions, and create new positions required to implement the 21st Century Cures Act and the new user fee agreements will do serious damage to the FDA's capacity to carry out its mission.""

Trump is said to have met with a series of tech and VC leaders for the role, and could introduce a new leader and direction for the agency should one of his more radical picks make it into the top seat.

He said during his campaign last year that he wanted to stop hiring new federal employees to reduce the cost of government, while also lowering the level of regulation countrywide.

Speaking today at a roundtable meeting with pharma heads, Trump said:  We re going to get rid of a tremendous number of regulations. I know you have some problems where you cannot even open up new plants. You can get approval to open the plants and then you can't get approval to make the drug.

 We re going to be cutting regulations like nobody has ever seen before. And we're going to have tremendous protections for the people, perhaps even more protections for the people. But instead of being 9,000 pages, it can be 100 pages. 

He also said:  We re going to streamline the FDA. We have a fantastic person that I think I will be naming very soon. We're going to streamline the FDA.

Now, armed with a couple of red flags from the design of the trial, Seres has gone back to FDA for feedback ahead of taking another run in the clinic.

The design of the new trial will be informed by the two points Seres thinks could have affected the result of the earlier phase 2.

One potential explanation of the failure, as Seres sees it, is the use of PCR to test for C. difficile. Most subjects were diagnosed using PCR. But, having analyzed stool samples from an open-label using that test and a cytotoxin enzyme immunoassay, Seres thinks use of PCR may have resulted in people without recurrent C. difficile infection being enrolled in the trial. And, once the study was active, the test could have overestimated recurrences.

Seres has also taken a look at the dosing, specifically by comparing change in spore species richness in participants in different arms of its phase 1b and phase 2 trials. To Seres, the analysis suggests suboptimal dosing of some patients in the phase 2 could have contributed to the failure of SER-109 to best placebo.

Taken together, the misdiagnoses and dosing analyses amount to a  strong rationale  for taking SER-109 deeper into clinical development, according to Seres. The plan is to design a trial that uses the C. difficile cytotoxin assay to determine whether a patient is eligible to enroll and assess the recurrence endpoint. Seres wants to use a higher dose of SER-109, too.

Exactly what the next step in development looks like will depend on the outcome of talks with FDA. Seres has kicked off the process by sharing its analyses with FDA, but will only get a clear idea of the path forward once the agency has its say.","Pharmaceuticals"

The Japanese drugmaker says it has taken a worldwide license to AU-935, a growth factor that emerged from the labs at Stanford University and could be used to make eardrums regenerate. TMP is generally caused by middle ear infections or trauma, or in people who have grommets fitted to prevent fluid build-up in the middle ear.

Most ruptures heal spontaneously, but some persist for months, and chronic TMP results in hearing loss in more than 50% of cases. At the moment, the condition is treated surgically by cauterizing the edges of the rupture, or plugging the hole using a tissue graft, although eardrops are sometimes used to manage discharge from the ear.

It's a big healthcare issue, with an estimated 100,000 surgeries carried out in the U.S. every year and around two thirds of graft procedures failing to repair the damage effectively.

AU-935 has the potential to be another option for those patients. It is based on heparin-binding epidermal growth factor-like growth factor (HB-EGF), a protein which is thought to play a role in wound healing.

Stanford University researchers reported in 2015 that HB-EGF was able to heal chronic TMPs in animal models, outperforming another growth factors fibroblast growth factor (FGF) that has also been tested for TMP.

Japanese drugmaker Nobelpharma is developing a formulation of FGF called NPC-18 for TMP that according to its website is in the latter stages of development, with marketing applications due later this year.

The two companies aren't talking about the financial terms of the deal but getting a big pharma partner on board is something of a coup for Auration headed by life sciences veteran Ben McGraw who is also CEO at TheraVida which was only set up two years ago. The firm has been pretty much flying under the radar but it emerges has been talking to Astellas about a licensing deal since 2015.

Astellas is paying an upfront fee, covering the cost of developing and commercializing AU-935, and committing to milestones and royalties on sales if the drug makes it through to market.","Pharmaceuticals"

Now Rick Fair has become the latest to leave a Big Pharma as he exits as head of oncology at Roche/Genentech to become the new CEO and president of Texas biotech Bellicum.

Fair, who played a key role in the launch of five SMEs at the company, including Roche s new I-O med Tecentriq, joins Bellicum as it prepares its global regulatory and commercial strategy for its leading phase 1/2 med BPX-501 in blood cancers, as well as advancing its pipeline of controlled CAR-T and TCR product candidates.

Fair succeeds Tom Farrell, who will serve as an adviser to the company  during the transition,  according to a statement from Bellicum.

The biotech banked $140 million in an upsized, above-its-range IPO back in 2014. Perhaps not as well-known as the likes of Kite Pharma and Juno as well as Novartis, Bellicum believes its approach to immunotherapy makes it a standout in the fast-crowding space, which could see the first-ever approved CAR-T this year.

Each of the biotech s CAR-T candidates uses technology derived from BPX-501, a T-cell therapy designed to ward off graft-versus-host disease in patients undergoing stem cell transplants.

The company's platform comes with a so-called safety switch which it says can mute unwanted transplant reactions like cytokine release syndrome, a common response to CAR-T therapy that had occasionally proven fatal in early studies.

 We are delighted to welcome Rick to Bellicum,  said James Brown, chair of the biotech.

 Rick s depth and breadth of experience in oncology, clinical development strategy and commercialization, both in the U.S. and internationally, will be of great value as we prepare for commercialization of our lead product candidate BPX-501, accelerate our pipeline of CAR T and TCR product candidates, and solidify our leadership in the development of controllable cell therapies. 

 I am both honored and thrilled to join Bellicum at this exciting time,  added Fair, who also spent a number of years at Johnson & Johnson s pharma unit.

 Cellular immunotherapies have shown great promise in treating cancers and blood disorders. Bellicum is the leader in molecular switch technologies, has advanced multiple novel and highly differentiated therapies into the clinic, and is preparing to bring its first product to market.

"Dr. Ashish Jha on how providers should consider APMs"," Hospitals need&nbsp;to pay attention to the policy world and understand there&rsquo;s going to be many&nbsp;new developments for APMs over&nbsp;the next three to five years. ","http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/ashish-jha-alternative-payments-models-APMs/435471/","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 14:03:47 -0500","NA","Dr. Ashish Jha on how providers should consider APMsDr. Ashish Jha, K.T. Li Professor of Health Policy at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and director of the Harvard Global Health Institute, last week told Healthcare Dive that he views current alternative payment model (APM) efforts   bundled payments and ACOs, for example   as version 1.0 and hospitals should be expecting big changes in that space over the next few years.

APMs were a big component of the Quality Payment Program that CMS released last October. APMs aim to improve beneficiary outcomes and engage patients through patient-centered policies. Providers that receive 25% of Medicare payments or see 20% of their Medicare patients though an Advanced APM in 2017 will earn a 5% incentive payment in 2019, according to the Quality Payment Program website. A lot of activity and benefits around APMs still have yet to be seen though some changes have already occurred since CMS finalized QPP. For example, last December CMS finalized its cardiac and joint bundle payment programs.

Jha   who along with colleagues published a paper last week which found elderly Medicare patients treated by doctors from non-U.S. medical schools had a lower mortality rate than patients treated by doctors from U.S. medical schools   sat down with Healthcare Dive during AcademyHealth's National Health Policy Conference to discuss APMs and what hospitals should consider when looking toward APM participation in the future. Here are some of the main takeaways from the conversation.

Jha stated he thinks policymakers have been convinced finding a way to pay for healthcare over a longer period of time via broader bundles or perspective payments for a population will lead to both lower spending and better quality. ""I think the evidence on that is still out; I think we re also still learning how to do this,"" Jha said. Though we're still in a learning phase, Jha said, ""APMs are here to stay. The idea that somehow this is an experiment that we will decide is not working and go back to the old standard is not happening. Not in the next 10 years and probably not ever. I say that because there s broad support for alternative payment models from the Democrats and Republicans. This is not a partisan issue. Obviously, they have slightly different takes on how to do this but I think alternative payment models are here to stay.""

Hospitals have misunderstood what it takes to be successful under APMs, according to Jha. Hospitals have focused on buying practices and becoming large and vertically integrated and while Jha understands why hospitals make that decision, he notes there's little evidence such strategies are useful and thinks providers are making a mistake by focusing on size.

""It s not about physically owning your physician practices,"" Jha said. ""It s much more about what kind of relationships you have, how you communicate and the reason I bring that up is because if you look at some successful alternative payment model organizations   organizations that are doing well under these new schemes   a lot of them are small physician practices that aren t part of a hospital. Or they're independent hospitals that don t have a large physician base.""

Jha said there are many ways to be successful without being big. He highlighted good communication, integration of clinical services and being proactive in identifying the right patients to give extra support to as strategies providers will find most helpful. ""You can build very good communication interfaces with doctors in your community without owning them,"" Jha said, adding, ""If you re going to win the game under alternative payment models, it s going to be focusing on the bread and butter of how to deliver better care much more than it is large organizational changes.""

""I think of APMs as the future,"" Jha said. ""MIPS is fine as an alternative but my guess is most organizations are going to end up in some sort of alternative payment model and I can imagine an organization that doesn t have a good IT system or doesn t have good clinical practices may want to start with MIPS but overtime, I think most organizations should know they will end up in some version of an alternative payment model. So whether they start working now or whether they re going to get there in two years, that s where everything is heading. I think MIPS is at most a step along the path but it is not a destination.""

During his panel on APMs at the conference, Jha stated pay-for-performance (P4P) measures   one of the primary mechanisms to improve quality before experimenting with other models   have mostly been a bust if the goal was to improve the outcomes of patients who get care in those models. Though he noted he's been a fan of P4P measures for a long time, he stated the evidence at this time does not support that such measures have greatly improved patient outcomes.

The standard, classic pay-for-performance model which is essentially fee-for-service with a 1, 2, 3% bonus based on whether certain quality measures are met or not has been mostly a failure, Jha said. He thinks the industry shouldn t give up on pay-for-performance and instead pick a smaller number of high-value measures while putting more incentives on the table. However, Jha acknowledges others think P4P should be scrapped altogether.

""If you scrap pay-for-performance altogether, what do you do under APMs? Under APMs, my sense is what you need to have is really robust quality measures,"" Jha said. These should include measurements that matter to patients and clinicians and incorporate them as a fundamental part of the model used for individuals to get paid out. Patient reported outcomes and other information not easily gotten from claims data could be made central to such efforts.

""I think these models need ongoing experimentation and changes,"" Jha said during his panel. One area that could be experimented with is the timing of bundles. Jha stated there's nothing magical about 30 or 90 days attributed to readmission dates. However, there is a problem if the time period is wrong. For example, if the time period is too long, then incentives to forgo healthcare services for unrelated things could be created. ""I think we need more clinical nuance on the time period,"" Jha said calling for an analysis to look at the empirical evidence to determine more clinically rational time periods. ""There are all sorts of interesting questions that we need to actually test out in the real world as opposed to saying we're moving to bundled payments for half the country,"" Jha said.

""I think for hospitals the key is to pay attention to the policy world and understand this is going to change rapidly,"" Jha told Healthcare Dive adding there will be many changes coming down the pike in the next three to five years. ""What we re seeing now in terms of bundled payments and the way we re doing ACOs is probably not how it will look in five to 10 years,"" he said. ""We re trying a bunch of stuff. Some of it is working. A lot of it is not. I can imagine there will be constant tweaks and changes to these programs especially under the new administration.""

Jha stated hospital executives should be focused on the fundamentals of having strong relationships with doctors in their community, good information flow and streamlining processes to be lean and effective. ""That is going to prepare you for whatever model comes down the pike next,"" Jha said.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

This is important because the young and healthy people needed to stabilize the ACA risk pools have historically signed up in the final days on open enrollment.

Supporters of the law blamed the Trump administration move to halt advertising and some outreach for the lull during last six days of enrollment.

About 3 million of those who signed up were new consumers and its far from clear what kind of coverage they will find available. Top Republicans have recently tamped down their calls for immediate repeal of the ACA because they are worried about suddenly taking coverage away from millions of people. Trump has pushed for quick action, but the interview that aired Sunday signals he may be on board for a more measured approach.

The numbers released late last week do not include the 11 states that run their own exchanges and are not limited to those who have paid premiums. A more detailed report is expected in March.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

The federal healthcare law allowed states to expand the Medicaid program and this has yielded positive results for many hospitals' bottom lines. However, the expansions are among the parts of the ACA that the GOP is expected to reconsider even though many of the states that have expanded Medicaid have Republican governors.

Medicaid expansion led to reduced bad debt and improved financial health, according to the executives that spoke to Slavitt. Different studies on Medicaid expansion states have showed mixed results about emergency room use. The growth of ED visit rates has slowed down in these states but use has remained high in Oregon.

Slavitt was most surprised with the results of a poll that found 39% of hospital executives are reducing hiring because of the uncertainty surrounding the ACA's fate and 31% are reducing capital expenses. The hospitals' top priority is cautiously adopting value-based care, Slavitt said.

The ACA uncertainty could continue for some time. On Sunday before the Super Bowl, President Donald Trump in an interview said an ACA replacement may not be ready until 2018, The New York Times reported. Meanwhile, health insurance companies have also been dealing with the uncertainty by warning they would leave the marketplaces if a replacement coverage plan isn't agreed upon by April.

Several replacement plans have already been introduced by several Senators, including Sen. Rand Paul (R-KY), Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) and Sen. Susan Collins (R-ME). A unified plan on ACA replacement has not been presented by Republicans at this time.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

Average cost of care was slightly higher when patients were treated by IMGs than by physicians who trained in the United States, but there were no significant variations in other performance measures, like readmissions, considered by researchers. The results suggest that standards for selecting IMGs for practice in the United States are higher than for physicians trained in the United States.

After adjusting for differences in patient condition and physician characteristics, 30-day mortality rates were 11.2% among patients treated by IMGs and 11.6% among patients treated by physicians who trained in the United States. Researchers considered Medicare data for more than 1.2 million hospitals covering more than 44,000 internists to reach their conclusions.

While a higher bar is set for IMGs to practice in the U.S., the selection process improves quality of care. Lowering the bar to allow more IMGs to practice in the country could have the adverse effect of lowering the quality of care.

Additionally, with IMGs accounting for around a quarter of the physician workforce, attempts to limit immigration could have implications for quality of care, as MedPage Today reported. President Donald Trump's recent executive order limiting immigration from seven countries could have an adverse affect.

Many studies have looked into variations in outcomes depending on patient population. However, it seems that it is becoming more common for researchers to examine how differences in physician characteristics affect outcomes. For instance, some research suggests that female doctors are generally more encouraging and reassuring, more likely to engage in shared decision-making with patients, and likely to spend more time with patients, as Dr. Pauline Chen wrote for The New York Times.

There are some tools that healthcare organizations can deploy to make care more standardized. For instance, John Hopkins Hospital discovered an apparent gender bias when it looked into blood clot prevention treatment. Close to one-half of female trauma patients did not receive appropriate treatment compared with 31% of men. Implementing a simple checklist allowed the hospital to eliminate preventable blood clots in all patients.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

 The traditional  silos  of medical, behavioral health and social services can t meet the needs of our population alone,  Jim Hickman, CEO of Better Health East Bay, which is a part of Sutter Health, told Healthcare Dive.

There is good reason for health systems to engage in these activities and to explore non-traditional partnerships to improve health. A growing body of evidence suggests that social, behavioral, and environmental factors have enormous effects on physical health. This has led hospitals to spearhead initiatives that, for instance, build parks, create access to health foods, and help people to get their GED or find jobs, according to the Health Affairs post.

Payers are also increasingly taking on a larger role in the communities where they operate. Humana recently began allowing employees to take paid time off to volunteer. Employees who take advantage of the policy are not only giving back to their communities, they are also improving their own well-being.

Healthcare organizations, which are frequently well-recognized and major employers in areas where they operate, are powerful enough to make an impact when it comes to addressing certain societal problems.

A new administration has taken office, and like clockwork, we once again are debating the future of healthcare and Medicare.

This would have happened regardless of who won the election last November. Yet this year, the Medicare debate will be different as steps have been taken over the years, thanks to both political parties, to truly make Medicare sustainable. Specifically, the transformation of Medicare from a fee-for-service system in which doctors are paid for doing more  stuff  to a value-based one in which they are paid for better health outcomes.

A key part of this transformation is the Medicare Shared Savings Program (MSSP) in which accountable care organizations (ACOs) can care for Medicare beneficiaries, be paid for it, and if they save Medicare money, keep part of the savings. CMS recently announced that in 2017, 480 ACOs are enrolled in the program and they cover over 9 million Medicare beneficiaries, or about 23% of all beneficiaries in original Medicare. In just four years, the MSSP has grown to be half the size of Medicare Advantage.

This staggering growth does not happen without a concentrated, multi-stakeholder effort. The National Association of Accountable Care Organizations estimates that starting up an ACO costs on average $1.6 million, indicating that more than three-quarters of a billion dollars in private investment has been made in the MSSP ACOs. And, the government has been active in improving the program. Notably, CMS created a sustainable future for ACOs by transitioning over time to regional benchmarks to judge success. Then in 2015, Congress updated the entire Medicare payment program and put its stamp on the transition to value in its bipartisan MACRA legislation, a law whose success is very much tied to the success of the MSSP.

Despite this progress, more investment and more fine-tuning will be required if we are to strengthen the MSSP and use it to help power the transformation of Medicare to a value-based system.

First, CMS needs to tailor the risk for MSSP ACOs so that it is enough to motivate, but not sink a small practice. It s critical that the risk small practices take on bears some relationship to the financial resources of the ACO and its members. If it s too much so that a bad year that happens because of an external event   such as an epidemic or disaster   can sink even the most well-intentioned practice, then no one will enter into an ACO arrangement.

In MACRA s Track 1+, CMS began to address this issue by capping downside at 8% of Medicare Part A and Part B revenue received by the members of the ACO. By connecting risk to the revenue ACO members receive from Medicare, CMS finally can determine what level of risk an ACO is actually taking and identify whether an ACO is in compliance for more than nominal financial risk. It s an important change that opens the door for ACOs of all sizes and make-ups to continue their progression of taking more and more accountability of their patients. However, there are still improvements to be made in allowing ACOs to choose when to move into risk rather than having to wait till the end of three-year contract periods, and in providing greater rewards to motivate them to do so.

Second, we need an accurate way to measure whether or not an MSSP ACO creates value. The best way to do that is through a difference-in-difference approach. In this, the key question asked is: Did a Medicare beneficiary get better care at lower cost in the ACO than if that same Medicare beneficiary had not been in the ACO? To get closer to this difference-in-difference approach, CMS needs to move away from national inflation updates and artificial risk-scoring methodologies to regional inflation updates and direct risk scoring.

Third, CMS should continue to seek to simplify the program. For example, while we appreciate the work that was done in Track 1+, it is quite possible all of the same benefits could have been accomplished by adding just a few lines of changes to Track 2 without the need to create a whole new track. This would have been both simpler and created a better business case for physicians to move towards risk.

Finally, CMS should create a path and a roadmap for transitioning from MSSP to capitated payments under Medicare Advantage. The Next Generation ACO model developed by the Innovation Center provides a model for how different segments of medical costs could be capitated over time, with CMS continuing to process claims and providing stop-loss reinsurance. The key missing piece in the Next Generation ACO framework is a transition of the benchmark from purely historical to risk-adjusted Medicare Advantage premiums.

The MSSP wouldn t be where it is today without the private investment and innovation that has occurred, and without the willingness of CMS to evolve the program as the ACO/CMS partnership matures. If CMS continues to improve upon the program, the investments will be made, and ultimately, Medicare will be strengthened for the benefit of us all.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

But it s not a wholesale warming to a more measured  repair  approach.  To repair the American healthcare system, you have to repeal and replace this law, and that s what we re doing,  House Speaker Paul Ryan (R-WI), said during a TV interview with Fox & Friends.

During his weekly briefing with the reporters, Ryan said Republicans would repeal and replace the ACA by the end of this quarter.

In a Wednesday hearing of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, chairman Lamar Alexander (R-TN) said Republicans may have to help foot the bill to keep insurers from exiting the market and leaving individuals without coverage, according to The Hill.

 Republicans are going to have to do some things we may not normally do, like cost sharing or reinsurance,  the senator said.  We may not like those things, but we may have to do those things for the next two to three years to make sure people can buy insurance. 

Marilyn Tavenner, president and CEO of America s Health Insurance Plans, the industry s main lobbying group, told HELP that continuation of premium subsidies and cost-sharing reductions through 2018 are needed to keep the market from deteriorating further, FierceHealthcare reported.

Other measures that are needed include recalibrating premium subsidies to get more young people to sign up for coverage, incentives for continuous coverage and federal funding for high-risk pools, she said.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

""Our preliminary results show that there is a significant impediment to readily identifying Medicare s total costs caused by a medical device recall, a device that prematurely failed, or a necessary device upgrade,"" the OIG stated.

Insurers and patient groups have long pushed for inclusion of DIs on claims forms to help flag dangerous or defective devices before they hurt patients by enabling analysis of comparative outcomes. The Global Unique Device Identifier Database allows hospitals and other to download information about devices by entering the unique device identifier (UDI), though payers are currently left out of the loop.

In a joint letter sent last July, the FDA and the CMS asked X12 to include UDIs for device implants on Medicare claims forms. The committee s new recommendation moves the needle forward. Former CMS acting Administrator Andy Slavitt reacted to the news on Twitter.

 Adding device information to claims is a commonsense approach to improve patient safety and reduce costs,  Ben Moscovitch, manager of health information technology at Pew, told Modern Healthcare.  There s widespread support across the healthcare system for adding it to claims. 

The draft recommendation is open for public comment for 90 days, after which X12 will finalize it. Once that happens, it will be handed off to other advisory committees for review and then submitted to the HHS and the CMS for sign-off and rulemaking.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

Meanwhile, Cigna said it has made no decision regarding Anthem s notice seeking an extension of the merger completion date, Reuters reports.

If the Anthem-Cigna deal fails to go through, Cigna would still have up to $14 billion to spend on other mergers and acquisitions, Forbes reports.  We have excellent flexibility,  Cordani said during a fourth-quarter earnings call.  All alternatives are available to us. 

 The government s case against a Cigna-Anthem merger involves markets for large employer insurance, or the national account market   i.e., employers with more than 5,000 employees and operations in more than one state. Currently, four payers serve this market: Cigna, Aetna, UnitedHealthcare and the Blue Cross Blue Shield network, of which Anthem is the largest player.

Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini told investors on Tuesday that the company won t sell in ACA exchanges where it pulled out last August and is still weighing whether to continue in the four states where it remains.

Now that Republicans in Congress are fighting to repeal and advancing health reform proposals that would likely undo some of this progress, AARP is fighting back.

The 3:1 age band restriction established by the ACA limits how much more payers charge older patients than they charge younger patients. Most states had previously allowed payers to charge older patients five times as much as they charge younger patients for similar plans. Shifting to a 5:1 age band restriction would increase yearly premiums for the average 64-year-old with a silver health plan by $2,100, according to the AARP. A Commonwealth Study published in September predicted this change would cause 400,000 older patients to lose coverage.

While Medicaid is more frequently associated with low-income individuals rather than the elderly, many of AARP s constituents benefit from the public health program. In fiscal year 2012, Medicaid paid $140 billion for long-term care services and elderly patients accounted for 61% of this spending, according to the AARP Policy Book. That was before the ACA delivered additional funding to long-term care, home health care and community-based services that many elderly patients use. AARP has urged Congress to keep that funding.

AARP represents 38 million older Americans,  a demographic that happens to be an essential part of the Republican voting coalition,  Jonathan Cohn told the Huffington Post. If Republicans move forward with some of their health reform proposals, they risk starting a fight with AARP, which has considerable amounts of sway among that coalition.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

As such, Eli Lilly did not give further details on how many employees would leave from certain units or therapeutic research areas.

Plans to increase employment in immunology and Alzheimer's make sense, though, given that CEO David Ricks said continued pipeline expansions for those therapeutics areas were a priority for the company during a fourth quarter earnings call last week.

On the other hand, these most recent job cuts contrast that generally positive call. The Indianapolis-based drugmaker beat analyst expectations due to strong showings from its diabetes franchise, with particular emphasis on Trulicity (dulaglutide), which had $337 million in global sales during the period. Meanwhile, U.S. revenues across all products jumped 14% to $3.2 billion.

Last month, the company eliminated 485 field positions relating to the late-stage failure of its highly anticipated Alzheimer's drug, solanezumab. Employees affected from those layoffs were placed on ""reallocation"" statuses that lasted 12 weeks, during which they had ""the opportunity to post for open, available positions through Lilly's internal posting process,"" according to a Jan. 6 letter addressed to the Indiana Department of Workforce Development.

Innate continued to test a 0.1 mg/kg dose of lirilumab against placebo, but Monday's topline results dashed those remaining hopes.

""Although we knew that this setting was challenging, we are disappointed by the results of the EffiKIR study and will investigate further to better understand the data in its entirety,"" said Pierre Dodion, chief medical officer at Innate Pharma.

Lirilumab is designed to block interactions between killer-cell immunoglobulin-like receptors and their ligands, thereby activating natural killer cells to attack tumor cells.

Bristol-Myers recently paid Innate Pharma a $15 million milestone payment after interim Phase 1/2 results pairing lirilumab and Opdivo showed show promise against squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Bristol-Myers believes blocking KIR on natural killer cells and PD-1 receptors on T-cells could potentially enhance the benefit provided by Opdivo alone, especially in patients with high PD-L1 expression levels.

Other combo studies with lirilumab and various agents are ongoing across a range of cancer types. After Opdivo's surprising setback in first-line lung cancer last summer, many analysts and investors are paying more attention to Bristol-Myers' combination strategy, particularly with Opdivo and Yervoy (ipilimumab).

Criticism of rising drug prices has come from both sides of the aisle on Capitol Hill over the past several years. And pharma stocks took a hit in early January when President Trump accused the industry of ""getting away with murder.""

A recent sit down between Trump and some top pharma executives struck a more muted tone on pricing. But even so, pricing scrutiny looks set to continue unabated in 2017.

Klobuchar particularly keyed in on Kaleo's more than 500% price increase for Evzio.

""This price increase is worrisome. Due to the severity of the opioid epidemic and Evzio s life-saving attributes, it is critical that your products remain affordable to Americans.""

The Minnesota Senator asked Kaleo to explain its rationale for the price increase and detail how the cost of manufacturing has changed during that period   a political vulnerability even if most drug prices are not usually determined solely by cost of goods.

Public health advocates worry that dramatically rising naloxone prices will make opioid overdose treatments less accessible at a time when Americans are dying from opioid overdoses in record numbers. Such deaths totaled 33,000 in 2015, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).

And Kaleo's Evzio commands a not insignificant share of the retail naloxone market   nearly 20% according to estimates by the Food and Drug Administration for July 2015 through June 2016.

Klobuchar also asked for more information on the decision making behind the price of Auvi-Q, which Kaleo is launching nationwide on Feb. 14.

""Your price of $4,500 for a two-pack is especially disturbing, as more competition should mean lower   rather than higher   prices for epinephrine injectors,"" wrote Klobuchar in the letter, referencing Mylan's dominant EpiPen brand.

Last year, Mylan had been castigated for its $600 list price point for a two-pack of EpiPen, particularly since Mylan had a virtually monopoly. The entry of Kaleo's Auvi-Q changes that, but as Klobuchar points out, the system doesn't seem to benefit from the added competition.

 Klobuchar, like some of her Democratic colleagues, has been active in introducing legislation aimed at tackling rising drug costs.","Healthcare"

But competition from Novartis and Eli Lilly is looming as their respective drugs inch toward markets.

Winning over physicians in the U.S. and rolling out the drug in Europe will help build up Pfizer's first mover advantage in the drug class, Pfizer executives suggested on an investor call last month.

Ibrance is the first CDK 4/6 inhibitor to win approval in Europe, securing an okay for treatment of HR+, HER2- locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer last November.

In a statement on its decision, NICE noted data which showed Ibrance extended progression-free survival by an average of 10 months, but wanted to see more evidence on potential overall survival benefits.

""The committee needs more evidence of the drug s impact on overall survival of people with breast cancer,"" said Carole Longson, director of the Centre for Health Technology Assessment at NICE, ""However, even when allowing for these potential benefits, it was still not enough to make palbociclib cost effective at its current price.""

NICE's recommendation remains a draft version for now. Comments on the guidance are due Feb. 24 and a second appraisal committee meeting is set for Apr. 6. Pfizer could still negotiate an agreement with NICE to secure coverage for Ibrance.

Besides Pfizer, other groups were disappointed in the judgment.

""It is very disappointing that palbociclib is not being made available to patients, but cost is the limiting factor. If the manufacturer, NICE and NHS England can find a way of making this treatment available for patients, they will substantially improve the lives of patients with breast cancer,"" said Nicholas Turner, team leader in molecular oncology at the Institute of Cancer Research, a U.K.-based organization.","Healthcare"
"Amgen buoyed by Repatha success, earnings beat"," Repatha met its goal&nbsp;in a closely watched cardiovascular outcomes trial, potentially giving the slow-growing drug a competitive edge over rival Praluent.&nbsp; ","http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/amgen-repatha-earnings-cvot-cardiovascular/435460/","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 09:35:10 -0500","NA","Amgen buoyed by Repatha success, earnings beatOverall, Amgen beat consensus estimates for the fourth quarter amid higher product sales. Quarterly revenue was just under $6 billion, up 8% from the same period a year prior, mainly driven by higher sales of Enbrel (etanercept), Prolia (denosumab) and Kyprolis (carfilzomib), as well as Repatha.

CEO Robert Bradway said Amgen finished 2016 strong, pointing to the cardiovascular outcomes data as an important domino to help drive long-term growth.

""In terms of efficacy, the [Repatha] trial met its primary composite and secondary composite endpoints, and importantly in terms of safety, there were no new findings in the trial,"" Bradway said during the earnings call.

""This is obviously an important result for us and for the field as it clearly validates the outcomes benefit of PCSK9 inhibition in cardiovascular disease.""

The study evaluated whether Repatha reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. The drug, which has struggled to gain sales, met its primary composite endpoint (time to cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization).

Analysts at Jefferies said they view individual endpoints, such as time to cardiovascular death, as important in determining the drug s value.

Amgen has been battling rivals Sanofi and Regeneron, who market a competing PCSK9 drug called Praluent (alirocumab), in court, recently winning a surprise injunction on sales of Praluent in the U.S. Sanofi and Regeneron are appealing that verdict.

The positive FOURIER data, plus the injunction, could give Repatha the edge it needs to both beat out its competitor and win over payers, who have balked at the drug's cost.

Amgen also expects its biosimilars portfolio will be a long-term growth driver, Bradway said. The big biotech recently won U.S. approval for a copycat version of AbbVie's Humira (adalimumab), although patent litigation will likely keep the drug off the market for some time.

But Amgen is also vulnerable to biosimilar competition itself.

For 2017, Amgen said it expects flat revenue, partly due to the continued impact of competition against oncology drugs Neupogen and Epogen as well as biosimilar threats to flagging mainstay Neulasta.

Novartis markets a biosimilar version of Neupogen and recently won approval of   but hasn't launched   a copy of Amgen's main breadwinner Enbrel (etanercept).

The company expects competition to result in ""limited net selling price yield through 2017,"" in particular for Enbrel, management said.

Jefferies analysts said they expect declining sales from Amgen s legacy products to be largely offset by new products, though, such as Repatha, Prolia and biosimilars.","Healthcare"
"Biotech IPOs off to better start in 2017"," Rebound&nbsp;from a weaker 2016 performance, plus a newly minted Trump administration&nbsp;and investor optimism should support a more robust IPO market in 2017, but doubts remain. ","http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/IPO-market-2017-biotech-stock/435378/","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 08:00:00 -0500","NA","Biotech IPOs off to better start in 2017In the world of biopharma, a couple strong rounds of venture funding or a standout clinical candidate may spark the idea that a small startup has the goods to become a prominent player   and an initial public offering (IPO) could give it that last push, and capital, needed to get there.

The number of IPOs happening at any given time is often a litmus test for the industry. In abundance, they indicate a growing interest among investors for promising therapeutics, or a more relaxed regulatory environment that offers drugs hope of a quick trip to market. This was exemplified in 2014, when the healthcare industry saw 102 IPOs, 71 of which were biotechs, including Sage Therapeutics, Auspex Pharmaceuticals and Kite Pharma. Conversely, fewer IPOs indicate stagnant pipelines or a general lack of return on investment potential.

Three biotechs have gone public so far in 2017. They are AnaptysBio, Jounce Therapeutics and ObsEva SA, while industry followers anticipate a fourth, Visterra Inc., to price its stock and conduct an IPO any day now. Those few new-to-the-exchange companies represent an uptick from 2016, when the first pharmaceutical IPO didn't happen until early February.

AnaptysBio filed its S-1 form, which companies use to signal their intent to go public, with the Securities and Exchange Commission in mid-November. The San Diego-based company, which focuses on inflammation treatments, planned to issue 4 million shares of common stock at $15 a pop, but on Jan. 25 announced it would increase the shares doled out to 5 million, still at $15 per share.

As such, AnaptysBio picked up $75 million from its IPO. Shares began trading the next day at $16 each, and increased about 4% to $16.62 per share at market's close on Feb. 1.

ObsEva stock also began trading on Jan. 26. It opened at $13.29 per share, but had fallen to $11.30 by close-of-market Wednesday.

The Swiss creator of reproductive health drugs had first announced its decision to go public in late December. Almost a month later, the company revealed it would offer 6.45 million shares of common stock at a range of $14-$16 per share, and expected it would net $87 million. The company landed in the center of its range, though, garnering $15 per share and netting $97 million.

Jounce Therapeutics filed for IPO on Jan. 3. The cancer drug developer later priced the nearly 6.4 million shares it prepared to issue at $16 per share, which resulted in $102 million in new capital. The stock began trading at $18 per share on Jan. 27. As of Wednesday, shares had fallen about 5% to $17.09 since that initial date.

Expectations have Visterra going public before Feb. 5. Should that happen, it would cap off an IPO journey that has been on and off for more than a year. The Cambridge, MA-based company said it could raise up to $69 million through going public in a Jan. 3 filing with the SEC, but revised the amount down to around $50 million later that month. The company expects to offer 3.85 million shares of common stock priced between $12 and $14.

Another company to keep an eye on is Braeburn Pharmaceuticals. Like Visterra, Braeburn was scheduled to IPO this past week, selling about 7.7 million shares at $18-$21 per share and expecting to get a $150 million payout. But it pulled that IPO on Thursday due to the ""current market dynamic,"" according to a Reuters report.

Whether 2017 will continue to outpace its preceding year   which saw 42 healthcare IPOs in the U.S.   is difficult to guess.

Some think there is a strong case for a brighter future. Atlas Ventures partner Bruce Booth projects more than 30 life science IPOs, the bulk of which would come from biotechs, on just the NASDAQ exchange in 2017. The prediction stems from a large crop of already filed IPOs and drugs progressing through the pipeline. What's more, fourth quarter healthcare IPOs increased in number and volume compared to third quarter   with 35 deals, up more 67%, worth a combined $8.15 billion, according to a BioPharm Insight report   offering optimism that the trend may continue into the new year.

""Coming out of J.P. Morgan this year there was more optimism,"" EY Global Biotechnology Leader Glen Giovannetti  said in an interview. ""I don't think anyone was expecting generalist investors to plug back into the market and to see another year   like 2014 or something. But there was more optimism, and there were certainly many more companies lined up in the queue with confidential filings.""

Others were not convinced. TheStreet's Adam Feuerstein, for one, said a company like Moderna going public would be the only IPO to catch investors' eyes in 2017.

EY's Giovannetti also cautioned that the Trump Administration and its potential to remodel tax or regulatory rules adds a big scoop of ambiguity to the IPO market.

""Strong deals will get out just based on investor appetite for especially exciting technology areas or clinical trial data,"" Giovannetti said. ""But if you're going to have a much more robust market, you've got to get some interest from generalist-type investors. They're more risk sensitive to conversations about changes in drug pricing, for example, policy, those types of things.""","Healthcare"

As of January 2016, Twist had raised over $130 million in fundraising and has moved into commercialization.

But that success attracted attention from Leproust's former employer Agilent. In February 2016, Agilent accused Leproust stole proprietary gene manufacturing technology she had helped develop while working for Agilent for 13 years.

Agilent, a much larger global company, pointed towards Leproust's registration of a domain name for Twist while working at Agilent as evidence of her intent to capitalize on proprietary information.

"Prescribed Reading: A week dominated by politics and earnings"," Pharma's sit down with President Trump was a hot topic in earnings calls this week as markets tried to gauge&nbsp;the new administration's approach to the industry.&nbsp; ","http://www.biopharmadive.com/news/trump-pharma-earnings-pfizer-fda/435382/","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 05:00:00 -0500","NA","Prescribed Reading: A week dominated by politics and earningsBiopharma is a complex, rapidly evolving industry that is highly regulated and closely watched   and that means there is constant news. Here's a closer look at the clinical trials, M&A, cool science and regulations that are driving the industry this week.

Instead of deals, the second week of biopharma earnings was dominated by politics. Last week started off with President Donald Trump meeting with several executives from various industries including the CEO of Johnson & Johnson. That meeting was followed up this week by a sitdown with pharma leaders, including executives from Novartis, Amgen, Celgene, Eli Lilly and Merck & Co.

The gathering highlighted the President s desire to lower drug prices and bring pharma manufacturing back to the U.S.   both things that could cause challenges for the industry going forward. But Trump's tone was less critical than in previous comments where he accused pharma of ""getting away with murder.""

The assembled executives expressed interest in bringing jobs back to the U.S., with Amgen announcing it would 1,600 U.S. workers. But the industry has been steadily cutting jobs over the last several years as many pharmas restructure their pipelines. Some of those cuts have even come to U.S. workers in recent months.Lilly slashed 500 employees after the failure of its Alzheimer s med solanezumab, for example.

Overall, pharma appeared upbeat about relations with the new administration. Pfizer CEO Ian Read expressed his optimism about the meeting during the company s fourth quarter earnings call and noted that tax reform and reducing regulations could be positives for big pharma.

Novo Nordisk execs also called the meeting positive on a fourth quarter call, but said that U.S. political uncertainty would impact sales.

Talk of politics did not help a few smaller biotechs from hiding their bad trial results from investors as several stocks were hit this week after setbacks in the clinic.

Catabasis, for one, failed to meet its primary endpoint in a mid-stage study for its Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) drug edasalonexent.

Elsewhere, Cambridge-based gene therapy company Dimension Therapeutics lost half its market value when it announced its hemophilia B treatment showed some signs of increasing liver toxicity in a small early-stage study. The safety issue could derail this promising therapy before it gets started.

Tenax Therapeutics also hit a roadblock in its Phase 3 trial when its lead candidate levosimenda, a cardiovascular drug, failed to achieve statistical significance.

While Seres Therapeutics announced its trial failure last summer   a major blow to the up-and-coming area of the microbiome   the former darling announced this week it has met with the Food and Drug Administration and given the agency its conclusions about what could have contributed to the unexpected results.

On another political note, Trump signed an executive order this week that could have major implications for the Food and Drug Administration.

The order requires government agencies to knock out two older regulations for every new one that is enacted. Industry stakeholders believe there are some regulations the agency could remove without causing harm to drug safety and efficacy standards. Yet, its unclear at this point if the order encompasses all types of regulation, such as agency guidance documents.

Meanwhile, opponents believe a stripped down FDA could mean chaos for the industry.

In the meantime, the agency remains without a leader. Trump told executives during the meeting this week that he intends to announce his pick for the top FDA slot soon.","Healthcare"

"The Evolving Biopharma Contract-Manufacturing Market","Once biopharma companies optimize operations in order to free up hidden capacity, they have four options: build, acquire, partner or face the realities of outsourcing","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2017/the-evolving-biopharma-contract-manufacturing-market/","Tue, 31 Jan 2017 18:01:00 -0500","NA","The Evolving Biopharma Contract-Manufacturing MarketBiopharma companies have depended on contract manufacturing organizations (CMOs) to provide capacity and capabilities as needed; in some cases, CMOs have provided a great deal of a company s production. Yet the current market structure presents biopharmacos with a shortage of CMO capacity to produce biopharmaceuticals, especially in mammalian cell culture technology and new modalities, even as demand for outsourcing increases. As companies face today s evolving industry economics, they should first optimize their operations in order to free up hidden capacity. Once this is done, they have four remaining options: build, acquire, partner or face the realities of outsourcing.

WHY OUTSOURCE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS?

The large molecules that constitute biopharmaceuticals differ from small molecules not only in their size, but also in their behavior, their manufacture and the way they work in the human body. Manufacturing these molecules is significantly more complex than producing traditional pharmaceuticals.1 In fact, biopharma is a true high-tech industry, with complex processes that relatively few players have entirely mastered.

Perhaps as a result, the industry is more profitable than the pharmaceutical industry, with relatively little pressure on cost of goods sold (COGS). Biopharma has also grown steadily for a number of years, and the large pipeline of molecules in clinical trials promise continued growth.

Despite the industry s high complexity, however, outsourcing is extremely popular. In fact, the market share of biopharma CMOs has risen steadily in the past decade, reaching 20 to 30 percent of the industry s COGS in 2013, and is expected to grow to almost 70 percent for some companies over the next few years.2 Not surprisingly, global CMO sales are growing steadily, fed not only by increased outsourcing, but by overall growth in new and existing products including clinical-trial supply. Further growth of more than 5 percent per year is projected over the next three years, leading to a total biopharma CMO market of $7 billion in 2019   of which up to 30 percent will come from trial supplies.

Five factors are primarily driving this growth:

  Hedge risk: Biopharmaceutical companies often outsource to balance their risk and buy time until key milestones in clinical trials or market uptake are met and they can justify investing in-house.

  Lack of capacity: Many new market entrants. and start-ups developing biopharmaceuticals lack existing manufacturing capabilities. The same is true of some large pharma companies switching over parts of their pipeline to biopharma.

  Invest hurdles: The biopharma industry has high investment requirements. For example, a new biopharma plant with large stainless-steel vessels designed to produce high-volume biopharmaceuticals (500-1000 kg of active pharmaceutical ingredients, or APIs, a year) would require more than $250 million and lead times of four or more years.

  Lack of capabilities: Several experienced CMOs have strong technical capabilities in cell line development, process development and scale-up. These CMOs are very well-suited to production process development, able to increase yields while reducing COGS. In fact, a CMO s technical capabilities are one of the most important factors to consider when selecting an outsourcer, along with its track record of quality, compliance inspection and supply flexibility. Exhibit 1 illustrates one CMO s success in increasing yields, or titers, after optimizing the manufacturing process for a range of six products (monoclonal antibodies, or mAbs).

  Technology shift: Two major trends impact existing mammalian cell culture facilities:

1)The production of large molecules moves to highly productive platforms composed of cell expression, media composition and process mode in up-and downstream processing (fed-batch vs. continuous, rise of single-use equipment). Not all existing plants are ready for disruptive productivity increase or use of disposables.

2)New biologics modalities in the pipeline like multispecific mAbs, viral vectors, oligonucleotides, peptides and other force biopharma plants into a multi-platform, multi-modality situation while most multi-product plants are still in a mono-modality and mono-platform setup.

THE CHALLENGES OF BIOPHARMA OUTSOURCING

Transfer complexity

Looking at the market drivers and the value proposition offered by leading CMOs, the advantages of outsourcing from a biopharmaco s perspective seem clear. Yet biopharmaceutical outsourcing faces several challenges, one of the best-known   and most critical   is the molecules  high transfer complexity. All large, complex biopharmaceuticals (such as mAbs, receptors and enzymes) require extremely sensitive production conditions given their complex structure and unpredictable post-translational modifications. As a result, transferring this type of biopharmaceutical to a new production environment is extremely complicated   whether transferring from R&D to manufacturing, or from the originator company to a CMO. In fact, more than a hundred input parameters must be adjusted to accommodate the living biopharmaceutical organism and the purification of large complex proteins, because duplicating the original environment is next to impossible. If transfers fail into highly utilized CMOs, the next slot available might be several months later, having a huge impact on the launch forecast and impacting the top-line, as such it is clear that an excellent process transfer track record is a critical success factor.","Biotechnology"

"Inking the Deal","Mastering the art of lasting outsourcing relationships in the pharmaceutical industry","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2017/inking-the-deal/","Tue, 31 Jan 2017 15:57:00 -0500","NA","Inking the DealResponsible drug manufacturers and contract organizations share the common goal of producing the best possible product in the most efficient way. The two have shared mutually beneficial relationships for decades in the pharmaceutical industry and will no doubt continue to do so for years to come. The numbers support that continued success as well: according to an IntelliROI 2016 report, the global contract pharmaceutical manufacturing market is expected to reach $84 billion by 2020, up from $58 billion in 2014.

What follows is an in-depth look at pharma s outsourcing relationships from the contract manufacturing perspective   what works, what doesn t, and how to both build and maintain the optimum dynamic for ongoing success.

When trying to qualify the relationships between contract organizations and their customers, generalizations are ill-advised. Asked about the challenges and frustrations of their client relationships, the resounding response from CMOs was    it depends. 

Drug manufacturers have a broad range of outsourcing experience, and naturally some companies are better-versed in the process than others. Additionally, project complexity, scale, goals and timelines vary. However, in order for the process to run smoothly, it is pivotal that drug manufacturers do not lose sight of why they are outsourcing. Essentially, is the need functional or strategic or somewhere in between?

 I think it s important for our potential customers to keep in mind why they went to a CDMO in the first place,  says Mike Valazza, VP global business development, Catalent Pharma Solutions.  Was it speed or technical advancements or a specific delivery platform, for example. If they keep that in the forefront of their minds, they will find a partner that is a good fit. 

Project complexity can change the nature of relationships as well. Drug manufacturers who approach contract organizations with products that are easy to make, with well-characterized processes and well-defined systems naturally create a smoother, simpler relationship. But complex pharmaceutical products are becoming increasingly more common.

 These complex products require a much higher level and frequency of communications as the CMO works through the various challenges that will be confronted. There needs to be mutual trust and responsiveness from both parties to get these challenges resolved quickly and efficiently,  says Lonnie Barish, executive director, business development, Wellspring Pharma Services.

But just because the product is complex, does not mean the outsourcing relationship has to be complex, says Simon Edwards, VP global sales and business development, Cambrex.  The project may be complex, but relationships only get complicated by people. A good relationship is a bond based on the individuals who are involved. Where it gets complex is when there are people involved behind the scenes who aren t active in the day-to-day interactions. If all those working directly together respect one another and develop a degree of goodwill, there is a natural tendency to sort out problems,  says Edwards.

Much has been written about the role of contract manufacturers evolving from an  extra set of hands  to a more high-level, strategic partnership. But is the term  strategic partnership  truly the best way to describe the contract organization/drug manufacturer relationship? Again, the answer is: it depends.

 I don t like the term strategic partners. It s true that if it s going to work well, the relationship should be strategic in nature. But we are definitely not talking about a formal strategic partnership on paper   it is more strategic behavior as opposed to a strategic partnership. The strategic behavior comes out of the relationship you build, not out of formalizing a strategic partnership agreement,  says Edwards.

Tee Noland, CEO of Pharma Tech Industries, echoes that sentiment and is realistic about the varying nature of the relationship.

 The word  partnership  just gets thrown around a lot,  says Noland.  The reality of some of our relationships can be  you re the vendor and we are the customer,  which can make solving problems and communication challenging,  acknowledges Noland.

When drug manufacturers are content with working tactically   purchase order after purchase order   and aren t seeking a strategic relationship, savvy contract organizations adapt to the situation.

 We tune our execution protocol to suit individual client requirements. Some of our longest partnerships have been with clients where we demonstrated flexibility and commitment to fine tune our approach to meet their needs,  says Vivek Sharma, CEO of Piramal Pharma Solutions.

Perhaps it s a problem of logistics more so than semantics. It isn t necessarily the case that the entire pharmaceutical industry is opposed to significant, high-level relationships with their outsourcing partners   but getting there can be a struggle.

Supply chain optimization is at the forefront of today s pharmaceutical industry agenda, playing a key role in addressing current cost, performance and quality challenges. According to an A.T. Kearney Pharma Supply Chain Panel survey of pharmaceutical companies, the single biggest barrier to improving performance is supply chain complexity. And while 92 percent of respondents of that survey saw simplifying their supply chains as a strategic priority, nearly 40 percent of the surveyed firms were not yet doing anything about it.

 Many large pharma companies are in fact saying they want  strategic partnerships  with CMOs. They don t want to work with 150 CMOs, they just want the 50 best CMOs. But to get there is not an easy thing to do. There is a tremendous amount of time and complexity involved in shifting products in order to consolidate suppliers,  says Noland.

As drug manufacturers continue to pare down their vendor numbers and establish preferred/strategic partnerships with fewer, integrated suppliers, contract organizations are establishing competitive advantages by understanding the individual needs of each customer and maintaining a flexible approach to the relationship.

The contract services market has enjoyed healthy growth in recent years, no doubt a reflection of the robustness of pharmaceutical pipelines and the drug industry s overall greater need for support. In fact, Nice Insight s 2016 CDMO Outsourcing annual survey revealed that pharma/biopharma execs expect spending on outsourcing to increase for the fourth year in a row.

However, consolidation, increasing offshore outsourcing alternatives and pharma s tightening purse strings means that competition for outsourcing bids is alive and well   and pricing, like it or not, is a factor in contract services selection. But according to CMOs, it is not the leading factor in the process.

 I don t think price dominates   it s not necessarily the number one. Customers talk to at least 3-6 suppliers, and often kick out the highest and the lowest bid. If price was dominating, drug manufacturers would just pick the lowest bid,  points out Edwards.

So what is dominating the selection process? First and foremost, is a contract organization s quality reputation, followed closely by its ability to execute projects against promised timelines.

 Customers do look at your quality record and do try to get a feel for your technical expertise. I don t think I ve ever won any business where our customers haven t gone to look at our sites first,  says Edwards.

Sharma echoes this sentiment:  The degree of confidence that the CMO can provide to the customer on supplying the product on time, at the right quality, quite often directly correlates to the probability of winning the proposal. Of course, the CMO still needs to be within a certain range of the bids that the customer receives. 

Upon further dissection, the  price  discussion should really be a discussion of value   exactly what are drug manufacturers getting for their dollars spent?  At the end of the day, the least expensive car on the market isn t going to be a Mercedes, but if you are going to spend the money on a Mercedes, you are expecting that the value is there for what you are spending,  points out Valazza.

Contract organizations caution drug makers against chasing lower numbers. And the precautionary words are not merely self-indulgent: Lower initial prices could ultimately equate to bad service, bad quality and supply disruptions.

 It is up to the pharma companies to decide if they want a reliable supply chain   one where they are not constantly having to put out fires   or do they want to chase a lower cost and, as a result, have to micromanage their supply chain,  says Noland.

Scope creep   a challenge ubiquitous to all project management   needs to be taken into consideration during the initial price screening. Scope creep occurs when a project is not properly defined, controlled or documented, and deliverables and project boundaries are not properly laid out.

It s helpful to be aware that different contract organizations take different approaches to handling scope creep.  Some will come in with barebones project scope and then issue change orders as the project moves forward, while other companies will do more of a full-service proposal and lay out what they anticipate to be all the costs, preferring to minimize change orders,  explains Barish.

 It s not always the case that others are less expensive; sometimes they just scope less work,  agrees Valazza.

 What we do at Catalent is to anticipate the work the client will need based on all our experience and build that into the proposal. We try to be upfront with what we think would be the best way to run the program if we were the decision maker,  Valazza adds.

As drug manufacturers narrow down their choices of outsourcing partners, thorough due-diligence and drilling down to understand how the project is truly going to run ultimately helps inform the decision much more than just figures on a page.

A new manufacturing plant at Cambrex's facility in Charles City, Iowa. Contract organizations cannot stress enough the criticality of advanced planning. There is universal agreement that the clearer the vision for the project upfront, the smoother it will go down the road, and the opposite is equally true: poor planning will cost both sides time, money and frustration.

 One of the leading causes for tension in the CMO/ pharma relationship is lack of clarity and vision upfront,  says Barish.

Planning needs to come from both sides of the relationship.

 Ideally pharma companies lay out exactly what they want, what their regulatory strategy is and how they see the project rolling out. Companies that do not provide the basic info for developing a quotation   safety data on APIs or packaging info for example   create a back and forth as contract organizations struggle to get all of the needed information. And ultimately, pharma companies can regret decisions that were made early on that were not strategically thought out upfront and instead decided on the fly,  says Barish.

When expectations are clearly defined upfront, contract organizations can then provide the pharma manufacturer with a clearer understanding of full cost and timelines.

 In general, customers are prepared. It is even more helpful if they are clear on the difference between what they want and what they need. Often drug manufacturers are looking to get to the next step, but the bigger question is, what do you NEED to get there?  says Edwards.

A widely used tool for laying out such expectations is the Request for Proposals (RFP). The RFP document should effectively communicate the pharma organization s key deliverables and timelines in detail and ask questions specific to the proposed project.

 A well-written RFP and an effectively managed RFP process form the foundations for a productive relationship with the chosen CMO   a relationship that may last for the entire lifecycle of your product,  says Ron Herman, senior partner, NexGen Consulting Group. (For more on RFPs, see Herman s The Art of the Request for Proposals .)

RFPs mean all potential outsourcing partners see the same package, at the same time. While it standardizes the playing field, there can be downsides to the on-paper process.

 RFPs tend to take the relationships out of a lot of sourcing decisions. I worked with Bob on the last project and it went really well, but Bob is now replaced by a RFP committee. On the one hand, it s a way of doing things fairly, but it s also a bit of a loss because it removes the relationship from the initial equation,  says Edwards.

Ideally, drug manufacturers reach back out to CMOs after receiving proposals, seeking further clarification and asking questions about the proposal. The personal relationship element should, at this point, re-enter the picture.

While a carefully written and thought-out RFP can take the human element out of the equation,  on another level it clarifies the direction, and does a better job of setting expectations on both sides,  concludes Barish.

Each industry comes with its own unique set of challenges. Savvy contract organizations are well-versed in the struggles indicative of pharma and have established methods of working through these challenges.

One such challenge in the pharma industry is culture. As pharma s business models shift, its cultural models are failing to adjust accordingly. Frequent mergers, acquisitions, and relocations further complicate the matter. PwC went as far as to use the term  cultural sclerosis,  stating that  prevailing management culture, mental models and strategies on which the industry relies are the same ones it s traditionally relied on, even though they ve been eclipsed by new ways of doing business. 

Companies struggling to build a strong culture within their own organizations will invariably be challenged when trying to form working partnerships.

 You need to be sure of your own culture before you can find a cultural fit with an outsourcing partner,  says Noland.

But this struggle has helped some contract organizations to reflect inward and work to improve their own cultures. A poor cultural fit can result in awkward CMO-drug manufacturer relationships, which means CMOs also need to have a clear vision of their own capabilities.

 Our reputation is paramount to us. If I take on a program that isn t a good fit culturally and the customer has a bad experience, it can affect our ability to work with that customer on other programs in the future,  says Valazza.

Pharma Tech speaks of the time spent building their own cultural focus.  To get the culture we believe is in the shared interests of our employees and our customers, we ve had to invest a lot in our cost structure in terms of the right leadership. To grow, we need a certain level of volume and profitability to sustain the culture we want,  says Noland.

Contract organizations can be challenged to take such a position, as the core reason for outsourcing has traditionally been lower costs   meaning CMOs have to exercise some frugality, at least at the start, and need to reach a certain scale before investing heavily in top talent. But the investments seemingly pay off, as contract organizations with strong cultures and values are able to provide structure and consistency to their customer relationships.

There is much variability involved in pharmaceutical outsourcing relationships and tremendous pressure surrounding these relationships.

 In our industry, time is money. Delaying the launch of a product can result in the loss of tens of thousands, sometimes millions of dollars. We, as CMOs, are constantly being reminded of that fact,  says Barish.

Building a good outsourcing relationship is the responsibility of both parties, and the best relationships have these three things in common: communication, flexibility and planning.

 Every project and customer is a learning experience. It s a complex business to be in. The pace and challenges in the pharma world can be eye-opening,  concludes Noland.

For two sectors that rely on each other for industry success, mastering the art of building and maintaining relationships is proving to be worth it.","Biotechnology"

For example, the FDA says it is now making it easier and faster for health care professionals and patients to get the most up-to-date drug safety information on the more than 18,000 drugs available on its website. Its improved Drug Safety Labeling Changes Program, now managed by CDER s Office of Communications, enables the agency to post the latest safety information about a medicine almost at the same time they approve a change, as opposed to once a month, says Mary E. Kremzner, U.S. Public Health Service, in an FDA Voice blog post.

When a physician or other health care professional prescribes a patient s medicine using an e-prescribing system, the new safety information now displays much faster. Within days of FDA approval of new drug safety information for a drug product, the information is entered into the safety labeling changes database. Health IT vendors that provide clinical and drug information support for hospitals and pharmacies are then alerted to integrate the safety labeling changes data into their systems, Kremzner says. Instead of waiting weeks for the monthly release of all safety labeling updates, this information is now accessible in days.



The public can access the information as well, now in a searchable database. Keying in the drug name yields a comprehensive listing of the labeling changes related to safety for that product.

 Our new program is a game-changer for health care professionals seeking to provide the best quality care for their patients,  Kremzner says.

THE MUTUAL RELIANCE INITIATIVE

Another way the FDA is responding more quickly is through the Mutual Reliance Initiative (MRI). 

In order to address concerns surrounding the rapid increase in imported drugs from nations where the FDA devotes limited inspection resources, the FDA created an expanded inspectorate. Thus,  investigators and inspectors from FDA and trusted partners, such as those in the European Union, would work together, rely on each other s inspections, avoid duplicating inspections, and conduct more inspections in areas where the increase in drug manufacturing has greatly increased, like in China and India,  says Dara Corrigan, J.D., FDA s associate commissioner for global regulatory policy, in FDA Voice.



To meet that challenge, FDA responded with the Mutual Reliance Initiative. The concept is simple, Corrigan explains,  EU country inspectors inspect in their respective countries, FDA inspects the manufacturing facilities in the United States, and the EU and FDA would rely upon each other. This would avoid duplication, lower costs and enable the regulators to devote more resources to other parts of the world where there is greater risk. The savings would be considerable   over the last five years, about 40 percent of FDA s drug inspections were performed in the EU. 

The MRI was actually launched in May 2014, when FDA and EU assembled dedicated teams to assess the risk and benefits of entering into a mutual recognition agreement. FDA was invited to observe the EU s Joint Audit Program, in which two EU nations audit the inspectorate   the regulatory authority   of another member. FDA first observed the audit of Sweden s inspectorate by auditors from the United Kingdom and Norway. Since then, FDA has observed an additional 12 audits of drug inspectorates across the EU with more audit observations planned through 2017, Corrigan says.

In addition, the FDA hopes to sign an agreement with the EU soon and is working to complete assessments of the capability of the drug manufacturing inspectorates of two to four countries within the EU. These first steps with the EU will lead toward FDA s goal of an expanded inspectorate, containing investigators and inspectors from FDA and across the EU.  These collaborations will enhance our ability to evaluate risk, produce better data, and minimize public health risk globally,  Corrigan said.

"Electronic Batch Records: Improving Compliance, Accelerating Time to Market","An electronic batch record solution that is integrated with enterprise information systems improves compliance and streamlines the creation of batch records so products can be delivered to market more quickly","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2017/electronic-batch-records-improving-compliance-accelerating-time-to-market/","Thu, 26 Jan 2017 21:59:00 -0500","NA","Electronic Batch Records: Improving Compliance, Accelerating Time to MarketThe pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have been bound by strict regulations for a long time. In fact, few other industries must contend with such high levels of control, transparency and traceability. In pharmaceutical manufacturing, these high levels of compliance and quality are necessary to sustain business and uphold patient safety and confidence.

As part of those regulations, authorities require that records be kept of each batch of product that a company produces. The information held in batch records can be accessed during assessments and is used to confirm that the appropriate procedures are followed, material inventory is controlled, operators  identities and training levels are verified, and the necessary quality checks are performed. It is also used to assess the effectiveness of continuing product improvement strategies and initiatives. For many companies, capturing this information is a challenging and imperfect manual process. Manufacturers that have successfully deployed information technology to improve efficiency in other domains have traditionally found batch record reporting difficult to automate.

As the power of computing has grown, software has evolved, the cost of digital storage space has shrunk, and the ingenuity of people in connecting information systems and databases has improved. Modern electronic batch record solutions are coming to market that can integrate with other enterprise systems to enable much better control over the capture and analysis of batch data.

Why do most pharmaceutical manufacturers still use manual, paper-based processes to create batch records? The most likely answer is the simplicity of the solution. It s easy to walk around a manufacturing facility with a pen and paper. This doesn t require a lot of expensive equipment or complicated IT initiatives. Operators simply read values from dials and meters on production equipment or dispensing lot labels and fill in the values on a printed form on a clipboard.

Unfortunately, every step in a manual process is inefficient and at risk for error. This is significant for batch record documents, which tend to be very large and complex. Operators may incorrectly transcribe a reading, neglect to complete a required field or forget to include mandatory signatures or initials for an entry. Crucial attachments such as sample analysis can be delayed or lost. The entire paper record itself is subject to damage.

A lengthy verification process is necessary before the documentation can be approved to permit release of the batch. This can lead to batches of perfectly good product sitting in a warehouse waiting for the paperwork to catch up, which can take weeks. During that downtime, the cost of storage space accrues, delivery to market is delayed and time elapses on product expiration dates.

An electronic batch record system makes use of various databases that hold the data recorded during manufacture of a batch and a business process engine that defines the process to be followed. A user interface presents the necessary set of tasks and instructions to operators. This allows them to monitor activities and record applicable results. Integration among systems enables an electronic batch record system to be continually updated with information about environmental monitoring, test procedure execution, resource planning, manufacturing execution, product lifecycle and other knowledge about enterprise processes. This information becomes part of the batch record. Automated capture of this data reduces risk of error and is therefore more compliant with industry guidelines.

An integrated solution improves compliance and streamlines the creation of batch records so products can be delivered to market more quickly. It also provides a source for key data required for the annual product quality reviews that regulatory authorities require from manufacturers to confirm that processes are under control and that products are continually improved.

Completing these mandatory reviews is a demanding task that often leaves professionals scrambling for answers. How many batches did we make? What were the yields? Where were the deviations? What changes did we make? Were those changes effective? What happened on average across these products? For many companies, the reporting required to answer such questions can take a long time because the necessary information is spread across multiple disparate databases   or more usually in disparate stores of paper records.

An electronic batch record solution that is integrated with enterprise information systems can unite related data to automate analysis across the product development and manufacturing continuum. This can alleviate many inadequacies of paper-based batch reporting and free up professionals to devote their expertise to more valuable tasks.

Validity of master documents is at risk if users copy and print paper batch master templates from previous jobs. An electronic batch records system can provide a formally approved batch master document with a standardized structure. Companies have the ability to change the configuration of that structure for their particular needs, and details will be relevant for the specific product that is being produced.

Because users authenticate their identity when they log on to the system, manual signatures are no longer required and operator training level and competency are easy to trace. An electronic system eliminates the need for operators to introduce paper, pens and clipboards into cleanrooms, reducing potential for contamination from dust and cross-contamination from other batches. Operators can scan barcodes on equipment and raw material labels or enter data directly on computers and tablets. The underlying database can validate the responses and automatically react (raise a deviation) if recorded results are out of the expected range.

An integrated system can monitor manufacturing activity in real time, watching for trends and events over several batches of a product and checking for anything out of specification. If something goes wrong, the system can automatically send alerts so adjustments can be made before an entire batch goes out of spec, and a deviation can be automatically identified, addressed and documented as it happens.

An electronic system allows appropriate users access to a single view of the truth. The copy cannot be lost and the system audits all changes. It is easier to identify what information is missing from batch records (and who it was allocated to) so it can be quickly located and included. This not only makes the process more accurate, but also allows operators to react to deviations more quickly and accelerates the overall process.

An electronic batch record solution that is integrated with an enterprise information system can unite related data to improve compliance and streamline processes across the product development and manufacturing continuum. Deploying and integrating an automated batch records system can be a complex and far-reaching change to the business that requires significant focus and effort. Rarely does a pharmaceutical manufacturing facility spring into existence with all new integrated equipment from a single technology provider. In reality, companies have investments in various legacy systems that still function perfectly well for their specified tasks, but may be difficult to connect to other technology solutions.

Islands of automation and silos of data may be scattered across the enterprise in multiple disparate systems including manufacturing execution systems (MES), enterprise resource planning (ERP), product lifecycle management (PLM) and environmental monitoring systems (EMS). Because these components of the IT infrastructure are not connected, people write information down on paper and move it using manual data entry. Such inefficient practices compromise data integrity.

To optimize batch record reporting, integration is necessary between the batch record system and other enterprise information systems. Pharmaceutical manufacturers need to think of all data generated as part of the continuous workflow and not as discrete silos. As such, companies should consider adopting a paradigm that focuses on the organizational workflow as a whole, based on a central system of record.

When an ERP system sends a request for materials, integration with the batch record system should ensure that it can only use formally approved master forms. Integration with laboratory systems adds further compliance and efficiency benefits. For example, an EMS supports the execution of procedures and sampling plans to test for possible contamination of the production environment with microorganisms. Through integration, any resulting data and documents from EMS can be managed through the batch records system. Information from MES, PLM and other systems can be brought into the unified workflow as well.

When companies evaluate batch record technology, they should consider solutions that have a configurable business process engine. That enables the database for the electronic batch record system to be integrated with databases from various other systems to support the free flow of information throughout the enterprise.

Companies should seek a technology provider that can not only supply the system but that also has a professional services team for system deployment that can work with internal database administrators and IT team members. To ensure a successful integration process, the project team must understand other enterprise systems and the variety of data formats those systems generate. The team should have experience in deploying complex solutions in a validated environment.

The more paper and manual processes a pharmaceutical manufacturer uses, the more sources of potential error, and more checking must be done to confirm accuracy. This is challenging from a compliance perspective and a process perspective. Deploying an electronic batch record system and integrating it with other enterprise systems can reduce risk, improve data integrity and streamline processes. Such a deployment may represent a significant investment of time and resources. But once it is in place, automatic transfer of data through a validated interface can accelerate time to market in an efficient and compliant manner.

"Medical News Today: Is licorice intake during pregnancy linked to ADHD in offspring?","Researchers have associated high licorice intake in pregnancy with the development of poorer memory and ADHD-like behaviors in offspring.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315685.php","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 08:00:00 PST","Pregnancy / Obstetrics","Is licorice intake during pregnancy linked to ADHD in offspring?Study co-author Katri R ikk nen, from the University of Helsinki in Finland, and colleagues hypothesize that glycyrrhizin (the active ingredient in licorice) may interfere with fetal neurodevelopment by increasing levels of ""the stress hormone"" cortisol.

The researchers recently reported their findings in the American Journal of Epidemiology.

Though licorice is often hailed for its medicinal benefits - such as the alleviation of peptic ulcers and canker sores - studies have indicated that the plant-derived product has some downsides.

A study reported by Medical News Today in November, for example, associated licorice intake with reduced fertility for women, and studies have also suggested that licorice consumption during pregnancy may lead to poorer birth outcomes, such as a lower birth weight.

For this latest study, R ikk nen and team investigated how licorice intake during pregnancy might influence cognitive functioning and behavior in offspring.

The researchers explain that licorice's active ingredient, glycyrrhizin, is a strong inhibitor of placental 11 -hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 2 (11 HSD2), which is an enzyme known to block the production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol.

As such, glycyrrhizin may increase glucocorticoid production, and research has suggested that prenatal exposure to excess glucocorticoids is associated with psychiatric illness.

To test this theory, R ikk nen and colleagues analyzed the data of 378 children, aged 13 on average, who were born in Helsinki, Finland, in 1998.

Data on the glycyrrhizin intake of the children's mothers during pregnancy were gathered. Low intake was defined as under 249 milligrams of glycyrrhizin per week, and high intake was defined as more than 500 milligrams of glycyrrhizin - the equivalent of around 250 grams of licorice.

The team used the Child Behavior Checklist to assess the presence of psychiatric problems among the children, and neuropsychological tests were used to evaluate their cognitive function.

Compared with children born to mothers who had a low intake of glycyrrhizin during pregnancy, those born to mothers with a high intake of glycyrrhizin showed poorer performance in memory tests.

Furthermore, children of mothers who consumed large amounts of glycyrrhizin during pregnancy were more likely to have behaviors associated with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).

Additionally, the researchers found that girls started puberty earlier if their mothers consumed high amounts of glycyrrhizin while pregnant.

Although further studies are needed in order to determine the precise mechanisms by which maternal glycyrrhizin intake might impact the cognition and behavior of offspring, the team speculates that glycyrrhizin blocks 11 HSD2, leading to an increase in cortisol - the so-called stress hormone. This can cause harm to the developing fetus.

Commenting on what their findings indicate, the researchers say that:

The team adds that expectant mothers should be warned about the possible harms of consuming products containing glycyrrhizin.

"Medical News Today: 'Helper cells' can turn toxic in brain injury and diseases","Astrocytes induced by central nervous system injury and disease normally help repair damage.

The researchers suggest that the findings could lead to new treatments for brain injuries and major neurological disorders such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease.

Lead author Dr. Shane Liddelow, of the department of pharmacology and therapeutics at Melbourne, and the department of neurobiology at Stanford, says that while astrocytes have often been described as ""helper"" cells, it has also been shown that they can become toxic and contribute to the damage caused by brain injury and disease by killing other brain cells.

""These apparently opposing effects have been a puzzle for some time. By characterizing two types of astrocytes this paper provides some answers to the puzzle,"" he adds.

For a long time, scientists believed that astrocytes - star-shaped cells in the central nervous system that outnumbers neurons by around five to one - were simply packing cells that provide structural support to neurons.

More recently, it has become clear that astrocytes perform a wide variety of complex and essential roles in the brain and the rest of the central nervous system.

For example, it is now known that astrocytes enhance neuron survival and help to shape brain circuitry.

It is also known that astrocytes can change from benign ""resting astrocytes"" into ""reactive astrocytes"" with altered features, following brain trauma, infection, stroke, and disease.

However, what is not so clear is whether reactive astrocytes are good or bad.

In their study paper, the team describes finding a subtype of reactive astrocytes, which they call A1, that occurs in disease and injury.

A1 astrocytes appear to lose the ability to help neurons survive and grow connections. Instead, they induce the death of neurons and oligodendrocytes, the cells that help to grow the myelin sheath that insulates connections between neurons.

In further experiments, the researchers showed that blocking A1 astrocytes stopped them killing neurons.

The researchers also found that A1 astrocytes are abundant in various human neurodegenerative diseases, including: Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, Alzheimer's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and multiple sclerosis.

For example, in tissue samples from Alzheimer's patients, they found that nearly 60 percent of the astrocytes in the prefrontal cortex, a region of the brain where the disease causes the most damage, were A1 astrocytes.

Senior author Ben Barres, professor of neurobiology, developmental biology, and neurology and neurological sciences at Stanford, says that their study shows that astrocytes ""aren't always the good guys,"" and concludes that:

Learn about the symptoms of fibromyalgia and tips for avoiding flare-ups.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315646.php","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 06:00:00 PST","Fibromyalgia","Fibromyalgia Flares: Warning Signs and TreatmentsFibromyalgia is a long-term condition that causes pain and tenderness throughout the body.

Scientists estimate that around 5 million adults in the United States are affected by fibromyalgia. Although men and children can have the disorder, it is more often seen in women. Most people with the condition are diagnosed during middle age.

When fibromyalgia pains flare up, every activity can seem more difficult. All people experience flares differently, and there can be different triggers depending on the person.

Some people with fibromyalgia may experience certain symptoms on a regular basis. However, the pain associated with fibromyalgia tends to fluctuate and worsen. When symptoms temporarily increase in number or intensity, it is called a flare or flare-up.

Flare-ups can happen without warning and are mostly likely to occur if a person with fibromyalgia is stressed or under a lot of pressure. A flare can last anywhere from a few days to weeks at a time.

Certain factors may trigger a fibromyalgia flare-up, such as changes in:

Stressful events, surgery, or accidents can make fibromyalgia symptoms worse. Flare-ups can also be caused by a lack of sleep or doing too much or too little exercise.

The main symptom of fibromyalgia is widespread pain. The condition causes pain, stiffness, and tenderness of the muscles, tendons, and joints. The individual symptoms differ from one person to another. Symptoms can vary in intensity and come and go.

Someone with fibromyalgia may sometimes experience clumsiness, dizzy spells, feeling too hot or cold, painful periods, restless legs syndrome, and numbness or tingling in hands and feet.

Daily pain and sleep prevention can cause problems at home and work. The stress of coping with a condition can also lead to anxiety and depression.

Although some triggers for fibromyalgia are beyond a person's control, others can be managed and flare-ups prevented. It is often easier to prevent a flare than treat one.

Below are several lifestyle changes and tips that may help relieve symptoms and make fibromyalgia easier to live with day to day.

Triggers for fibromyalgia vary from person to person. Maintaining a log of activities, meals, sleep times and duration, and symptoms of fibromyalgia may help to identify particular triggers.

Recording these activities might highlight patterns of what triggers a flare. This might help a person with fibromyalgia find out how to better manage or avoid those triggers.

Stress makes symptoms of fibromyalgia worse. Many people with fibromyalgia experience stress and feelings of depression, anxiety, and frustration. People may benefit from trying to avoid or limit exposure to stressful situations and making time to relax.

While techniques such as meditation or deep breathing may help manage stress, it is important that people with fibromyalgia do not avoid physical activity altogether. People with fibromyalgia who quit work or stop exercising do not do as well as those that stay active.

Options to assist with stress management are available and include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), group therapy, and feedback from qualified health professionals.

Fatigue is one of the main symptoms of fibromyalgia. It is essential that a person with fibromyalgia get enough sleep.

Sleep hygiene practices that may help include going to bed and getting up at the same time every day and limiting napping during the day.

Sometimes, people with fibromyalgia experience restless legs syndrome and pain that can interfere with sleep. A doctor can recommend treatments for these problems, which may aid restful sleep.

Regular physical activity can often decrease or improve symptoms of fibromyalgia. Although exercise may increase symptoms of pain at first, it may help prevent pain over time.

Activities that are recommended for people with fibromyalgia include walking, biking, swimming, and water aerobics. Maintaining good posture habits, stretching, and relaxation exercises may also help.

For maximum effect, it is recommended that people with fibromyalgia begin with gentle exercise, such as walking, and build up endurance and intensity slowly.

Resistance and strengthening exercises may improve muscle strength, physical disability, depression, and quality of life. They can also improve tiredness, function, and boost mood in people with fibromyalgia.

While regular physical activity is recommended to help manage fibromyalgia symptoms, it is crucial to limit overexertion not to do too much.

Moderation is the key. If a person with fibromyalgia does too much on days where their symptoms are good, they may end up having more bad days. However, on those bad days individuals should still try to be as active as they can. Keeping activity levels as even as possible provides the best outcome.

Although there is no specific diet recommended for people with fibromyalgia, there are certain foods that appear to make fibromyalgia symptoms worse.

Maintaining proper nutrition will help boost energy levels and help avoid other health problems.

Treating fibromyalgia flares can be tricky. Preventing a flare developing in the first place is less complicated than treating a flare.

Fibromyalgia has several symptoms, which means that no one treatment will fix them all. Also, a treatment that works for one person may not work for another.

Various treatments in different combinations may have to be tried before someone finds a plan that works for them. The treatment plan will often be a blend of medication and lifestyle changes.

Medications that may help reduce fibromyalgia pain and improve sleep include:

Talking therapies such as CBT aim to alter the way a person thinks about things and may help tackle fibromyalgia in a more positive way. Psychotherapy can also help someone with fibromyalgia help understand and deal with their thoughts and feelings.

There is little evidence to show that alternative treatments such as acupuncture, massage, and aromatherapy help with fibromyalgia. However, these methods might help with relaxation and stress.

There is no cure for fibromyalgia. However, medication and lifestyle changes can help treat fibromyalgia and reduce the likelihood of flares. Fibromyalgia is a condition that can be managed and people with the disorder can live a full life.

Participating in regular exercise is one of the most effective ways that fibromyalgia flares can be avoided and pain can be managed.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Fibromyalgia and Itching: Causes and Treatment","How does fibromyalgia relate to itching and is itching mentioned in the diagnosis criteria? What may cause the itching and which treatments will help?","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315652.php","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Fibromyalgia","Fibromyalgia and Itching: Causes and TreatmentFibromyalgia is a disorder that causes widespread pain. One of the rare symptoms or side effects that may be linked to fibromyalgia is itching. So what is the connection between the two?

Fibromyalgia is thought to affect about 5 million Americans aged 18 years and over. The most common symptoms of fibromyalgia include extensive pain, extreme fatigue, and sleep disturbance.

Less common symptoms of fibromyalgia include hand and foot tingling, headaches, feeling irritable, frequent urination at night, and irritable bowel syndrome.

Itching is not often mentioned as a symptom or side effect of fibromyalgia because it is relatively rare.

In one study looking at the frequency of skin-related issues in people with fibromyalgia, itching with no identified cause was reported by 3.3 percent of individuals.

Other skin problems that were reported by people with fibromyalgia included:

People with fibromyalgia are more sensitive to pain, sensation, and touch than those without the disorder. As a result, any of the above skin problems may feel prickly or itchy to someone with fibromyalgia.

The American College of Rheumatology provide criteria for diagnosing fibromyalgia.

The criteria advise that pain and symptoms would need to have been felt in the past week in at least 7 out of 19 body areas. The number of areas that pain is felt is scored between 0-19 and referred to as the person's Widespread Pain Index (WPI) score.

After determining the WPI score, the next step is to work out how severe symptoms are with a Symptom Severity (SS) score. In part one of the SS score, levels of fatigue, waking unrefreshed, and changes in thinking must be rated between 0-3, with 0 rated as having no problem and 3 as severe.

In part two of the SS score, other symptoms that have been experienced in the past week should be checked. One of these many symptoms includes itching.

A doctor will calculate the score from the WPI and total SS in order to work out if the person has fibromyalgia. All symptoms would have to have lasted for at least 3 months at a similar level and not be explained by another condition.

The cause of itching for people with fibromyalgia is not clear. However, the following may play a part.

The central nervous system is made up of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. The central nervous system communicates information all around the body through a network of nerve cells

Scientists think that people with fibromyalgia experience changes in the way that the central nervous system processes their pain messages. These changes may develop because of abnormal levels of certain chemicals in the brain that signal pain, called neurotransmitters.

Researchers also believe that the pain receptors in the brain can develop a muscle memory of the pain. This can cause them to become more sensitive and overreact to pain signals.

Itching may occur in fibromyalgia due to certain nerve fibers being activated and causing an itching sensation. Itching and pain share a common pathway positioned in the spinal cord. Pain and itchiness also activate the same sensory brain areas. Someone who is sensitive to pain may also be sensitive to itchiness.

Constant itching may set off a ""scratch-itch cycle."" Initially, scratching relieves the itch, but with constant scratching the skin becomes damaged. This makes the itching worse, so the person scratches more and itches more.

People with fibromyalgia have abnormal levels of the neurotransmitters dopamine, noradrenaline, and serotonin in the brain. Neurotransmitters are chemical messengers that control communication throughout the brain and body.

Research examining serotonin's role in the skin found that abnormal levels of serotonin cause mice to itch. Researchers also found that when serotonin is released in response to pain, certain receptors are activated that cause itchiness.

Scratching the itch causes the release of serotonin as a pain reliever, which activates the receptors again and causes more itching.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), such as sertraline and fluoxetine, may help to reduce skin itching.

Medications that are used to treat fibromyalgia, including pain relievers, antidepressants, and anti-seizure drugs, can sometimes have side effects of itching in certain people. These medications include:

If itching is experienced with fibromyalgia medications, people should check with a doctor to ensure that the symptoms are not an allergic reaction. In some cases of itching, the dosage or medication may need to be altered.

There are no guidelines on how to treat itching in fibromyalgia. However, once the cause of an itch is identified, it can be treated.

Reducing pain symptoms can treat itching activated by pain in fibromyalgia. Medications to treat fibromyalgia pain include:

If one of these medications causes itching, a doctor can recommend an alternative dosage or medication.

To treat itching that is caused by the scratch-itch cycle from damaged skin, the following measures may provide relief:

Persistent itching can interfere with sleep, and a lack of sleep could worsen symptoms of fibromyalgia. Continued scratching may also result in infection.

If a person with fibromyalgia is experiencing persistent itching, they should check their symptoms with a doctor.

Itching linked with fibromyalgia is rare. However, it can be an uncomfortable and irritating problem for those who do experience it.

Depending on the cause of the itch, many methods can be used to relieve symptoms, treat itching, and aim to eliminate the cause. While several self-care measures can be applied at home, it is always best to ask the advice of a doctor if someone has fibromyalgia and is also experiencing itching.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Using NSAIDs during a cold may increase heart attack risk","Taking NSAIDs during acute respiratory infections such as a cold or flu may increase the risk of heart attack, new research finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315658.php","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Cardiovascular / Cardiology","Using NSAIDs during a cold may increase heart attack riskStudy co-author Dr. Cheng-Chung Fang, of the National Taiwan University Hospital, and colleagues recently reported their findings in The Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are medications that help to alleviate pain by reducing inflammation.

Ibuprofen and aspirin are examples of two commonly used NSAIDs, and many individuals use these medications to help relieve some of the symptoms of a cold, flu, and other acute respiratory infections (ARIs), such as fever and headache.

According to Dr. Fang and colleagues, previous research has suggested a link between the use of NSAIDs, ARIs, and an increased risk of heart attack.

However, the team notes that there have been no studies assessing whether NSAID use during ARI episodes is associated with a greater heart attack risk.

To investigate, the researchers used data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Program to pinpoint 9,793 patients who had been hospitalized for a heart attack between 2007 and 2011.

The researchers assessed the risk of heart attack among patients in four different scenarios: during an ARI, during NSAID use, NSAID use during an ARI, and no exposure to NSAIDs or an ARI.

NSAID use alone was associated with a 1.5 times greater risk of heart attack, compared with no ARI or NSAID use, while an ARI alone increased the risk of heart attack by 2.7 times.

The risk of heart attack was greatest when patients used NSAIDs during an ARI, at 3.4 times higher. When NSAIDs were delivered intravenously in hospital during an ARI, the risk of heart attack was 7.2 times higher.

These findings are purely observational, so they cannot prove that NSAID use during ARI episodes directly increases the risk of heart attack.

However, the researchers recommend that doctors and patients apply caution when considering the use of NSAIDs for the relief of ARI symptoms.

Dr. Fang adds that medications that alleviate pain in a different way to NSAIDs (such as acetaminophen) may be safer alternatives during ARIs.

The team recommends that future studies investigate which NSAIDs are safest to use during an ARI. They should also assess how the severity of ARIs influences the risk of heart attack with NSAID use, and whether some patients are more susceptible to increased heart attack risk than others.

"Medical News Today: Childhood cancer treatment may hinder later-life sexual relationships","Researchers have found that high-intensity neurotoxic cancer treatment in childhood may lead to psychosexual impairment later in life.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315668.php","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Cancer / Oncology","Childhood cancer treatment may hinder later-life sexual relationshipsStudy co-author Vicky Lehmann, Ph.D., of Nationwide Children's Hospital and Ohio State University - both in Columbus, OH - and colleagues found that adults who received high-intensity neurotoxic treatment for cancer as a child were less likely to meet certain sexual and romantic milestones.

However, the team found that childhood cancer treatment did not affect overall satisfaction for sexual and romantic relationships in adulthood.

Lehmann and team recently reported their findings in the journal Cancer.

According to the American Cancer Society, it is estimated that around 10,380 children aged 15 and under were diagnosed with cancer in the United States last year.

Leukemia is the most common form of childhood cancer, accounting for around 30 percent of all cases, followed by brain and spinal cord tumors, which make up around 26 percent of all childhood cancer cases.

While cancer was responsible for more than 1,200 childhood deaths last year, over 80 percent of children diagnosed with the disease will survive for at least 5 years. This is due to significant advances in cancer treatment, which include surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy.

However, such treatment is certainly not without risk. For example, studies have shown that cranial radiation - often used to treat brain tumors - may cause harm to the developing brain, leading to long-term neurocognitive impairment.

Previous research has shown that neurocognitive impairment as a result of childhood cancer treatment may impact social interaction in adulthood, but studies investigating the effects of such treatment on psychosexual development are few and far between.

To address this gap in research, the team enrolled 144 survivors of childhood cancer aged between 20 and 40. A further 144 participants who were not treated for childhood cancer (the controls) were matched by age and sex.

All participants completed questionnaires on psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction.

To determine the brain toxicity of cancer treatments in childhood, the researchers used data from the participants' medical charts.

Overall, the team found that adults who were treated for cancer in childhood did not differ significantly from the controls in terms of psychosexual development, sexual satisfaction, and relationship satisfaction.

However, on analyzing subgroups of childhood cancer survivors, the researchers found that those who previously received treatments high in neurotoxicity were less likely to have had sexual intercourse, be in a relationship, or have had children, compared with controls.

The type of cancer treatment in childhood did not appear to affect sexual satisfaction, the team reports. ""This highlights the subjective nature of psychosexual issues, and the importance of addressing any concerns in survivorship care,"" notes Lehmann.

The researchers say that their findings indicate that the neurotoxicity of cancer treatment in childhood may predict the likelihood of psychosexual problems in adulthood. They add:

"Medical News Today: Symptoms and Signs of MS in Women","Learn about the symptoms of multiple sclerosis that are specific to women. What are the causes and possible risk factors of MS for women?","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315639.php","Sun, 05 Feb 2017 06:00:00 PST","Multiple Sclerosis","Symptoms and Signs of MS in WomenMultiple sclerosis is an autoimmune neurological condition that affects the central nervous system and which is potentially disabling.

The immune system attacks the myelin coating that protects nerve fibers. This disturbs communication between the brain and the rest of the body, and this eventually damages the nerves.

Multiple sclerosis (MS) affects women more often than men. The condition can also cause specific symptoms and problems in women that men do not experience.

MS is most frequently diagnosed in women between the ages of 20 and 40. While women can experience many of the same symptoms that men do, the condition can also have specific effects on menstruation, contraception, pregnancy, and menopause.

A woman's body temperature rises before and during a period, and this can affect the symptoms of MS. Women with MS tend to feel worse during this time, and symptoms such as fatigue, depression, balance, and weakness can be more problematic.

Some MS medications, such as antidepressants and beta interferons, can also affect the menstrual cycle. They may cause ""spotting"" or irregular periods, although these side effects often improve with time.

Some women opt for reducing or stopping their periods through the use of hormone-based contraceptives.

Fertility is not affected by MS. Women with MS can generally choose to use any of the various available methods of contraception.

When choosing a contraceptive, it is important to take into account the type of MS medication being used and its interaction, if any, with the contraceptive of choice.

Many women with MS experience difficulties relating to arousal, response, and orgasm during sex. There is no available treatment for this, but there are things that can help.

Most women who have MS are diagnosed at a time when they may be thinking about starting a family. It was previously believed that pregnancy could have a negative effect on MS, but now there is evidence that the relapse rate is reduced during pregnancy. The reasons for this are thought to be hormone-related.

It is possible that relapses may increase after birth, when hormones go back to their previous levels. However, research suggests that pregnancy has no effect on the long-term progression of MS.

A woman with MS is equally as likely to have a healthy pregnancy as a woman without MS.

With careful planning, it is perfectly possible for a woman with MS to have a baby.

Because some MS medications are unsafe during pregnancy, it is usually advised to stop treatment and wait 3 months before trying to get pregnant. This needs to be done in strict consultation with a specialist as it can be harmful to suddenly stop taking some medications.

Doctors will look at the risks posed to the mother and the baby when advising on whether or not to continue taking medication.

These MS symptoms can be aggravated during pregnancy:

During menopause, some MS symptoms, including fatigue and bladder problems, can be made worse. As with pregnancy, hormone levels also change during menopause.

A recent study looking at the impact of menopause on MS, found that, after menopause, when the body stops producing estrogen, the level of disability increases at a faster rate. HRT may help delay this in women with MS as a result, by increasing estrogen levels in the body.

Hormone replacement therapies can be used by women with MS in tablet form, patches, gels, or implants.

The signs and symptoms of MS are varied, depending on the level of damage and the nerves that are affected.

It is not known why MS develops in some people and not in others. It appears to be due to a mixture of genetics and environmental factors.

Some of the risk factors that can increase the chances of someone developing MS are:

The condition is most common in countries such as Canada, the Northern United States, New Zealand, South-Eastern Australia, and Europe.

Although there are no MS-specific tests, a diagnosis is often made by ruling out other conditions with similar signs and symptoms.

A thorough neurological exam and medical history are required to diagnose MS. The following tests are also used to help do this:

While there is no cure for MS, there are treatments that can help with symptom management and help those affected to recover faster from attacks. Some people with very mild symptoms do not require any form of treatment.

When using disease-modifying therapies, it is important for people to choose the right one. Doing so will depend on many factors, such as how long the disease has been present, whether other MS treatments have been effective, and whether having children is a consideration.

There is some evidence to suggest that a number of these therapies may help to relieve some of the symptoms of MS:","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Brain Tumor: Types, Symptoms, and Treatment","In this article, learn about the different types of brain tumor and associated risk factors. What different treatment options are available?","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315625.php","Sun, 05 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Cancer / Oncology","Brain Tumor: Types, Symptoms, and TreatmentA brain tumor is a mass or growth of abnormal cells within the brain or spinal cord. A brain tumor can be dangerous as it can disrupt the proper function of the brain.

Brain tumors are often referred to as cancerous (malignant) or noncancerous (benign). Tumors can also be primary or secondary.

Brain tumors are often classed as benign or malignant.

Doctors may also refer to a tumor based on where the tumor cells originated. If the tumor began in the brain, it can be referred to as a primary brain tumor. If it began in another part of the body and spread to the brain, it can be referred to as a secondary, or metastatic, brain tumor.

On May 9 2016, the World Health Organization officially reclassified all of the types of brain tumor. There are now over 120 types of brain tumors.

The American Brain Tumor Association (ABTA) estimate that there will be more than 79,000 new cases of primary brain tumors diagnosed in the United States in 2017. However, they have estimated that around one third of these will be malignant.

ABTA also estimate that there are currently around 700,000 people living with primary brain tumors in the U.S. According to ABTA, an estimated 16,700 people will die from brain and spinal cord tumors in 2017.

Symptoms of brain tumors may vary depending on the type of tumor and its location. The following symptoms may occur slowly and gradually increase, but they may also come quickly in the form of a seizure.

Despite the symptoms listed above, some people may have experienced no symptoms at all when their brain tumor is discovered.

According to the American Cancer Society (ACS), around half of people with brain tumors get persistent headaches. The ACS also state that around half of people with brain tumors suffer a seizure at some point.

A doctor may carry out a neurological exam. This is a test of the nervous system, and the doctor will look for problems that are caused by brain tumors. These include:

After these tests, a doctor may then schedule further exams, including:

If a doctor suspects that someone has a brain tumor, the person will probably undergo a biopsy. This is a surgical procedure where a piece of the tumor is removed and sent to a lab for tests. The tests aim to identify whether or not a patient has a brain tumor.

The cause of most brain tumors is not fully understood. According to the ACS, most brain tumors are not actually linked to any known risk factor.

The only known environmental risk factor for brain tumors is exposure to radiation. This tends to be through radiation therapy.

According to the ACS, most people with brain tumors do not have a family history of the disease. However, there are some specific and rare cases where brain tumors have run in the family.

There are a number of factors that doctors consider when deciding on how to treat brain tumors. A person's medical team will work closely with them to inform them of their options, allowing the person to choose the best treatment.

Factors that will be considered when deciding on how to treat a brain tumor include:

Here are some of the most common treatment methods for brain tumors:

Surgery is usually the first method of treatment for brain tumors. The surgeon will aim to remove as much of the tumor as possible. They will aim to do so without damaging any of the brain tissue that surrounds the tumor.

The surgeon may not be able to remove the entire tumor. If this is the case, they may use surgery to remove as much of it as possible before using radiation or chemotherapy to remove the rest. Surgery may also be used to provide a tumor sample, enabling a doctor to find an accurate diagnosis.

A doctor may prescribe steroids to a person with a brain tumor. These steroids are designed to reduce the buildup of swelling around a tumor and can also temporarily decrease symptoms. They can also make a person with a brain tumor generally feel better.

Steroids aren't designed to reduce a tumor's size, but they can have a toxic effect on certain tumor cells in particular types of brain tumor.

Radiotherapy is designed to destroy a brain tumor or prevent its growth. Beams of intense energy are administered to the brain from an external source. It aims to destroy the tumor cells, which causes the tumor to shrink in size. The destroyed tumor cells are then dealt with by the person's immune system.

The issue with radiotherapy is that radiation cannot distinguish between tumorous cells and healthy cells. If administered, it can damage both sets of cells.

Radiosurgery is the common name for stereotactic radio surgery (SRS). SRS is a special form of radiation therapy and is not considered surgery.

SRS allows a doctor to administer a precise dose of radiation in the form of an X-ray beam. They can focus the radiation only on the area of the brain where the tumor is present. This reduces the risk of damage to the healthy part of the person's brain.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Visual evidence shows brain 'resetting' during sleep","Images from sleep research show how the brain resets during sleep. Synapses grow with daytime stimulation and shrink by nearly 20 percent during sleep.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315664.php","Sun, 05 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Neurology / Neuroscience","Visual evidence shows brain 'resetting' during sleepScientists at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health conducted a 4-year study that demonstrates the ""synaptic homeostasis hypothesis"" (SHY) functioning.

Results of the study were published in the journal Science.

SHY is a theory proposed by Dr. Chiara Cirelli and Dr. Giulio Tononi, both of the Wisconsin Center for Sleep and Consciousness. Cirelli and Tononi speculate that sleep is the price we must pay for brains that are pliable and able to learn new things repeatedly.

Constant stimulation of the synapse during wakeful hours results in it growing stronger and larger, and it is thought that this expansion plays a key role in memory and learning. To ensure that the synapse does not become saturated and neural signaling and memories obliterated, SHY indicates that this growth must be counterbalanced.

Sleep is thought to be the perfect counterbalance and ideal time for the process of renormalization. During sleep, people are less aware of the ""here and now"" and can block out the external world, which may balance and restore the synapse.

As synapses become stronger and more efficient they get bigger. In contrast, as they weaken, the synapses shrink in size.

Cirelli and Tononi aimed to test their theory by analyzing whether the size of the synapses alters between sleeping and waking hours.

Analysis involved 4 years of research and many specialists. The team used technology with high spatial resolution (called serial scanning 3-D electron microscopy) to photograph, reconstruct, and investigate two areas of cerebral cortex in the brain of a mouse. The technology allowed them to reconstruct 6,920 synapses and take measurements of their size.

The team was unaware of whether the mouse they were examining was a well-rested mouse or a mouse that had been awake, in order to ensure that the results were not influenced.

Findings of the research show that the size of the synapses correlated with the amount of sleep the mouse had had previous to the image being captured. A few hours of sleep were found to reduce the size of the synapses by 18 percent in both areas of the cerebral cortex. The changes were also confirmed to be proportional to the synapses' size.

While the scaling took place in around 80 percent of the synapses, the scaling was selective and the largest synapses did not follow the same pattern. Scaling may not have happened in the larger synapses since they might be linked with the most stable memory traces.

""Extrapolating from mice to humans, our findings mean that every night trillions of synapses in our cortex could get slimmer by nearly 20 percent,"" concludes Tononi.

"Medical News Today: Oyxtocin-like hormone from insects could prevent preterm labor","Researchers managed to isolate a hormone from the black garden ant, replicate it synthetically, and test its effect on uterine contractions.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315679.php","Sun, 05 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Pregnancy / Obstetrics","Oyxtocin-like hormone from insects could prevent preterm laborOxytocin plays a crucial role in emotional bonding - whether it is between romantic partners, parents and children, or even owners and their pets.

The ""love hormone"" is naturally released in our body when we make love or make new friends. But apart from its role in social bonding and reproduction, oxytocin also helps mothers give birth.

Oxytocin stimulates powerful contractions during labor, helping the cervix to open up in preparation for delivery. This is why it is often used as a drug to aid birth.

Vasopressin also plays an important role during birth. The hormone is believed to have analgesic effects, as during natural delivery its levels increase extremely sharply.

A new study - led by researchers from the Medical University of Vienna in Austria - examines how the two hormones work in both insects and humans. The research also explores the therapeutic effect of a synthetic equivalent of the two hormones.

The study was published in the journal Scientific Reports.

The team of international researchers - led by Christian Gruber from the Institute of Pharmacology at Medical University of Vienna - set out to isolate a neuropeptide from ants that is structurally very similar to oxytocin and vasopressin.

Neuropeptides are one of the two major classes of neurotransmitters, and both vasopressin and oxytocin are neuropeptides.

Insects also have neuropeptides, and Gruber and team isolated one called inotocin - which is the equivalent of vasopressin and oxytocin in arthropods.

Researchers then created a synthetic equivalent of inotocin, which enabled them to better understand how the biochemical signaling process of oxytocin and vasopressin works.

Vasopressin typically controls the water balance through the kidneys, but in combination with oxytocin, it regulates the blood supply to the uterus during childbirth. Like oxytocin, vasopressin also stimulates contractions during delivery.

So far, medical scientists have identified four brain receptors that respond to the two neuropeptides: one oxytocin receptor (OTR) and three vasopressin receptors (VR) - VR1a, VR1b, and VR2.

Then, using a unique strategy for the discovery of ligands, researchers isolated inotocin from the black garden ant, cloned its cognate receptor, and examined its pharmacological effect on both the insect and the human OTRs and VRs.

Ligands are ""any atom or molecule attached to a central atom"" in a complex chemical compound.

In humans, researchers found that inotocin activated the V1b receptor, but inhibited the V1a. Then, Gruber and team tested the inotocin ligand on human uterine tissue, and found that it successfully inhibited muscular contractions.

""Surprisingly, by introducing a small chemical modification into this insect neuropeptide, we were able to develop a very stable and highly selective inhibitor of the human vasopressin V1a receptor,"" explains Gruber. ""This ligand was tested on human uterine tissue and effectively inhibited muscular contractions. Further tests are now necessary to explore clinical applications of the active lead molecule.""

The research used a unique strategy that took advantage of millions of years of evolution, to which we owe the structural similarities between humans and insects.

""In a parallel study, by analyzing genetic data sets, we have now been able to show that many insects have an oxytocin or vasopressin-like signaling system, and it is presumably functionally related throughout the animal kingdom,"" explains Gruber.

Specifically, the oxytocin-vasopressin signaling system has been around for approximately 600 million years, and being able to compare their receptors at a molecular level may enable scientists to develop new drugs and therapies.

For instance, an oxytocin-vasopressin receptor inhibitor could prevent unwanted uterine contractions in preterm labor.

Learn about what the symptoms are and what is suggested to try to prevent COPD.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315611.php","Sat, 04 Feb 2017 06:00:00 PST","COPD","Exacerbation of COPD: Causes, Warning Signs, and TreatmentChronic obstructive pulmonary disease is a group of diseases that cause airflow blockage and extreme breathing problems to the point of breathlessness.

Most commonly referred to as COPD, the term describes emphysema and chronic bronchitis. COPD also includes bronchiectasis and, in some patients, asthma. COPD gets worse as it progresses and, in late stages, a person may experience extreme breathlessness at all times, even when they are sitting still. COPD often goes undiagnosed and can be life-threatening if not properly treated.

An acute exacerbation of COPD refers to a flare-up or episode where a person's breathing becomes worse than normal. This can lead to life-threatening complications depending on the cause and severity.

In most cases, a COPD exacerbation can be linked directly to an infection within the lungs or the body. The infection is typically the result of a virus but can also be caused by bacteria or other organisms.

The infection causes inflammation within the lungs, which leads to narrowing of the airways. The airways become blocked due to swelling and mucus production.

Exacerbations can also occur as the result of a severe allergy or from inhaling irritating substances from the environment, including heavy air pollution. Other causes include:

In some cases, the exact cause is unknown.

Exacerbations can come on quickly and sometimes with little warning. Typical tests such as chest X-rays and blood tests are often unable to detect the severity of an exacerbation, so understanding the early signs are important. It is important for patients to be aware of even slight changes in their typical symptoms.

People with COPD are their own best defense against exacerbations. By understanding the signs and symptoms, they can get help right away to limit complications of a flare.

The signs and symptoms of exacerbations are related to the change from a person's usual condition. These include:

Exacerbations can be severe and life-threatening. At the first sign of symptoms, a person should seek immediate medical care. Depending on the severity and cause, patients will often require hospitalization. Sometimes exacerbations can be managed at home, depending on a person's overall health.

The frequency of COPD exacerbations can vary depending on the person, and a variety of conditions contribute to exacerbations. A 2014 report in PLOS One showed that patients who were older, female, had poorer lung function, had a history of exacerbations in the previous year, and who had a frequent cough with phlegm were more likely to have to have one or more exacerbations the following year.

People who experience recurrent exacerbations have a faster decline in lung function and increase their mortality risk, especially if they have to be hospitalized. Those who experience a mild flare-up will be prescribed medication at home.

Exacerbations need to be treated right away because it can take a while for someone to recover from them. Episodes caused by respiratory infections can result in increased mucus production, inflammation, and loss of lung function. Those who have a viral illness are at an increased risk for developing a secondary bacterial infection.

Outside of treatment for the flu, there are no medications that can slow a viral lung infection once it starts. Not all COPD exacerbations can be prevented, especially in the advanced stages of COPD. However, there are things that individuals can do to try to limit their occurrence and severity.

Quitting smoking is the most important thing any person with lung disease can do to improve their medical condition and quality of life. Enrolling in a smoking cessation program can help a person who cannot quit on their own.

Other things that can help prevent exacerbations include:

It is important that people with COPD understand the dangers their condition poses and have a home management plan in place. Depending on their age, severity of their COPD, frequency of exacerbations, as well as other medical conditions, some people must be hospitalized.

Signs of increased severity include worsening breathing, fluid buildup in the lower legs, chest pain, no improvement of symptoms with home medications, and mental confusion. Any of these symptoms require immediate medical attention.

For people who can be managed at home, there should be clear instructions about the use of medication and treatment therapy, as well as when to call the doctor. Some people may be prescribed supplemental oxygen therapy, which can also be used at home.

Tobacco smoke, including secondhand smoke, is the primary cause of COPD. The disease typically progresses faster in those who are exposed.

Shortness of breath is one of the most common problems that COPD patients have, but there are typically other symptoms. These can include:

Lung function in COPD is typically classified from mild to very severe. One way to check the severity of the disease is to measure airflow limitation.

People with stage 1 COPD have the best lung function while those in stage 4 have the worst. All COPD patients are at risk, but those with the most severe airflow limitations are the least tolerant to COPD exacerbations.

Exacerbations are major setbacks for people with COPD. Understanding the risk factors and recognizing the symptoms may mean that a person can get the treatment they need before their situation becomes life-threatening. Although people in the later stages of COPD may need to go to the hospital, those people with less severe exacerbations may be able to manage at home.

People with COPD and their caregivers should work alongside their doctor and medical team to ensure that everyone understands what should be done when exacerbations occur.

The key to preventing or lowering the risk of exacerbations is understanding the risk factors, knowing the signs and symptoms, and having an action plan in place.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Hammer Toe: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","What is hammer toe? In this article, learn about the risk factors for complications, when to see a doctor, prevention, and the long-term outlook.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315600.php","Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Bones / Orthopedics","Hammer Toe: Causes, Symptoms, and TreatmentHammer toe is the most common deformity of the second, third, or fourth toe. It is often caused by wearing narrow shoes with little to no arch support. The condition can be extremely painful but there are many treatments available to ease the pain.

A hammer toe is a toe that has an abnormal bend in its middle joint, making the toe bend downward to look like a hammer. Hammer toe affects the second, third, or fourth toes.

This painful condition forms due to an imbalance in the surrounding muscles, tendons, or ligaments that normally keep the toe straight.

Hammer toes are flexible to begin with. If hammer toe is not treated promptly, they may become fixed and require surgery to correct them.

Hammer toe occurs from an imbalance in the muscles surrounding the middle toe joint. These muscles, tendons, and ligaments work together to bend and straighten the toes.

If one of the muscles weakens, it will not be able to bend or straighten the toe. If the toe stays bent long enough, the muscles tighten and the toe will not be able to straighten out.

These muscle weaknesses and imbalances are caused by a variety of factors. Because some of the causes for hammer toe are avoidable, it is possible to minimize risk of developing hammer toe.

Causes of hammer toe include the following:

Due to footwear styles, women are more likely than men to develop hammer toe. The risk of hammer toe also rises with age.

The symptoms of hammer toe are often very visible. The affected toe will be bent, looking like a hammer.

A doctor normally diagnoses hammer toe during an exam. The doctor may gently move the foot and toe to cause symptoms to occur. This helps the doctor to thoroughly evaluate the condition of the toe.

Hammer toe is often very obvious in a foot exam. However, a doctor may order X-rays of the foot to further examine the bone structure of the affected foot.

Hammer toes are progressive, worsening over time. If not promptly treated, the toe joint may become fixed and require surgery to straighten it.

The more a person with hammer toe wears improper footwear and the longer the person ignores the developing hammer toe, the more likely the toe will require surgery to release the tendons.

While not a medical emergency, hammer toe does worsen over time. It is necessary for people to see a doctor promptly after noticing any symptoms of hammer toe or other foot issues.

People being treated for hammer toe should also check with a doctor if they notice that the condition worsens or does not get better with prescribed treatments.

In very rare circumstances, a patient with hammer toe may develop sores on the top of the middle joint of the affected toe. These sores may become infected. If there is any sign of infection, including pus, redness in the skin around the sore, or fever, a doctor should be seen.

If hammer toe is caught early enough, it can be managed with some lifestyle changes and exercises.

If the hammer toe is treated while the toe is still flexible, a doctor may recommend the following:

If the hammer toe cannot be moved, a doctor may recommend surgery for the toe. The surgery will release the tight tendons and muscles so that the toe can straighten again.

Hammer toe, like many other foot problems, can be avoided with wearing proper footwear. Proper footwear should have the following:

Hammer toe can be treated and prevented with simple exercises and footwear changes. However, if the toe becomes rigid, surgery may be needed to relieve the hammer toe.

Even after treatment, hammer toe may return. The best way to make sure that hammer toe does not reoccur is through choosing proper footwear.","Pharmaceuticals"

America is a nation of pet lovers. According to The Humane Society of the United States, around 66.5 million households in the U.S. own at least one pet, with dogs and cats being the most popular animals.

For many people, a pet is a considered a significant part of the family, often providing unconditional loyalty and companionship. Furthermore, studies have shown that pets can have a positive effect on mental health, helping to alleviate stress, anxiety, and depression.

According to Cassels and team, however, the majority of studies investigating pet-human relationships and their psychological impact have been conducted in adults. For their study, the researchers wanted to gain a better understanding of children's relationships with pets.

""We wanted to know how strong these relationships are with pets relative to other close family ties. Ultimately this may enable us to understand how animals contribute to healthy child development.""

The researchers came to their findings by surveying 77 children, aged 12, who had at least one sibling and one family pet.

The team used the Network of Relationships Inventory (NRI) to measure the relationship quality between the children and their siblings, as well as between the children and their family pets.

The NRI is a 30-item survey that assesses the presence of positive and negative features in relationships, including conflict, companionship, and emotional support.

Children reported having less conflict with their pets than with their siblings, the findings revealed, and they also reported greater satisfaction from the relationship with their pets.

""Even though pets may not fully understand or respond verbally, the level of disclosure to pets was no less than to siblings,"" says Cassels. ""The fact that pets cannot understand or talk back may even be a benefit as it means they are completely nonjudgmental.""

Contrary to previous studies, the team also found that girls have stronger relationships with their pets than boys do.

""While boys and girls were equally satisfied with their pets, girls reported more disclosure, companionship, and conflict with their pet than did boys, perhaps indicating that girls may interact with their pets in more nuanced ways,"" notes Cassels.

Companionship and satisfaction were greatest between children and dogs, compared with children who had other animals as family pets.

While further studies are needed to fully understand the relationships between children and pets, the researchers believe that their study has provided some insight.

"Medical News Today: How are calluses and throat cancer related?","New research examines the link between calluses and cancer of the esophagus, in a condition called 'tylosis with esophageal cancer.'","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315669.php","Sat, 04 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Dermatology","How are calluses and throat cancer related?Calluses form naturally as a result of putting too much pressure on the skin or subjecting it to excessive friction. The thickening of the top layer of the skin is the body's way of protecting the skin underneath.

For some people, however, calluses can become so severe that the hardened skin needs to be removed with a razor. The American Podiatric Medical Association recommend that people with diabetes or circulatory problems have their feet checked because in their case, calluses can lead to more serious problems.

New research, from the Queen Mary University of London in the United Kingdom, examines the link between keratin (the protein found in the outer layers of the skin, which plays a key role in forming calluses) and a form of esophageal cancer called ""tylosis.""

Tylosis affects more than 8,000 people in the U.K. It causes severe thickening of the skin in the hands and feet, and it has been associated with an esophageal cancer risk of over 95 percent. As a result, medical professionals refer to the condition as tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC).

In the United States, esophageal cancer ranks as the eleventh leading cause of death, as almost 16,000 people are estimated to have died from the disease in 2016.

Previous research has investigated the link between tylosis, calluses, and esophageal cancer, but this new study focuses on a particular gene found to play a crucial role in thickening the skin.

The study was published in the journal Nature Communications, and it was led by authors Thiviyani Maruthappu and Anissa Chikh.

Researchers used genetically modified mice to study the iRHOM2 gene.

A group of mice had the iRHOM2 gene removed, and these mice developed a much thinner epidermis on their paws, compared with mice that still had the gene.

As the authors explain, K16 is a cytoskeletal scaffolding protein that can be found in abundance at the pressure-bearing points in the footpad of mammals.

Researchers also examined K16 levels in humans with TOC, and they found a similarly heightened expression of the protein. This suggests that the iRHOM2 gene helps to regulate K16 in both humans and mice.

To the authors' knowledge, this is the first time that iRHOM2 has been identified as a regulator of K16 in humans and mice. This is also the first study to demonstrate that iRHOM2 binds to K16, and that this interaction increases in TOC patients.

Additionally, the research shows that the iRHOM2-K16 interaction also downregulates the expression of K6 - a keratin that typically binds together with K16.

""These findings highlight a novel and fundamental role for iRHOM2 in regulating the epithelial response to mechanical write the authors.

They also highlight the potential implications of their findings for understanding other skin conditions, such as psoriasis and skin cancer. Maruthappu and colleagues conclude:

"Medical News Today: Preterm delivery puts women at risk of cardiovascular disease","A new study investigates the link between giving birth prematurely and the mother's risk of developing cardiovascular disease later in life.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315656.php","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 09:00:00 PST","Heart Disease","Preterm delivery puts women at risk of cardiovascular diseasePreterm births occur when a baby is born earlier than 37 weeks into the pregnancy. According to the latest statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), premature births affect approximately 1 in 10 babies in the United States.

Most of these babies are at a serious risk of developing disabilities or even dying, as the brain goes through crucial developments in the final weeks of the pregnancy. Additionally, the final weeks are crucial for the full development of vital organs, such as the lungs and liver.

Mothers who do not carry births to term may also be at risk of illness. Previous research has linked preterm births to cardiovascular risk later in life, but it has been unclear whether lifestyle factors leading up to the pregnancy, or pre-existing cardiovascular risk factors, have influenced this association.

New research, published in Circulation, the journal of the American Heart Association (AHA), investigates whether the previously documented risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains after adjusting for lifestyle and CVD factors before the pregnancy.

The research was led by Dr. Janet Rich-Edwards, director of developmental epidemiology at the Connors Center for Women's Health and Gender Biology at Brigham and Women's Hospital (BWH) in Boston, MA.

Researchers analyzed existing data on 70,182 women from the Nurses' Health Study 2 - one of the largest ongoing studies into the risk factors for major chronic diseases in women.

They analyzed the link between premature births and CVD, and adjusted for factors such as the mother's age, education, and lifestyle before the pregnancy, as well as CVD risk factors.

The study revealed that preterm delivery correlated with a 40 percent higher risk of developing CVD compared with women who gave birth at term, and the risk increased for women who had more than one preterm delivery. Women who delivered earlier than 32 weeks had double the risk of developing CVD.

The increased risk remained even when the preterm deliveries were not complicated by high blood pressure disorders during pregnancy.

According to AHA, women already have a risk of dying from CVD of 33 percent. This number rises to 36 percent for those who give birth 3 to 7 weeks before term, and rises to as high as 60 percent for mothers who deliver 8 or more weeks early.

Dr. Rich-Edwards and team hope that their research will help to identify women at a particularly high risk of CVD, and enable professionals to take appropriate preventive measures.

""Delivering a preterm infant may be an early warning signal of high risk for cardiovascular disease,"" adds Lauren Tanz, first author of the study and a programmer and analyst at BWH. ""Since cardiovascular risk develops over a lifetime, it is not too early for these women to adopt a heart-healthy lifestyle.""

"Medical News Today: Multiple sclerosis: 'Resetting' immune system may achieve long-term remission","A small clinical trial reveals that over two thirds of patients with multiple sclerosis have been in remission for 5 years after stem cell transplantation.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315654.php","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 08:00:00 PST","Multiple Sclerosis","Multiple sclerosis: 'Resetting' immune system may achieve long-term remissionStudy co-author Dr. Richard Nash - of the Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and the Presbyterian-St. Luke's Hospital in Denver, CO - and colleagues recently reported the final results of their phase II trial (called HALT-MS) in the journal Neurology.

Relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS) is the most common form of multiple sclerosis (MS), accounting for around 85 percent of all diagnoses.

MS is a disease whereby the immune system mistakingly attacks myelin - the fatty substance that protects nerve fibers in the central nervous system - and the underlying nerve fibers. This interferes with signaling between the brain and spinal cord.

This disruption can cause muscle weakness and stiffness, problems with walking and balance, and chronic pain. People with MS may also experience fatigue, dizziness, cognitive deficits, and vision problems.

In RRMS, patients experience inflammatory attacks on myelin and the nerve fibers - referred to as ""relapses"" - and symptoms of MS arise. These relapses are followed by periods of complete or partial remission, whereby some or all of the symptoms disappear.

There is no cure for RRMS, but there are a number of medications that can help patients to manage relapses and symptoms.

However, the results of the new study suggest that one-time high-dose immunosuppressive therapy (HDIT), followed by autologous hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), may lead to long-term remission for patients with RRMS.

The goal of HDIT/HCT is to remove all MS-causing cells from the body.

The therapy involves collecting a patient's blood-forming stem cells, before treating them with high-dose chemotherapy to destroy their immune system. The blood-forming stem cells are then returned to the patient, effectively ""resetting"" their immune system.

In 2014, Dr. Nash and colleagues reported the 3-year results of their phase II clinical trial for HDIT/HCT. The trial involved 24 patients with RRMS aged between 26 and 52. All patients were using currently available medications for their condition, but none were experiencing a reduction in relapses or disease progression.

For the trial - funded by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID) - each patient received HDIT/HCT. The team found that almost 80 percent of patients experienced no relapses, worsening of disability, or new brain lesions in the 3 years following treatment.

In the new study, the researchers assessed the same group of patients 5 years after HDIT/HCT. They found that 69 percent of patients had still not experienced relapses, disability progression, or new brain lesions since the treatment.

Importantly, none of the patients had used any RRMS medications since treatment with HDIT/HCT.

Reported side effects of HDIT/HCT included cytopenias (a reduction in blood cells) and infections. Three patients died during the 5-year follow-up, but the researchers say that their deaths were not related to their treatment.

While further studies are needed to better determine the safety and efficacy of HDIT/HCT for the treatment of RRMS, Dr. Nash and team are encouraged by the results so far.

The thyroid is a gland in the middle of the lower neck. Although only small, it produces hormones that reach every cell, organ, and tissue to help control metabolism - the rate at which the body makes energy from nutrients and oxygen.

Thyroid diseases are common conditions in which the gland is either overactive and produces too much hormone (hyperthyroidism), or underactive and produces too little (hypothyroidism).

It is thought that around 20 million people in the United States are living with some form of thyroid disease, the causes of which are largely unknown.

Most thyroid disorders are chronic or life-long conditions that can be managed with medical attention. However, approximately 60 percent of cases are undiagnosed.

Undiagnosed thyroid diseases can lead to serious conditions, such as cardiovascular diseases, infertility, and osteoporosis.

Stem cells are cells that have the potential to mature into many different cell types. Particular patterns of genetic switches and signals direct the maturing stem cells toward their individual fates.

In their study, the researchers found a way to coax genetically modified embryonic stem cells from mice to develop into thyroid cells.

They discovered that there is a ""window of opportunity"" for doing this efficiently that occurs during cell development.

As they guided the laboratory-cultured embryonic stem cells through various stages of development, the researchers switched a gene called Nkx2-1 on and off for short periods.

They discovered a small timeframe during which the Nkx2-1 gene is switched on that converts the majority of the stem cells into thyroid cells.

Researchers believe that the discovery is the first step toward an effective human stem cell protocol for creating research models and new treatments for thyroid diseases. The principle may also apply to other cell types, they add.

In their paper, they note that stem cells hold great promise as a way to mass produce differentiated cells for research. However, a major roadblock to achieving high yields has been ""the poor or variable differentiation efficiency of many differentiation protocols.""

"Medical News Today: Acid Reflux in Infants: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","How is acid reflux in infants diagnosed and what are the possible risk factors to be aware of? Can any lifestyle changes help? Do babies outgrow reflux?","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315590.php","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 06:00:00 PST","Acid Reflux / GERD","Acid Reflux in Infants: Causes, Symptoms, and TreatmentMost infants ""spit up"" milk as part of their daily activities. The action of spitting up milk is known as reflux or gastroesophageal reflux. Reflux is perfectly normal, common in infants, and is rarely serious.

Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) happens when the contents of the stomach wash back into the baby's food pipe. It is defined as reflux without trouble, and usually resolves itself.

Sometimes, a more severe and long-lasting form of gastroesophageal reflux called gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) can cause infant reflux.

There is a muscle at the lower end of the food pipe called the lower esophageal sphincter. This muscle relaxes to let food into the stomach and contracts to stop food and acid passing back up into the food pipe.

If the muscle does not entirely close, liquid flows back into the food pipe from the stomach. This sequence occurs in all people, but it happens more frequently in infants under the age of 1 year.

GER sometimes goes unnoticed, as the liquid remains in the lower food pipe, or the liquid is regurgitated and vomited.

Reflux, or regurgitation, is common in infants and peaks between 3-4 months of age. Some infants regurgitate at least once a day, while some regurgitate with most feeds.

Regurgitation rates decline as the muscle that controls the flow of food matures, usually by the time an infant is 18 months old.

Although more common in adults, GER can develop into gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This condition may cause more troublesome symptoms and complications. Symptoms include slow weight gain, irritability, unexplained crying, and sleep disturbances. GERD requires treatment to avoid tissue damage to the lining of the food pipe.

Sometimes reflux in infants might be caused by a more serious condition, such as:

Most risk factors for infant GER are unavoidable and include:

The following conditions raise the risk of experiencing infant GERD:

GER is uncomplicated, and infants with this type of reflux are often called ""happy spitters."" Infants with GER may sometimes experience frequent vomiting, irritability, prolonged or refused feeding, or back arching.

However, in contrast, symptoms of GERD in infants include:

Infants are unable to say where something hurts, but they may show signs of distress, excessive crying episodes, sleep disturbances, and decreased appetite.

If an infant presents symptoms of GERD, it is important to get advice from a doctor or pediatrician as other, more severe, conditions share some of the symptoms of reflux in infants.

Diagnostic tests are not typically used for diagnosing GER or GERD. Diagnostic tests have not been found to be any more reliable than a doctor asking questions and carrying out a physical examination.

If the baby is growing as expected, appears healthy, and seems content, no further testing is required.

Doctors tend to use diagnostic testing if symptoms do not improve, no weight gain is observed, and lung problems are present

Methods of testing might include ultrasound, blood and urine tests, esophageal pH and impedance monitoring, X-rays, and upper endoscopy and biopsy.

Most cases of regurgitation or reflux resolve within the baby's first year and require no treatment.

Reflux is less frequent and less severe in breastfed babies.

The following changes may help improve infant reflux in formula-fed babies:

In breastfed babies, removing immunogenic foods, such as cow's milk and eggs, from the mother's diet may improve symptoms.

Laying a baby tummy-side down or left side down while awake and after feedings is linked with fewer episodes of infant reflux. However, while asleep, infants are recommended to sleep on their back to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome.

Keeping infants upright for at least 30 minutes following feeds and elevating crib and diaper-changing tables by 30 degrees may also help prevent symptoms of reflux.

Medications are not recommended for children with uncomplicated reflux. Reflux medications can have complications, such as preventing absorption of iron and calcium in infants and increasing the likelihood of developing particular respiratory and intestinal infections.

If feeding and positional changes do not improve GERD, and the infant still has problems with feeding, sleeping, and growth, a doctor may recommend medications to decrease the amount of acid in the infant's stomach.

Medications that might be prescribed include H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). These medications ease symptoms of GERD by lowering acid production in the stomach and can help heal the lining of the food pipe. H2 blockers are usually used for short-term or on-demand relief and PPIs are often used for long-term GERD treatment.

Surgical procedures for infant GERD may only be considered in severe cases. If medications are unsuccessful or there are serious complications, surgery may be an option.

Infants tend to outgrow regurgitation as the lower esophageal sphincter strengthens. Most cases GER will disappear by 18 months of age of earlier.

However, around 2-7 percent of parents of children between the ages of 3-9 years report that their child experiences heartburn, upper abdominal pain, or regurgitation. Around 5-8 percent of teenagers describe the same symptoms.

GERD declines until 12 years of age and then peaks between 16-17 years old. GERD tends to be more common in teenage girls than boys.

GER occurs more often in childhood and GERD occurs more often in adulthood.

Many infants who spit up milk have no complications and ""outgrow it"" after a year. Most cases of reflux will be uncomplicated GER.

Cases of infant GERD can be relieved through diet and lifestyle changes under the guidance of the child's doctor. Medications are also available to minimize reflux, heartburn, and vomiting.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and Treatment","What is seronegative rheumatoid arthritis? What is rheumatoid factor? Learn about what tests may be used and if diet can help to manage symptoms.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315580.php","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Arthritis / Rheumatology","Seronegative Rheumatoid Arthritis: Symptoms, Diagnosis, and TreatmentSeronegative rheumatoid arthritis is one of two types of rheumatoid arthritis, an autoimmune condition that causes pain, swelling, and stiffness at the joints.

The other, and most common, kind of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is seropositive RA.

Seronegative RA is the least common of the two types of RA and does not have the same markers that usually characterize the condition. These markers, which are found in the blood, are anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide (anti-CCP) antibodies or rheumatoid factor.

Rheumatoid factor is a protein produced by the immune system that can attack healthy tissue in the body. Because healthy people do not normally produce rheumatoid factor, the presence of this protein in the blood can indicate that a person may have an autoimmune disease.

As well as RA, conditions associated with rheumatoid factor include:

Although it is very rare, some people without any medical problems produce a small amount of rheumatoid factor, but doctors do not yet understand why this happens.

A doctor may recommend a blood test to determine the presence of rheumatoid factor if a person has any of the following symptoms:

To be diagnosed with seronegative RA, a person must experience symptoms including pain, tenderness, swelling, and redness of multiple joints.

The symptoms must also be symmetrical, which means that the symptoms appear in the same way on both sides of the body.

Other symptoms can include morning stiffness that lasts for longer than 30 minutes, fatigue, and redness of the eyes.

Some experts think that people with seropositive RA experience more severe symptoms than people with seronegative RA. However, some studies have found that there is little difference between the two types of RA in terms of how severe symptoms are.

Although blood tests can determine the presence of rheumatoid factor in a patient's blood, seronegative RA is difficult to diagnose. This is because there is a lack of the usual antibodies that indicate seropositive RA.

However, if someone exhibits strong symptoms usually associated with RA, such as the same joint pain on both sides of the body and inflammation in multiple joints, then a doctor may recommend an X-ray. X-ray results can show the doctor if there is the erosion and damage to the bone and cartilage that are typical symptoms of RA.

People with RA are at increased risk of developing some other chronic conditions. These conditions include Sj gren's syndrome, psoriasis, Felty's syndrome, lupus, and anemia.

Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) may be used to treat symptoms of seronegative RA during flare-ups, but they do not affect the course of the disease. Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs), such as methotrexate, are often prescribed to begin with. Doctors often prescribe steroids as well to get the inflammation under control.

DMARDs restrict the immune system and help to preserve joints by blocking the inflammation that can slowly destroy the joint tissue in people with RA.

Before prescribing DMARDs, the doctor will take an X-ray and blood tests so that they can monitor both the severity of the patient's condition and any side effects over time.

It usually takes a couple of months for the effects of DMARDs to become noticeable. The doctor may prescribe NSAIDs or corticosteroids in the meantime to help with pain and inflammation.

If the DMARDs do not work for a person, a doctor may prescribe medications that work on the immune system in different ways. One example of this type of medication is rituximab, which works specifically on the B cells - one of the many parts of the immune system.

The Arthritis Foundation suggest that eating certain foods may be helpful in managing the symptoms of RA. However, people who have RA should consult with their doctor before implementing any special diets.

The best diet for someone with RA should include lots of plant-based foods. About two-thirds of the diet should come from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, which are all thought to help reduce inflammation. Lean sources of protein and low-fat dairy products should make up the other third of the diet.

The anti-inflammatory properties of omega-3 fatty acids from fish oil have been found to ease pain and stiffness in tender joints. As a result, experts recommend including cold-water fish, such as herring, salmon, and tuna in the diet.

A person with RA should avoid omega-6 fatty acids from corn, safflower, soybean, and sunflower oils as they can increase the risk of joint inflammation and obesity.

Some foods that are associated with making inflammation worse include hamburgers, chicken, and meats that have been grilled or fried at high temperature.

Experts recommend the Mediterranean diet as a simple way for people with RA to achieve a healthful, well-balanced diet that includes the right amount of omega-3 fatty acids, fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Weekend of camping promotes earlier sleep patterns","A weekend of camping could be just the remedy for people that struggle to get an early night, finds scientists from the University of Colorado Boulder.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/315644.php","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 00:00:00 PST","Sleep / Sleep Disorders / Insomnia","Weekend of camping promotes earlier sleep patternsNew research, published in the journal Current Biology, concludes that regardless of the season, spending time outdoors in the natural light - while camping, for example - is enough to reset our internal clocks and enable us to get to sleep earlier.

""Late circadian and sleep timing in modern society are associated with negative performance and health outcomes such as morning sleepiness and accidents, reduced work productivity and school performance, substance abuse, mood disorders, diabetes, and obesity,"" says Kenneth Wright at the University of Colorado Boulder.

""Our findings demonstrate that living in our modern environments contributes to late circadian timing regardless of season and that a weekend camping trip can reset our clock rapidly,"" he adds.

Previous studies by Wright and collaborators showed that daily exposure to electrical lighting at the flick of a switch causes a shift in the internal clock, which results in a delay of around 2 hours and, subsequently, a later bedtime. The team backed up this finding with evidence that shows a shift in the normal fluctuations of melatonin, a hormone responsible for the regulation of the circadian rhythm.

The researchers found that the shift was remedied by a week spent in the summer sun. The internal clock shifted back, which caused people to go to bed earlier, with no change in how long they slept.

While exposure to summer sunlight ""fixed"" the internal body clock, questions remained. The team wondered how the internal clock would respond to seasonal changes if summer were replaced with winter in the study. They also wondered how quickly the internal clock could be reset in the summer setting - did participants need to be outside for a full week, or could the internal clock be changed more rapidly?

To find the answers, Wright and colleagues conducted two studies. The first assessed the impact of the winter natural light-dark cycle on the internal clock compared with electrical lighting. The second evaluated whether the internal clock could be changed over a weekend of exposure to the summer natural light-dark cycle.

The first study involved sending a group of five active individuals camping for a week in Colorado during winter. The researchers timed the study so that the participants went around the time of the winter solstice - when the days were shortest.

The participants were not allowed cell phones or flashlights so that their sleep and hormone rhythms could be examined without the interference of technology that emits artificial light. The results were compared with those taken after the participants spent a week in their modern electrical lighting environment.

After analysis, the team revealed that modern lifestyles reduce light exposure in the winter by 13 times. Spending more time outdoors caused the study participants to go to bed earlier. In a similar way to the results of the previous research, the internal clock and rising of melatonin levels shifted earlier by more than 2.5 hours.

The second study explored whether a weekend of camping in the summer was enough to shift the internal clock.

A total of 14 individuals were split into two groups. Nine of the participants went camping in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado for a weekend, but this time they were allowed flashlights and headlamps, and five of the participants spent the weekend in a modern environment with electrical lighting.

A weekend of camping was, as expected, enough to shift the internal clock. Being exposed to the natural light-dark cycle prevented typical weekend patterns of staying up late and sleeping in, and it stopped the individual's internal clocks from being shifted later.

Although modern conveniences can leave us out of sync with our internal clocks, the research shows that there is an easy solution: light exposure. A weekend of camping could be just the remedy for someone in need of an early night.

Wright points out that consistency is the key. He says that to stay on track with sleeping patterns, a regular schedule is crucial. Among other solutions, Wright suggests that ""increasing daytime exposure to sunlight and reducing nighttime exposure to electrical lighting"" may help.

Future work for the team revolves around finding out how much sunlight is required to adjust the internal clock in either direction, and exploring the link between circadian cycles, exposure to light, and other aspects of health.","Pharmaceuticals"

Out of 104 commissioners of out-of-hours services responding to the publication's request for data under the Freedom of Information Act, ten said there were times when patients were left with no such cover during 2016 because of ""chronic"" staff shortages.

In Peterborough, nine shifts serving 230,000 patients were left uncovered last year, during which time all children were diverted straight to A&E, while in Doncaster nurses and higher-skilled paramedics were handling an area housing 300,000 patients on three occasions, because of a shortage of GPs available out-of-hours, the investigation found.

According to current national quality standards, all patients should be able to see a GP at any time if it is clinically appropriate, but there have been signs of cracks in the out-of-hours system for some time, and the situation could deteriorate even further with the predicted national shortfall of GPs.

""It is a worrying trend. It can be a last-minute appointment that keeps the service afloat, especially at weekends,"" Dr Simon Abrams, a GP in Everton and chair of Urgent Health UK   the representative group for out-of-hours GP providers, told Pulse. ""Erosion of these services not only raises clinical risk in the community but adds to pressure on A&E"".

Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the findings were ""very concerning"".

""It hammers home how important it is for the government to make good on its promise to deliver 5,000 more extra GPs by 2020. More must also be done to address the serious barriers that serve to make working out of hours an unattractive option for GPs - it isn't just the unsociable hours, but the indemnity costs to work out of hours simply make it unviable in many cases. NHS England's winter indemnity scheme should help with rising costs, but they were already high in the first place.""

""Better integration between routine general practice services, and GP out of hours services, is also necessary so that we can work together to ensure proper cover   and so our patients know where to turn when they are sick,"" she stressed.","Healthcare"

Despite the current standard-of-care treatment of PEX and immunosuppression, episodes of aTTP are still associated with a mortality rate of up to 20 percent, and patients are at risk of acute thromboembolic complications such as stroke, venous thrombosis and myocardial infarction as well as a recurrence of the disease.

In a Phase II clinical trial, treatment with caplacizumab resulted in a nearly 40 percent reduction in time to platelet count normalisation as compared to placebo, and also reduced recurrences of aTTP by 71 percent.

In a post-hoc analysis of trial data, a clinically meaningful lower proportion of subjects treated with the drug experienced one or more major thromboembolic events, or died, as compared to placebo (11.4 percent versus 43.2 percent, while fewer caplacizumab-treated patients were refractory to treatment.

The Phase III HERCULES study in patients with aTTP is currently ongoing and is expected to support a BLA filing in the US.

""As pioneers in the treatment of aTTP, we are committed to making caplacizumab available to patients suffering from this severe disease for which there is currently no specifically approved drug available,"" said Dr Edwin Moses, Ablynx' chief executive. ""This is a very important moment in the development of Ablynx, as we prepare to commercialise our first product and become a fully vertically integrated biopharmaceutical company.""

Caplacizumab received Orphan Drug Designation in Europe and the US back in 2009.","Healthcare"
"Cancer rates in women rising six times faster than men","Cancer rates will rise six times faster in women than men over the next 20 years, according to new data from Cancer Research UK.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/cancer_rates_in_women_rising_six_times_faster_than_men_1185764","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 09:20:30 +0000","NA","Cancer rates will rise six times faster in women than men over the next 20 years, according to new data from Cancer Research UK.

The charity is predicting that UK cancer rates will climb by around half a percent for men and by around three percent for women, which means an extra 4.5 million women and 4.8 million men will be diagnosed with the disease by 2035.

Specific cancer types are leading to this rise in women, including, ovarian, cervical and oral cancers where rates are predicted to rise the most over the next 20 years, it says. Also pushing the increase are lifestyle factors such as smoking and obesity, as several of the obesity-related cancer types only affect women.

The latest figures also show the global burden of cancer has reached an estimated 7.4 million men and an estimated 6.7 million women being diagnosed worldwide each year. The disease is the leading cause of death in the world, causing an estimated 8.2 million deaths in 2012 and around 15 percent of all deaths.

""These new figures reveal the huge challenge we continue to face, both in the UK and worldwide,"" said Sir Harpal Kumar, Cancer Research UK's chief executive. ""With more investment into research, we hope to make big improvements over the next 20 years in diagnosing the disease earlier and improving and developing treatments so that by 2034, three in four people will survive their disease.""","Healthcare"
"Pfizer s Ibrance too expensive for NHS use","Cost regulators for the NHS in England and Wales have ruled that Pfizer's Ibrance is too costly in relation to its benefits as a treatment for breast cancer to be funded by the health service.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/pfizers_ibrance_too_expensive_for_nhs_use_1185763","Fri, 03 Feb 2017 08:00:30 +0000","NA","Cost regulators for the NHS in England and Wales have ruled that Pfizer's Ibrance is too costly in relation to its benefits as a treatment for breast cancer to be funded by the health service.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published draft guidelines rejecting the drug's use to treat hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer.

Ibrance (palbociclib) is the first of a new type of drug that increases the effect of aromatase inhibitors, which block the production of the hormone oestrogen, stopping its ability to stimulate some breast cancers to grow.

The committee found that the drug stalled the growth of the cancer for an extra 10 months on average, but concluded that although it was likely that this would result in some improvement in overall survival, this could not be quantified from clinical trials undertaken.

It is estimated around 5,500 people in England would be eligible for treatment with Ibrance, a full course of treatment with which costs  79,650.

""The committee needs more evidence of the drug's impact on overall survival of people with breast cancer. However, even when allowing for these potential benefits, it was still not enough to make palbociclib cost effective at its current price,"" said Professor Carole Longson MBE, director of the centre for health technology assessment at NICE.

The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said it is disappointed Ibrance will not be made available to patients and is calling for ""urgent discussions to reduce the price of the drug"".

""Palbociclib is one of the most important advances in treating the most common type of breast cancer in 20 years. Clinical trials show the drug can substantially slow the progression of the disease and help delay chemotherapy, which often has life-limiting side-effects,"" noted Dr Nicholas Turner, team leader in Molecular Oncology at The ICR and consultant medical oncologist at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, also one of the clinical experts on the NICE panel and lead investigator on the PALOMA-3 trial, which assessed a combination of palbociclib and fulvestrant.

""It is very disappointing that palbociclib is not being made available to patients, but cost is the limiting factor. If the manufacturer, NICE and NHS England can find a way of making this treatment available for patients, they will substantially improve the lives of patients with breast cancer.""

""Rapid action is needed to ensure that exciting new treatments like palbociclib are priced at a level that allows them to be judged cost-effective,"" said Professor Paul Workman, chief executive of The ICR, London.

""In the short term that means urgent discussions to get the price of palbociclib down. In the long term it will require large-scale changes to the whole system of creating new cancer treatments, to reduce the cost of drug development and ensure savings are passed on to the NHS"".","Healthcare"

Physicians can now prescribe Opdivo (nivolumab) patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma (mUC) who have disease progression during or following platinum-containing chemotherapy or have disease progression within 12 months of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment with platinum-containing chemotherapy.

The indication was cleared under accelerated approval based on tumour response rate and duration of response. Full approval may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials, the firm noted.

The application primarily included data from CheckMate-275, a Phase II, open-label, single-arm study assessing the safety and efficacy of Opdivo in patients with the condition, in which 9.6 percent of patients responded to treatment with the drug, with 2.6 percent experiencing a complete response and 17 percent a partial response.

""Most people don't know how common bladder cancer is and that it is the fifth most diagnosed cancer. That's why we are dedicated to raising awareness and supporting research efforts that may offer more treatment options to patients who need them,"" said Stephanie Chisolm, director of Education and Research at Bladder Cancer Advocacy Network.

""This approval is another exciting step forward for the bladder cancer community and provides needed hope to patients and their families.""

Opdivo is a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, already approved in the US for certain patients with melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, renal cell carcinoma and classical Hodgkin lymphoma, and is being assessed in various different tumour types.","Healthcare"
"Continuity of care in general practice linked with fewer hospital admissions","Continuity of care in general practice, that is being able to see the same GP at each appointment, is linked with fewer hospital admissions for older patients with conditions that could be managed in primary care, finds new research published in the British Medical Journal.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/continuity_of_care_in_general_practice_linked_with_fewer_hospital_admissions_1185663","Thu, 02 Feb 2017 10:52:39 +0000","NA","Continuity of care in general practice, that is being able to see the same GP at each appointment, is linked with fewer hospital admissions for older patients with conditions that could be managed in primary care, finds new research published in the British Medical Journal.

Unplanned admissions relating to ambulatory care sensitive conditions - which includes long-term conditions such as asthma and diabetes, where good quality care should prevent flare-ups; acute conditions, such as gangrene, where timely care could stop the condition developing; and conditions preventable by vaccination, such as influenza and pneumonia - cost the NHS in England  1.42 billion in 2009/10.

The research, undertaken by The Health Foundation, looked at 230,472 anonymised records for patients aged 62-82 years who had experienced at least two contacts with a GP between April 2011 and March 2013.

It found that compared with patients with low continuity of care in general practice, those with medium continuity of care experienced 8.96 percent fewer admissions to hospital for such ambulatory care sensitive conditions, and those with high continuity of care experienced 12.49 percent fewer.

Controlling for patient characteristics, the researchers estimate that if patients saw their most frequently seen GP two more times out of every 10 consultations, this would be associated with a 6 percent decrease in admissions.

Also, there was greater evidence for a link between continuity of care and admissions among those with the highest levels of contacts with general practitioners, the study found.

According to the researchers, the findings suggest there is ""opportunity to improve care and reduce hospital admissions among the highest users of healthcare"", but they also stress that as the study is observational, it cannot determine ""whether continuity is a component of high quality care that has a consequential effect on hospital admissions, or whether increased continuity of care and reduced hospital admissions are both outcomes of high quality care"".

Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, Chair of the Royal College of GPs, said the study shows that continuity of care ""can lead to both better health outcomes for patients, and reduced healthcare costs because of fewer hospital admissions"".

""We know that continuity of care is highly valued by patients and GPs and our teams alike with 80 percent of UK family doctors deeming it one of the most essential components of general practice. Good continuity of care can be particularly beneficial to the growing number of patients who are living with multiple, long-term conditions.""

""But delivering continuity of care is becoming increasingly difficult as GPs and our teams struggle to deal with increased patient demand, with fewer resources, and not enough GPs or practice staff. We desperately need the government to deliver the pledges in NHS England's GP Forward View to increase investment in general practice and significantly expand the GP workforce, so that family doctors and our teams can continue to deliver high quality patient care for years to come.""","Healthcare"

Scientists funded by Cancer Research have created a 'map' linking the shape of breast cancer cells to genes switched on and off, and matched it to real disease outcomes, according to a study published in Genome Research.

In a ground-breaking approach, they used large sets of data - from millions of images - to map out a network of links between cell shape and genes, and found that cell shape changes, which can be caused by physical pressures on the tumour, are converted into changes in gene activity, and that these changes are linked with clinical outcomes for patients.

The researchers also identified key areas or 'stations' within the network that acted as hubs for the flow of information, controlling the levels of many other genes.

""Our study reveals an exciting link between the forces that act on cancer cells and the development of the disease,"" said Dr Chris Bakal, team leader in dynamic cell systems at the Institute of Cancer Research.

""We used 'big data' approaches to carry out a complex analysis that would once have taken decades, in a matter of months. The maps we've created of cell shapes and their effects on gene activity provide important pointers to new forms of cancer treatment, and ways of making existing therapies more effective"".

The company said it will use the funds to complete Phase I clinical trials of the product during 2017, following on from a successful preclinical proof-of-concept study, in which the solid dose formulation achieved a statistically similar pharmacokinetic profile to the most widely used clinical dose of the marketed liquid product, Forteo/Forsteo.

Glide has discovered that the use of certain excipients and hardeners allows stable solid dose formulation of many drugs and vaccines that are normally injected in liquid form. To administer these novel formulations, the firm has developed a hand-held 'solid dose injector'.

The patented internal mechanism of the SDI responds to the slight rise in pressure so created by ejecting the drug dose and pushing it into the subcutaneous layer of the skin, and the firm says that research it has carried out show that volunteers prefer drug delivery by SDI to injection by needle and syringe.

Dr Mark Carnegie-Brown, Glide Technologies' chief executive, said the new fundraising ""enables us to progress the clinical development of our pipeline as we move towards our goal of creating a patient-centric delivery platform integrating formulation science and device engineering"".

Core earnings for the period came in a $1.21 per share, a rise of 29 percent over the year ago period, or 9 percent when taking currency effects out of the equation. The results beat analyst expectations of $1.14 a share (compiled by Cantor Fitzgerald).

Fourth-quarter revenues hit $5.6 billion, 12 percent down on a year ago (at constant exchange rates), as generic competition continued to hit sales of cholesterol blockbuster Crestor (rosuvastatin), which plummeted 53 percent to $631 million.

Core operating profit for the period was just over $2 billion, up 15 percent on the fourth quarter of 2015.

For the full year, the company booked core earnings of $4.31, down 5 percent on the previous year, revenues of $23 billion, also down 5 percent, and a 7 percent fall in core operating profit to $6.7 billion.

Performance highlights include: 6 percent growth in sales from emerging markets to $5.8 billion, supported by China, up by 10 percent to $2.6 billion; an 11 percent rise in the diabetes franchise, as Farxiga (dapagliflozin) became the AZ' largest-selling diabetes medicine with turnover of $835 million (up 4 percent); a 39 percent leap in sales of cardiovascular therapy Brilinta (ticagrelor) to $839 million; and strong sales of new oncology drugs, which hit $664 million, of which Tagrisso (osimertinib) brought in $423 million from its first year on the market for lung cancer.

On the downside, Japan saw a sales decline of 3 percent to $2.2 billion, reflecting the biennial price reduction in the year, while there was also a 3 percent drop in sales from the firm's respiratory segment to $4.8 billion because of US pricing pressure for Symbicort (fluticasone furoate/umeclidinium/vilantero), which fell 10 percent to just under $3 billion.

Commenting on the results, chief executive Pascal Soriot said they ""reflected the ongoing transition of our company"".

""Our underlying business is growing as a new AstraZeneca emerges, driven by competitive franchises and Emerging Markets,"" he said, adding that ""2017 has the potential to be a turning point for our company as we near the end of our patent-expiry period and bring new medicines to patients across the globe"".

""This year we have the opportunity to launch several life-changing medicines for cancer, respiratory and metabolic diseases. It is an exciting time as we rapidly approach the inflection point for our anticipated return to long-term growth, built on the solid foundations of a science-led pipeline.""

The charity also noted that the actual figure could be much higher because of underdiagnosis and undiscovered faulty genes, which can raise a person's risk of suffering potentially fatal conditions.

These conditions can affect people of any age and can be inherited but, for many families, the first sign that of a problem is when someone dies suddenly from a cardiac arrest or heart attack with no obvious cause or explanation.

""If undetected and untreated, inherited heart conditions, can be deadly and they continue to devastate families, often by taking away loved ones without warning,"" said BHF medical director Professor Sir Nilesh Samani.

Each week in the UK around 12 seemingly healthy people aged 35 or under are victims of sudden cardiac death with no explanation, largely because of these inherited conditions.

BHF-funded research has helped identify many of the faulty genes behind inherited heart conditions, which has led to the development of genetic testing services for those at highest risk for some of them, but more research is urgently needed for improved detection methods and treatment, the charity noted.

""We urgently need to fund more research to better understand these heart conditions, make more discoveries, develop new treatments and save more lives,"" said Prof Samani.","Healthcare"

The European Commission has approved Keytruda (pembrolizumab) for the first-line treatment of metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in adults whose tumours have high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score [TPS] of 50 percent or more) with no EGFR or ALK positive tumour mutations.

Clearance is based on data from the Phase III Keynote-024 trial, which showed superior overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) with Keytruda compared to chemotherapy, the current standard of care for advanced NSCLC.

In the study, Keytruda reduced the risk of disease progression or death by 50 percent compared to chemotherapy, while the median PFS was 10.3 months versus 6.0 months for chemotherapy.

""The approval of Keytruda as a first treatment instead of chemotherapy for patients who express high levels of PD-L1 has the potential to transform the way metastatic non-small cell lung cancer is treated,"" said Dr Roy Baynes, senior vice president, head of clinical development, and chief medical officer, Merck Research Laboratories.

""We are committed to ensuring that patients in Europe - who are in need of new treatment options - are able to quickly gain access to Keytruda.""

Keytruda is a humanised monoclonal antibody that works by increasing the ability of the body's immune system to help detect and fight tumour cells, by blocking the interaction between PD-1 and its ligands to activate T lymphocytes.

The new green light follows the drug's approval in August 2016 for previously-treated patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC whose tumours express PD-L1 (TPS of 1 percent or more) and who have received at least one prior chemotherapy regimen.

"NHS trusts failing to claw back health tourism costs","NHS trusts are failing to recoup the cost of treating overseas patients which is squeezing the amount available to fund services for those eligible for free care, a report by the Public Accounts Committee has warned.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/nhs_trusts_failing_to_claw_back_health_tourism_costs_1185565","Wed, 01 Feb 2017 10:08:33 +0000","NA","NHS trusts are failing to recoup the cost of treating overseas patients which is squeezing the amount available to fund services for those eligible for free care, a report by the Public Accounts Committee has warned.

Since the Department of Health launched its overseas visitor and migrant cost recovery programme in 2014, the amount charged for so-called health tourists has jumped from from  97 million to  289 million (in 2015/16), but this is still far below the  500 million target.

Crucially, the PAC found that most of the progress to date has been driven by changes in the charging rules rather than from trusts implementing existing rules more effectively, and it stressed that current systems for cost recovery ""appear chaotic"".

""If the NHS does not recover the cost of treating patients who are not entitled to free care, then there is less money available to treat other people and even more pressure on NHS finances,"" the report stressed.

Also, the UK recovers far less from other European Economic Area and Switzerland (EEA&S) states than these countries claim from the UK: in 2014/15, the UK recovered only  50 million but paid out  675 million, the report said, noting that while some of the difference can be explained by the cost of treating British state pensioners who live abroad, ""it is clear that hospitals are not identifying all the overseas patients they treat"".

The Committee is calling on the Department of Health to improve systems for cost recovery and ""do more to promote public confidence that the money due to the NHS is being recovered, and that the system is fair to taxpayers and to patients who are entitled to free care"".

While the DH is planning further changes relating to policy and regulation, good practice and IT, the PAC said it is ""not convinced that enough is being done to identify and charge overseas patients"".

""The Government's failure to get a grip on recovering the costs of treating overseas visitors is depriving the NHS of vital funds,"" said PAC chair Meg Hillier. ""We are concerned that financial progress to date does not reflect meaningful progress with implementing the rules and the Department for Health and NHS have much to do if they are to meet their target for cost recovery.""

Action plan

The PAC recommends the DH publish, by June 2017 at the latest, an action plan setting out specific actions, milestones and performance measures for increasing the amount recovered from overseas visitors, which should also name senior individuals in the Department and NHS Improvement whom the Committee can hold to account.

It also says that NHS Improvement should collect and share data on the performance of trusts in charging patients and recovering money, and intervene when performance is clearly falling short, and argues that GPs ""could do more to help the NHS increase the amounts recovered for treating chargeable overseas patients"".

But Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of General Practitioners, warned against ""perpetuating this idea that general practice should, in whatever way, assist with border control"".

""Patients share information with their GP on the mutual understanding that it will remain confidential. We are very concerned that any process that undermines that crucial trust between doctors and patients will both deteriorate the doctor-patient relationship, and deter vulnerable people from seeking medical assistance when they need it"".

She also argued that ""we shouldn't exaggerate the amount of money that can be raised through GPs getting involved in cost recovery - particularly when balanced against the administrative and training costs that introducing such a process would incur.""","Healthcare"

Affecting up to one million people worldwide, TSC is a rare genetic disorder that can lead to non-cancerous tumours being formed in vital organs, as well as linked disorders such as epilepsy, autism, cognitive impairment, behavioural problems and psychiatric disorders.

 

The approval makes Votubia (everolimus) the first adjunctive treatment approved in the region specifically for partial-onset seizures in children and adults with TSC, which could help address an unmet need given that up to 60 percent of patients become unresponsive to available anti-epileptic therapies.

 

The nod was based on efficacy and safety data from a pivotal Phase III study (EXIST-3), which found that when used as an adjunctive therapy, seizure response rate ( 50 percent reduction) was significantly greater with Novartis drug at both low exposure (28.2 percent) and high exposure (40.0 percent) versus placebo (15.1 percent).

On the safety side, the most common all-grade adverse events of any cause reported during the core phase at frequencies of greater than 15 percent in both Votubia treatment arms included stomatitis, diarrhoea, fever, nasopharyngitis, and upper respiratory tract infection, the firm said.

""With this latest approval of Votubia in the EU, patients with TSC suffering from refractory partial-onset seizures   one of the most debilitating manifestations of TSC   now have a new therapeutic option to address a critical unmet need,"" said Bruno Strigini, chief executive of Novartis Oncology. ""This is a welcome advance and an important milestone in our ongoing commitment to improving care for this patient community.""

 

In the EU, Votubia is also cleared for the treatment of adult patients with renal angiomyolipoma associated with TSC who are at risk of complications but who do not require immediate surgery, and patients with subependymal giant cell astrocytoma (SEGA) associated with TSC who require therapeutic intervention but are not amenable to surgery.","Healthcare"

This accounts for 38% of all programs with a disclosed molecular target and reflects the high degree of innovation in this indication, according to business intelligence provider GBI Research.

The company s latest report states that potential factors driving the pipeline include a significant level of unmet need due to melanoma s poor prognosis and high incidence of therapeutic resistance, and the paucity of effective approved options in the market landscape. This is particularly true of chemotherapeutics, and a strong understanding of the disease pathophysiology has developed over the last decade, facilitating the development of novel compounds.

Callum Dew, Associate Analyst for GBI Research, explains:  Despite a high attrition rate in oncology indications, it is highly likely that numerous first-in-class products in the melanoma pipeline, many of which are supported by promising preclinical data, will reach the market over the coming decade. This will potentially transform the clinical and commercial landscape, and has far-reaching strategic implications for all market participants. 

While targeted therapies such as Opdivo and Keytruda have made a strong impact on the melanoma space, unmet needs still remain, not only with regard to safer and more effective therapies but also for further therapy options for patients with non-cutaneous melanoma.

Dew continues:  It appears that the greatest promise in addressing these needs could come in the form of combining novel therapeutics with currently marketed therapies, in order to provide effective treatment and improve patient survival. These combinations are most likely to comprise of an immunotherapeutic and a targeted therapy, or a combination of multiple targeted therapies. This could create a paradigm shift for future melanoma treatment.

 Combination therapeutics seem likely to radically change the melanoma market over the coming years, which could involve combinations of currently marketed products and new novel programs. In terms of the melanoma deals landscape, the majority of deals involve currently established targets, and there are 176 first-in-class programs not involved in prior deals.

 As attention shifts towards combining drugs, companies with the most promising novel developmental programs may seek strategic consolidations with other companies that have current developmental or marketed products. 

Melanoma is known as the deadliest form of skin cancer and is one of the resistant and aggressive of the treatment-resistant cancers. The prominence of the disease has risen over recent decades due to a rise in UV light and or sunlight exposure.

In the US, the long-awaited draft guidance for biosimilar labelling was finally released.[4] However, the uptake of approved biosimilars was less than modest. Part of the reason for this was the identified knowledge gaps among physicians. In a study conducted between late 2015 and January 2016, 91% of physicians were found to be willing to prescribe biosimilars, but only 45% agreed that such products would be appropriate and safe for their patients  use.[8] Biosimilars were predicted to  rock the boat  in 2016, but this year was more about building and sustaining the interest and trust in the new products.

Data from incrowd has shown that more doctors say yes to biosimilars with 84% Anticipate Prescribing Biosimilars in Next 3 Years, up by 14% from 6 months prior. However, level of caution has increased with those Accepting Pharmacy-Level Substitution Dropping From 28% to 17%. More elements are said to be considered in their choice to prescribe them at all.

Among the top 10 most important factors in deciding to prescribe a biosimilar, physicians now are placing greater emphasis on thought leader opinions and professional organization guidelines -- now at 55%, from 46% in February -- as well as patient acceptance of biosimilars, up to 49% from 40%.

Comments from the database illustrated their increased caution. ""At this time I would not be amenable to switching a patient from a stable medication without significant data to prove complete compatibility,"" said one rheumatologist. ""I would wait and let other doctors experiment on their patients,"" said an oncologist

Although, figures relating to physicians who would only prescribe biosimilars if they were forced to do so, or there were specific patient conditions that warranted a move away from the originating biologic   dropped from 26% in February 2016 to 16% in September.

The future continues to look positive for biosimilars . As per a recent report, Global Biosimilars Market contributed an overall revenue of $2,552.0 million in 2014 and is forecast to generate an approximate revenue of $26,551.3 million by 2020, growing at a CAGR of 49.1% from 2015 to 2020.

Low pricing of biosimilars, reliable and timely formulated regulations, ease in developing biosimilar, and a quick approval of the drugs by concerned regulators are key driving factors fostering the growth of the market.

The development, approval and acceptance of biosimilars is predicted to increase in 2017. As of October 2016, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved four biosimilars, which are setting up for launch in 2017, and there are several biosimilars still awaiting approval and launch.[1] With the cost of many innovator biologics on the rise, biosimilars will definitely continue to gain traction among payers in the coming year.

In the 2016 Biosimilars Forum[2] survey on doctors, some of the identified knowledge gaps were in:

In response to the slow uptake of biosimilars, several biologics companies have provided education or opened discussions about the product. Throughout 2016, patient groups, professional societies, health authorities and think tanks joined the conversations and knowledge sharing, which has fuelled the interest among patients and physicians to try biosimilars.

Governments are also zoning in on the regulatory frameworks to facilitate the biosimilar path-to-market, which is augmenting support for the product s use. Before the end of 2017, the FDA is set to publish draft guidance on interchangeability considerations of biosimilars and statistical considerations for the analysis of biosimilarity.[3]","Pharmaceuticals"

2.    A rise in the number of innovative payment schemes

The year 2016 truly highlighted the patient as the ultimate customer of pharma and healthcare, but 2017 will see payers as the primary customer segment to target. In the coming year, payers can be expected to impose more price cuts and greater spending scrutiny. Subsequently, more and more pharma companies will be willing to explore innovative pricing and reimbursement schemes with payers. A specialty reimbursement report found that the number of US payers with at least one pay-for-performance contract increased from 10% in 2014 to 14% in 2016; and another 30% have plans to entertain outcomes-based contracts in 2017.

Executing and demonstrating cost-effectiveness will be a recurring topic during negotiations between pharma and payers. Cost-effectiveness is laborious to prove, especially when outcomes are not easily measured (as with orphan conditions) or when it takes time before outcomes become measurable (as with long-term conditions). Nonetheless, the drive for cost-effectiveness will push pharma to keep on developing innovative pricing schemes.

Specifically, there will be increased confidence in, and a more defined protocol for, risk sharing or performance-based agreements. Payers, insurers and government health authorities have gained familiarity with these innovative schemes in the recent past, especially in contracts with physician groups and large hospitals. Therefore, they will be more willing to listen and explore pharma s proposed value-based purchasing models.

The hunt for value will continue. Pharma s option is to continue shifting away from a product-orientation and focusing efforts towards a service-orientation. The development of value added services is likely to continue in 2017 in the form of beyond-the-pill benefits, adherence, and patient management apps/services. With the unique ability to enable self-management and diagnosis, remote tracking and monitoring, fluid communication with practitioners, and remote education, the arena of wearable medical devices will continue to thrive. The mHealth market revenue is projected to grow to $26 Billion with a consequent annual global healthcare cost savings amounting to $370 Billion by the end of 2017.","Pharmaceuticals"

Harvard Business Review asserts that despite  astonishing advancements  in recent years, the medical field is often ineffective, inefficient and not so consumer-friendly. However, there are some new innovations that have proven to be exactly the opposite. While it may be soon to determine if these new tech advancements will be long-lasting and worthwhile, here are a few notable ones to keep an eye on:

According to experts,these tiny sensors , so small that they can fit on the back of a honey bee, are driving innovation in the medical industry. Created by Dr. David Sretavan, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of California San Francisco, the tiny ocular sensor could make a trip to the doctor s office to assess glaucoma risk nearly obsolete. Dr. Sretavan s sensor is a single example of a medicine industry trend that is merging nanotechnology and biomedicine. Current pressure monitoring technologies are rather crude, says Dr. Sretavan, and are not designed for patients to use at home, as it takes a skilled hand. Though still being developed, one potential option is to have the ocular sensor anchored to the iris in order to collect regular measurements.

In today s technology-driven world, apps are used to collect a wide variety of data, some of which can be potentially life-changing. The S Health app, for example, which pairs best with cutting-edge mobile devices, like the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge and the Samsung Gear S3, can be used to track sleep as well as eating and exercise habits. In addition to tracking health-related data from the user, the app provides access to health articles, including workout tips and healthy living advice. The S Health app puts data and trusted advice into the user s hand   no doctor s appointment required.

Available to subscribers via desktop, tablet or smartphone,  the UpToDate app provides medical calculators, search features, information on drugs and drug reactions and full text articles for patient education. In fact, there are currently more than 1,500 patient education topics that can found via the app. This app takes the hard work out of sourcing credible and trusted medical information online, providing both patients and practicing doctors with important information, data and facts. Plus, it's accessible. 20 years ago, information like this was not accessible to the average person. Now, thanks to innovations in the medical field, it is.

Virtual reality is one of the most trendy technologies today. And VR is becoming increasingly used as a means to diagnose health issues. Not just for games, VR is a major player in the healthcare arena, as it's currently used in surgery simulation, robotic surgery, skills training, phobia treatment and more. The VR HumanSim system, for example, enables medical personnel to interact with patients in a 3-D environment. The experience even measures a person s emotional response. As for diagnosing patients, virtual reality technology is being compared to MRI scans, as it can be used to arrive at the same diagnosis and the traditional technology. VR in diagnosing also removes the need for surgery and other normally invasive procedures. However, there is still much more research and development that needs to be done in the VR healthcare sphere before it becomes more widely-adopted.","Pharmaceuticals"

The statement, issued to news outlets since Friday, comes a month after Lilly disclosed that it planned to eliminate the jobs of 485 field-based employees based in its Integrated Health Partners (IHP)/Cardiovascular Account Specialists organization within the company s U.S. Bio-Medicines Business Unit.

In a January 6 letter to Indiana s Department of Workforce Development and Indianapolis Mayor Joseph H. Hogsett, Lilly blamed the elimination of the 485 jobs on the failure of its candidate solanezumab in the Phase III EXPEDITION3 clinical trial which assessed the monoclonal antibody in patients with mild dementia due to Alzheimer's disease as well as a decision to end the promotion of unspecified medications.

However, Lilly has said publicly in recent days that the new round of 200 R&D layoffs is unrelated to the solanezumab failure.

Just last week, Lilly CEO David Ricks was among biopharma leaders who, along with industry groups, spoke positively about a meeting with President Trump in which he pressed for companies to create more U.S. jobs, repatriate to the U.S. operations that have been shifted to lower-tax countries overseas, as well as reduce drug prices, while expressing his commitment to reducing regulation, including through an FDA overhaul.

 We talked about a number of his policy proposals which, on balance, I think would be very good for us,  Ricks told The Indianapolis Star newspaper following a conference call in which he told analysts:  I was impressed with the president s appreciation for what our industry is, which is really a crown jewel of American enterprise. 

At the end of 2015, according to its most recent Form 10-K annual report filed last year, Lilly employed approximately 41,275 people, including approximately 23,425 employees outside the U.S. While overall employment rose from 39,135 at the end of 2014, much of that year-over-year job growth took place outside the U.S., where the company based 21,920 employees, the company stated in its Form 10-K for 2014.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Snap Quiz Determines Biocompatibility of Nanoparticles","Biomedical nanoparticles (NP) show great promise, but not all of them will make the grade. Some will be toxic. Some will have adverse interactions with macrophages. Some will induce harmful inflammatory reactions. Unfortunately, NP effects on the body are often unpredictable. In the absence of quick and reliable tests for NP safety and biocompatibility, NP development is stunted, and the clinical use of these virus-sized elements remains limited. 
 
	A new approach to NP testing has been developed by researchers from the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Fribourg (UNIFR), Switzerland.

Some will be toxic. Some will have adverse interactions with macrophages. Some will induce harmful inflammatory reactions. Unfortunately, NP effects on the body are often unpredictable. In the absence of quick and reliable tests for NP safety and biocompatibility, NP development is stunted, and the clinical use of these virus-sized elements remains limited.

A new approach to NP testing has been developed by researchers from the Universities of Geneva (UNIGE) and Fribourg (UNIFR), Switzerland. They propose that NP candidates be tested for three attributes at once, accelerating and improving the reproducibility of the NP screening process. Ultimately, the new screening approach could fast-track NP applications such as contrast agents and drug-delivery vehicles.

Details of the new approach appeared February 2 in the journal Nanoscale, in an article entitled,  A Rapid Screening Method to Evaluate the Impact of Nanoparticles on Macrophages.  The new approach, the article indicated, could take less than a week to determine whether NP are compatible or not with the human body an analysis that previously required several months of work.

 This assay is proposed as a standardized screening protocol to obtain a rapid overview of the impact of different types of NP on macrophages,  wrote the article s authors.  Three essential questions are answered in parallel, in a single multiwell plate: Are the NP taken up by macrophages? Do the NP cause macrophage cell death? Do the NP induce inflammatory reactions? 

The study focused on macrophages because these cells are found on the front line of the immune system. They can, through their appetite for NP and their ability to trigger immune responses, predict the degree to which NP under investigation might be compatible with the human body.

The ideal medical NP should not be toxic (it should not kill the macrophages); it should not be entirely ingested by the macrophages (so that it retains its power to act); and it should limit the activation of the immune system (to avoid adverse side-effects).

Until now, evaluating the biocompatibility of nanomaterials was a laborious task that took several months and posed reproducibility problems, since not all the tests were performed on the same batch of particles. In the current study, the three essential elements of biocompatibility were assessed by means of flow cytometry.

 The macrophages are brought into contact with the NP for 24 hours, and are then passed in front of the laser beams,  explained In s Mottas, the first author of the Nanoscale paper.  The fluorescence emitted by the macrophages makes it possible to count them and characterize their activation levels. Since the particles themselves are fluorescent, we can also measure the amount ingested by the macrophages.

 Our process means we can test the three elements simultaneously, and we only need a very small amount of particles,  continued Mottas.  We can obtain a comprehensive diagnosis of the NP submitted to us in 2 or 3 days. 

""Researchers can spend years developing a NP, without knowing what impact it will have on a living organism,"" explained Carole Bourquin, professor in the medicine and science faculties at UNIGE and project leader. ""So, there was a real need to design an effective screening method that could be implemented at the beginning of the development process. Indeed, if the NP aren't compatible, several years of research were simply thrown away. 

 When you begin to develop a new particle, it's very difficult to ensure that the recipe is exactly the same every time,  Mottas elaborated.  If we test different batches, the results may differ. Hence our idea of finding a way to test the three parameters simultaneously and on the same sample to establish the product's biocompatibility: its toxicity, its ability to activate the immune system, and the capacity of the macrophages to ingest them. 

The method devised in Geneva and Freiburg is already helping scientists to develop new particles. It focuses their work by enabling them to select the most promising particles quickly.  Due to high reproducibility,  the article s authors added,  this method also allows quality control assessment for such aspects as immune-activating contaminants and batch-to-batch variability. 

Besides having a financial impact on the cost of research, this new approach also limits the use of animal testing. Furthermore, it is opening the door to the increasingly personalized treatment of certain pathologies. For example, by testing the NP on tumor cells isolated from a particular patient, it should theoretically be possible to identify the most effective treatment.","Pharmaceuticals"

Findings from the news study were published recently in Experimental Gerontology in an article entitled  Examining the Impact of Grape Consumption on Brain Metabolism and Cognitive Function in Patients with Mild Decline in Cognition: A Double-Blinded Placebo Controlled Pilot Study. 

 The study examines the impact of grapes as a whole fruit versus isolated compounds, and the results suggest that regular intake of grapes may provide a protective effect against early decline associated with Alzheimer's disease,"" explained lead study investigator Daniel Silverman, M.D., Ph.D., head of the neuronuclear imaging section of the Ahmanson Translational Imaging Division at UCLA. ""This pilot study contributes to the growing evidence that supports a beneficial role for grapes in neurologic and cardiovascular health; however, more clinical studies with larger groups of subjects are needed to confirm the effects observed here.""

Subjects in the study with early memory decline were randomly selected to receive either whole grape powder equivalent to just 2  cups of grapes per day or a polyphenol-free placebo powder matched for flavor and appearance. Cognitive performance was measured at baseline and 6 months later. Changes in brain metabolism, assessed by brain positron emission tomography (PET) scans, were also measured at baseline and 6 months later. PET scans provide valuable predictive and diagnostic value to clinicians evaluating patients with dementia symptoms.

The investigators showed that consuming grapes preserved healthy metabolic activity in the regions of the brain that are typically affected by the earliest stages of Alzheimer's disease, where metabolic decline takes hold. Interestingly, the subjects who didn't consume grapes exhibited a significant metabolic decline in these critical regions. Moreover, those consuming the grape-enriched diet showed beneficial changes in regional brain metabolism that correlated to improvements in cognition and working memory performance.

For years scientists have suspected grape polyphenols are part of a healthy diet, as they promote antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities. Over the years, research has suggested that grapes may help support brain health by working in multiple ways from reducing oxidative stress in the brain to promoting healthy blood flow in the brain to helping maintain levels of a key brain chemical that promotes memory to exerting anti-inflammatory effects.

As there are currently 5.4 million Americans living with Alzheimer's disease, and the numbers continue to grow, researchers continue to look for new and different ways to prevent and treat the neurodegenerative decline.","Pharmaceuticals"

Strata is conducting an observational study designed to provide no-cost tumor sequencing to 100,000 advanced cancer patients, as well as offer pharma companies exclusive access to stratified patient populations, with the goal of shortening clinical development timelines.

Launched in December 2016, the Strata trial  aims to study the impact of sequencing on clinical trial enrollment,  Strata Oncology states on its website, adding:  Our goal is to dramatically expand patient access to tumor sequencing and precision medicine trials, and to accelerate the approval of breakthrough cancer medicines. 

At the time of the trial s launch, Strata had completed collaboration agreements with its first two cancer center partners, University of North Carolina (UNC) Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center and University of Alabama (UAB) Comprehensive Cancer Center.

As part of the trial, Strata Oncology said, it will identify individuals with NHL whose tumors have EZH2-activating mutations for potential enrollment into Epizyme's ongoing Phase II clinical trial of tazemetostat.

 The addition of tazemetostat to Strata's growing portfolio of programs furthers our goal of providing cancer patients with greater access to clinical trials specific to their cancer type,  Strata Oncology President and CEO Dan Rhodes, Ph.D., said in a statement.

Tazemetostat is an orally administered, first-in-class small-molecule EZH2 inhibitor under development to treat multiple types of hematological malignancies and genetically defined solid tumors.

Tazemetostat is under study as a single-agent therapy in multiple clinical trial, including Phase II clinical trials in patients with relapsed or refractory NHL; adult patients with certain genetically defined solid tumors, including INI1-negative tumors and synovial sarcoma; and patients with mesothelioma characterized by BAP loss of function.

Epizyme is also conducting a clinical trial of tazemetostat in pediatric patients with certain genetically defined solid tumors, including INI1-negative tumors and synovial sarcoma, as well as clinical trials where tazemetostat is being evaluated as part of combination therapies. One study is assessing tazemetostat with the chemotherapy regimen R-CHOP (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone, plus the monoclonal antibody rituximab) as a first-line treatment for newly diagnosed elderly, high-risk patients with the most common type of NHL, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) a study being conducted with the Lymphoma Study Association.

In early clinical development, according to Epizyme, tazemetostat has demonstrated clinical activity and a generally well-tolerated safety profile in both patients with hematological malignancies and genetically defined solid tumors.

Epizyme holds development and commercialization rights to tazemetostat worldwide except Japan, where Eisai holds those rights, as well as a right of first negotiation to rights in the rest of Asia.","Pharmaceuticals"

Moreover, newborn and adult mice exposed to thirdhand smoke led to persistent changes in blood cell counts associated with the immune system for both newborn and adult mice. The blood cell count changes are associated with inflammatory and allergic reactions upon exposure to thirdhand smoke, the researchers said.

Berkeley Lab researchers from the Biological Systems and Engineering Division and the Energy Technologies Area (ETA) teamed up with scientists at the University of California, San Francisco and Nanjing Medical University for the study. The findings (""Early Exposure to Thirdhand Cigarette Smoke Affects Body Mass and the Development of Immunity in Mice"") published in Scientific Reports, suggest that the dangers associated with smoking continue long after the cigarette is snuffed out.

""We suspected that the young are most vulnerable because of their immature immune systems, but we didn't have a lot of hard evidence to show that before,"" said study lead author Bo Hang, M.D., Ph.D., a Berkeley Lab staff scientist who previously found that thirdhand smoke could lead to genetic mutations in human cells. ""In this case, we found that thirdhand smoke appeared to inhibit weight gain in neonatal mice, but not in the young adults.""

Notably, the weight effect was temporary. Weeks after smoke exposure stopped, the mice began catching up with their nonexposed peers in weight.

The researchers noted that human babies and toddlers are at greater risk because they come into contact with contaminated surfaces while crawling or teething during a critical window of immune system development.

While the harmful effects of active and secondhand smoking have been well-established by decades of extensive studies, research into thirdhand smoke is still in its nascent stages. But evidence is mounting that the residue lingering on indoor surfaces could be just as harmful, if not more, than secondhand smoke.

Red flags were raised in 2010 when Berkeley Lab studies led by researchers in ETA's Indoor Environment Group found that nicotine can react with ozone and nitrous acid in the air to create ultrafine organic aerosols and cancer-causing compounds. Subsequent studies led by Dr. Hang, Jian-Hua Mao, Ph.D., and Altaf Sarker, Ph.D., at Berkeley Lab found that thirdhand smoke led to genetic instability in human and mouse cell lines and in mouse models.

The new study goes further by characterizing the biological effects of exposure to thirdhand smoke, an environment created by placing 5-cm2 pieces of smoke-contaminated cotton cloth in the cages with the mice. The researchers focused on changes to body weight and the hematopoietic system after 3 weeks of exposure for two age groups of mice: birth to 3 weeks (neonatal) and 12 to 15 weeks (young adult). They were compared to a control group of mice that were not exposed to smoke.

While the effects on weight were only seen in the neonatal mice, changes in blood cell populations were evident in both age groups. In general, there were lower levels of platelets and specific types of white blood cells in the smoke-exposed mice. For example, neonatal mice exposed to thirdhand smoke had higher levels of eosinophils, female adults had higher levels of neutrophils, male adults had higher levels of basophils, and all mice had higher levels of B cells.

""Those are all types of white blood cells associated with inflammation and allergic reactions,"" said Dr. Mao, the current study's corresponding author. ""And the effects on blood cell count persisted even after exposure ended. Changes remained at least 14 weeks after exposure ended for the neonatal group, and two weeks after it ended for the adults.""

The researchers pointed out that they did not study whether the observed biological changes led to specific diseases or other health outcomes, but that other studies suggest links to adverse health effects.

""Thirdhand smoke is an underappreciated risk factor in health,"" said study co-author Antoine Snijders, Ph.D. ""It's clear that more and bigger studies are needed, particularly in humans, so we can support policy decisions on thirdhand smoke.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Innate said that analyses of data generated by EffiKIR were ongoing, with full trial data set to be submitted to an unspecified future medical conference as well as for publication.

Adverse events encountered with lirilumab  were consistent with the previously reported safety profile of lirilumab,  the company added.

Lirilumab is being investigated in six trials sponsored by Bristol-Myers Squibb (BMS) across a variety of solid and hematological cancer indications in combination with other agents, including BMS  marketed cancer drug Opdivo (nivolumab).

Details of this work appeared February 2 in the journal Nature, in an article entitled,  Zika Virus Protection by a Single Low-Dose Nucleoside-Modified mRNA Vaccination.  The article described how the new candidate vaccine elicited rapid and durable protective immunity without adverse events. This vaccine is the first to show such potent and long-lasting protection without the use of a live virus.

 Here, we demonstrate that a single low-dose intradermal immunization with lipid nanoparticle-encapsulated nucleoside-modified mRNA (mRNA-LNP) encoding the pre-membrane and envelope (prM-E) glycoproteins of a 2013 ZIKV outbreak strain elicited potent and durable neutralizing antibody responses in mice and non-human primates,  wrote the article s authors.  Immunization with 30  g of nucleoside-modified ZIKV mRNA-LNPs protected mice from ZIKV challenges at 2 weeks or 5 months post-vaccination, and a single dose of 50  g was sufficient to protect non-human primates from a challenge at 5 weeks post-vaccination. 

Injected mRNAs normally would be cleared from the body within minutes by a patient's immune system, but these mRNAs are modified so that they are ignored by the immune system and can easily enter cells. Once inside cells, they are taken up by cellular protein-making machinery and induce the production, over weeks, of the viral proteins they encode.

This extended production of viral proteins mimics what a live virus vaccine would achieve. Live virus vaccines using slow-replicating versions of the virus they are meant to protect against tend to induce much more powerful immune protection compared to vaccines that are based on nonreplicating versions of a virus or isolated viral proteins. Live virus vaccines have serious potential drawbacks, though, including harmful infection with the virus in people who have weakened immune systems.

Some newer vaccine candidates use harmless viruses, such as modified adenoviruses, to deliver genes that encode immunizing viral proteins. To date, an adenovirus-based strategy is the only Zika vaccine candidate that has shown strong protection in monkeys with a single dose; however, the immune system tends to attack adenoviruses, and in some cases, it may neutralize them before they can deliver their immunizing payloads.

The mRNA-based strategy has none of these drawbacks.

The new candidate vaccine contains mRNAs encoding two key proteins from a Zika virus strain isolated in a 2013 outbreak. The researchers found that in mice, a single injection of 30 millionths of a gram of these mRNAs a small fraction of the dose used for a typical vaccine induced a rapid immune response, which protected mice from intravenous exposure to a separate Zika strain 2 weeks later. That protection, resulting in zero detectable virus in the bloodstream a few days after exposure, was maintained even when the mice were exposed to Zika virus 5 months after vaccination.

Tests in macaque monkeys also showed that a single vaccine dose of only 50  g provided strong protection against exposure to Zika virus 5 weeks later.

In both cases, virus neutralization tests indicated that the vaccine induced high levels of antibodies that block Zika infection levels that peaked after several weeks and thereafter remained high enough to be protective, potentially for years.

""Our work so far suggests that this new vaccine strategy induces a level of virus neutralization about 25 times greater, after a single dose, than one sees in standard vaccines,"" said Drew Weissman, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of infectious disease at Penn and the senior author of the current study.

The powerful, durable protection conferred by the candidate vaccine is due in large part to its strong stimulation of CD4 helper T cells, which are important for maintaining long-term antibody immunity.

The mRNA vaccine approach has other advantages, Dr. Weissman added: ""If a vaccine is effective after just a single immunization, the infrastructure needed for its administration can be much simpler. Production of an mRNA-based vaccine is also likely to be easier and less expensive compared to traditional virus- or viral protein-based vaccines.""

Dr. Weissman and colleagues are also applying their mRNA-based strategy to the development of other vaccines and therapies.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Marijuana Could Ease Burden of Opioid Addiction","In 2014, more people died from drug overdoses than at any other time in U.S. history, with 60% of fatalities involving opioid drugs.

Addiction to opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and prescription pain relievers, is notoriously difficult to overcome as withdrawal symptoms are debilitating and often lead to re-use of the addictive compounds.

Now, a neurobiologist at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai has just released data from a small human pilot study that shows cannabinoids, extracts of cannabis legally sold as medical marijuana, could reduce cravings and ease withdrawal symptoms in heroin users. The findings from this new study were published recently in Trends in Neuroscience in an article entitled  Cannabidiol: Swinging the Marijuana Pendulum From  Weed  to Medication to Treat the Opioid Epidemic. 

While both cannabinoids and opioids regulate the perception of pain, the two drugs affect different parts of the brain and how the sensation is communicated from neuron to neuron. Over the years, researchers have found that this means cannabinoids, for example, have a stronger effect on inflammation-based chronic pain. Conversely, opioids are particularly good at relieving acute pain, which is why they are used in surgery. However, the problem is that opioids can quickly lead to a deadly addiction.

""If you look at both drugs and where their receptors are, opioids are much more dangerous, in part because of the potential for overdose the opioid receptors are very abundant in the brainstem area that regulates our respiration, so they shut down the breathing center if opioid doses are high,"" explained senior study investigator Yasmin Hurd, Ph.D., professor and director of the Center for Addictive Disorders within the Mount Sinai Behavioral Health System. ""Cannabinoids don't do that. They have a much wider window of therapeutic benefit without causing an overdose in adults.""

In recent years, animal studies have supported the hypothesis that cannabinoids could have long-lasting therapeutic effects. A specific cannabinoid, cannabidiol, has been shown to reduce heroin cravings in animals more than a week after abstinence and seems to restore some of the neurobiological damage induced by opioid use. In the current study, Dr. Hurd mirrored the findings seen in rodents. Interestingly, she found that cannabidiol particularly helped to relieve anxiety related to cravings in heroin users abstaining from use.

Unfortunately, politicians are only now beginning to acknowledge that an epidemic of opioid overdoses is taking place across the United States, particularly in suburban and rural areas, and the National Institute on Drug Abuse is asking researchers to think creatively about new strategies for pain relief. Over the years, marijuana has been a neglected option due to heavy restrictions on studying its effects in humans. While there has been a growing interest by the scientific community in cannabinoids since the legalization of medical marijuana, there is still much researchers don t know about how it could be used therapeutically, despite at least a million people having prescriptions.

""We have to be open to marijuana because there are components of the plant that seem to have therapeutic properties, but without empirical-based research or clinical trials, we're letting anecdotes guide how people vote and policies that are going to be made,"" Dr. Hurd concluded. ""It's one of the first times in our history that we're making laypeople and politicians decide whether things are medicinal or not. If we want to say something is medical marijuana, we have to prove that it is medicinal.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The new molecular construction method, unveiled in a Science online First Release paper (""Formation of  -Chiral Centers by Asymmetric  -C(sp3) H Arylation, Alkenylation, and Alkynylation""), reportedly represents a significant milestone in chiral chemistry. It creates a structure that chemists call an  -chiral center, thereby enabling the synthesis of a great variety of potentially valuable chiral drugs and other products.

At the same time, unlike most previous chirality inducing reactions, it requires only inexpensive and widely available starting chemicals, according to its inventors.

""This method essentially mimics the ability of the enzymes in our cells to turn simple organic molecules into chiral molecules,"" said senior author Jin-Quan Yu, Ph.D., Frank and Bertha Hupp Professor in the department of chemistry at TSRI.

Over the past decade or so, Dr. Yu and his laboratory have invented a number of new molecule-building reactions that have been adopted by chemists in academia and industry. Most are C H activation reactions, which remove a hydrogen atom from one of the carbon atoms of the molecular backbone and replace it with a more complex cluster of atoms called a functional group. Increasingly, Dr. Yu and his colleagues have designed these reactions to create the asymmetry needed for chiral drugs.

In a paper in Science last August, for example, they described a set of chiral asymmetry-making reactions that work by selectively activating just one of the two hydrogen atoms on a methylene group (CH ), a feature of many organic molecules. Like most of the C H activations developed by the Yu laboratory, this reaction employs a palladium atom to break the targeted C H bond and a special ligand molecule to steer the palladium atom precisely where it needs to go.

The new set of reactions has an even more challenging target: a cluster of carbon and hydrogen atoms known as an isopropyl group, another feature of many organic molecules. The ligands developed for the reaction, derivatives of aminomethyl oxazoline, effectively select a carbon at just one side of the isopropyl group and replace one of its hydrogen atoms with a functional group.

Dr. Yu's team showed that they can use the ligands to add aryl, alkene, and alkyne functional groups, common building blocks in the construction of drug molecules.

The intended starting material for the new reactions is the bis(isopropyl)-bearing molecule isobutyric acid, although the reactions also work well on related molecules. Isobutyric acid is cheaply produced in very large quantities using standard industrial methods, and it can also can be generated from waste biomass, such as crushed sugar cane, making it a more environmentally friendly ingredient for chemical reactions.

Isobutyric acid is also found in nature, and bacteria and other organisms have evolved enzymes that convert it to natural chiral molecules. In the past few decades, pharmaceutical chemists have learned to harness some of these natural enzyme reactions using genetically engineered bacteria to help them build chiral drug molecules. However, these enzyme-driven reactions are restricted to isobutyric acid as a starting molecule and are very limited in the chiral molecules they can yield. The new ligand/catalyst, while essentially mimicking nature's synthetic feat, is much more versatile.

""Now that we know how to selectively break that one C H bond with a palladium catalyst, we're not limited to the reactions that enzymes can do,"" Dr. Yu said.

He added that researchers at Bristol-Myers Squibb, which has a research collaboration agreement with the Yu laboratory, are already using the new reactions to make potential new drug molecules.

Human skin cells can be reprogrammed to become NSCs. Also, these cells can be engineered to secrete a prodrug-activating protein. Ultimately, these cells are compatible with patient tissue but hostile toward brain tumors, report scientists from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. These scientists recently completed a study demonstrating that induced human NSCs (iNSCs) can hunt down and kill human brain cancer.

The scientists provided detailed findings February 1 in the journal Science Translational Medicine, in an article entitled,  Tumor-Homing Cytotoxic Human Induced Neural Stem Cells for Cancer Therapy.  The article describes a critical step toward clinical trials and a real treatment.

The transdifferentiation process used by the scientists took only 4 days to complete. This kind of speed is necessary, the scientists indicated, because they have in mind generating iNSCs quickly enough to treat patients afflicted with glioblastoma (GBM), a common and aggressive brain cancer. For GBM patients, median survival is less than 18 months, and a chance of surviving beyond 2 years is just 30%.

""Speed is essential,"" said Shawn Hingtgen, Ph.D., an assistant professor who led the UNC-Chapel Hill team. ""It used to take weeks to convert human skin cells to stem cells. But brain cancer patients don't have weeks and months to wait for us to generate these therapies. The new process we developed to create these stem cells is fast enough and simple enough to be used to treat a patient.""

In the current study, the scientists engineered the NSCs they generated to deliver two different types of therapies. The scientists also demonstrated that these engineered cells could infiltrate and effectively treat brain tumors in multiple mouse models.

 We transdifferentiated (TD) human fibroblasts into tumor-homing early-stage induced NSCs (h-iNSCTE), engineered them to express optical reporters and different therapeutic gene products, and assessed the tumor-homing migration and therapeutic efficacy of cytotoxic h-iNSCTE in patient-derived GBM models of surgical and nonsurgical disease,  wrote the authors.  Time-lapse motion analysis showed that h-iNSCTE rapidly migrated to human GBM cells and penetrated human GBM spheroids. 

 Serial imaging showed that h-iNSCTE delivery of the proapoptotic agent tumor necrosis factor   related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) reduced the size of solid human GBM xenografts 250-fold in 3 weeks and prolonged median survival from 22 to 49 days,  the authors continued.  Additionally, h-iNSCTE thymidine kinase/ganciclovir enzyme/prodrug therapy (h-iNSCTE TK) reduced the size of patient-derived GBM xenografts 20-fold and extended survival from 32 to 62 days. 

Surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy are the standard of care for GBM, and that hasn't changed in three decades. In months, the tumor comes back in almost every single patient, invariably sending tiny tendrils out into the surrounding brain tissue. Drugs can't reach them, and surgeons can't see them, so it's almost impossible to remove all of the cancer, explained Ryan Miller, M.D., Ph.D., a co-author of the study and neuropathologist at UNC Hospitals and associate professor at the UNC School of Medicine.

""We desperately need something better,"" said Hingtgen.

The key to Hingtgen's treatment is ""skin flipping,"" a technology for creating NSCs from skin cells that won Shinya Yamanaka, Ph.D., and Sir John Gurdon a Nobel Prize in 2012. The first step is to harvest fibroblasts skin cells responsible for producing collagen and connective tissue from the patient and reprogram those cells to become what are called iNSCs, which have an innate ability to home in on cancer cells in the brain.

But by themselves, stem cells can only find a tumor and bump up against it not kill it so the team had to engineer stem cells that could carry therapeutic agents that the cells can launch at the tumor to kill it.

Hingtgen's stem cells can carry a protein that activates an inert substance called a prodrug that is given to the patient. The cells can then generate a small halo of drug that is located just around the stem cell, rather than it being circulated throughout the patient's body, reducing unwanted side effects.

""We're 1 to 2 years away from clinical trials, but for the first time, we showed that our strategy for treating glioblastoma works with human stem cells and human cancers,"" said Hingtgen. ""This is a big step toward a real treatment and making a real difference.""","Pharmaceuticals"

JHMI said it joined the Janssen Disease Interception Accelerator to launch a partnership with DayTwo and the Weizmann Institute of Science in Rehovot, Israel, aimed at treating metabolic disorders through microbiome-based solutions.

Janssen said it will work with DayTwo and the Weizmann Institute on their first-in-class microbiome-based platform, designed to provide users with nutritional recommendations to control glucose response. These solutions are to be evaluated for effective interception of gestational diabetes mellitus, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and metabolic syndrome-associated disorders, JHMI said.

Separately, JHMI and the Weizmann Institute are partnering to mine human microbiome datasets for identification and validation of microbiome-based pharmaceutical therapies, applying Weizmann s research and analytics expertise. These efforts are based on the synergistic collaboration of two Weizmann researchers, Eran Segal, Ph.D., of the computer science and applied mathematics department, and Eran Elinav, M.D., Ph.D., of the immunology department.

JHMI said it has also offered scientific support to Caelus Health (Caelus), which has become a portfolio company of Johnson & Johnson Innovation JJDC with support from the life sciences investment firm Bioqube Ventures. Bioqube teamed up with J&J Innovation last year to launch the JLINX initiative based at the Janssen R&D Campus in Beerse, Belgium. Caelus was one of the first companies to join JLINX, which nurtures early-stage companies by providing access to resources to grow and network across the European life science ecosystem.

Caelus aims to advance the clinical development of pharmaceutical products based on insights in humans for the treatment of obesity-associated type 2 diabetes and cardiometabolic complications. Caelus received an equity investment by JJDC and will have access to capabilities at JLINX.

JHMI added that it will dedicate computational resources to Caelus to examine large, unique human datasets to inform the identification of future microbiome-based interventions. JHMI global head Dirk Gevers, Ph.D., will join Caelus  Scientific Advisory Board.

 DayTwo's advanced prediction engine algorithm, the Weizmann Institute of Science's robust research capabilities, and Caelus's portfolio of microbiota-based products provide unique opportunities to learn more about the role that the microbiome plays in disease and health,  Anuk Das, Ph.D., JHMI s head of scientific innovation, said in a statement.

DayTwo, the Weizmann Institute, and Caelus join JHMI's network of collaborators, which includes the Center for Microbiome Innovation at University of California, San Diego, and the lab of Jeremiah Faith, Ph.D., assistant professor of genetics and genomics science and clinical immunology at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Mini-Brains Created that Grow Blood Vessels","Scientists at Brown University report that they have created 3D neural cell cultures of mini-brains that grow blood vessels.&#160;The networks of capillaries within the small balls of nervous system cells could enable new kinds of large-scale lab investigations into diseases, such as stroke or concussion, where the interaction between the brain and its circulatory system is paramount, said Diane Hoffman-Kim, Ph.D., senior author of the study (&quot;A Three-Dimensional Neural Spheroid Model for Capillary-Like Network Formation&quot;) that appears&#160;in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods.&#160;

The networks of capillaries within the small balls of nervous system cells could enable new kinds of large-scale lab investigations into diseases, such as stroke or concussion, where the interaction between the brain and its circulatory system is paramount, said Diane Hoffman-Kim, Ph.D., senior author of the study (""A Three-Dimensional Neural Spheroid Model for Capillary-Like Network Formation"") that appears in the Journal of Neuroscience Methods.

""This is exciting because real brains have vasculature,"" said Dr. Hoffman-Kim, an associate professor of medical science and of engineering at Brown. ""We rely on it. For our neurons to do their thing, they have to be close to some blood vessels. If we are going to study lab models of the brain, we would love for them to have vasculature, too.""

Dr. Hoffman-Kim's lab first described its mini-brain method in 2015. While the engineered tissues appeared relatively simple compared to some others, they were also relatively easy and inexpensive to make. But what had remained unnoticed at the time, even by the inventors, was that the little 8000-cell spheres cultured from mouse cells were capable of growing an elementary circulatory system.

Only as members of the lab, including lead author and Brown Graduate School alumna Molly Boutin, Ph.D., continued to work with and study the mini-brains did they discover that after about day 3 of culture, about two-thirds of the mini-brains had grown networks of nonneural tissue, according to Dr. Hoffman-Kim. Closer inspection revealed that these tangles of spaghetti were self-assembled tubes made of the cells and proteins found in blood vessels.

The new study features a variety of imaging experiments in which staining and fluorescence techniques reveal those different cell types and proteins within the mini-brain spheres. The study also documents their integration with the neural tissues. Cross-sections under a transmission electron microscope, meanwhile, show that the capillaries are indeed hollow tubes that could transport blood.

Of course, there is no blood in a tiny mini-brain, Dr. Hoffman-Kim said. They exist in an agarose well plate, not in a living animal. But she's currently working with a colleague at Brown to design a way to connect the mini-brains with a microfluidic apparatus that could produce an external source of circulation through a mini-brain. The capillary networks are not as dense as they would be in a real brain, she acknowledged, and the study also shows that they don't last longer than about a week or two.

Aware of both their constraints and their potential, Dr. Hoffman-Kim says her lab has already started experiments to take advantage of the presence of vasculature. Study second author Liana Kramer, a Brown senior, has begun looking at what happens to the vasculature and neural cells when mini-brains are deprived of oxygen or glucose. Later, that same test bed could be used to examine the difference that different drugs or other treatments make.

Vasculature is particularly important not only because it delivers oxygen, glucose, and medicine to brain cells, but also because research shows that in strokes, Alzheimer's disease, and brain injury, the brain sometimes attempts to redesign its vasculature to compensate for what's happening to it. The mini-brains could allow researchers to observe such responses amid different lab-created conditions and treatments, notes Dr. Hoffman-Kim.

""We can study a range of injury conditions, several drugs that are being tested, and several conditions, such as stroke and diabetes, together,"" she explained.","Pharmaceuticals"

To what may the heterogeneity of childhood cancers be ascribed, if not genetic diversity? Epigenetic diversity, suggests a team of scientists based at the CeMM Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Sciences.

The CeMM-led team recently completed a study of Ewing sarcoma, an aggressive bone cancer in children and adolescents. A single genetic defect the EWS-ETS fusion is present in all tumors, initiating cancer development and defining Ewing sarcoma as a disease. But the tumors carry very few DNA mutations that could explain the observed differences in the disease course of Ewing sarcoma patients.

After profiling many Ewing tumors, the scientists found that the disease's clinical diversity is reflected by widespread epigenetic heterogeneity. The scientists presented their results January 30 in the journal Nature Medicine, in an article entitled  DNA Methylation Heterogeneity Defines a Disease Spectrum in Ewing Sarcoma. 

The article described how the scientists performed genome-scale DNA methylation sequencing for a large cohort of Ewing sarcoma tumors and analyzed epigenetic heterogeneity on three levels between cancers, between tumors, and within tumors.

 We observed consistent DNA hypomethylation at enhancers regulated by the disease-defining EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, thus establishing epigenomic enhancer reprogramming as a ubiquitous and characteristic feature of Ewing sarcoma,  the authors of the Nature Medicine article wrote.  DNA methylation differences between tumors identified a continuous disease spectrum underlying Ewing sarcoma, which reflected the strength of an EWS-FLI1 regulatory signature and a continuum between mesenchymal and stem cell signatures. 

The scientists established that there is substantial epigenetic heterogeneity within Ewing sarcoma tumors, particularly in patients with metastatic disease. Moreover, the researchers found that Ewing sarcoma tumors appear to retain part of the characteristic DNA methylation patterns of their cell of origin.

The scientists suggest that the diverse clinical courses observed among Ewing sarcoma patients may be explained epigenetically: As DNA methylation influences gene activity, the combination of Ewing sarcoma specific and cell-of-origin specific patterns can lead to different outcomes. The epigenetic diversity also appears to correlate with the tumors' aggressiveness and metastatic state.

Regarding the future of Ewing sarcoma treatment, study co-director Heinrich Kovar, scientific director of St. Anna Children's Cancer Research Institute, optimistically stated: ""These new insights into the biology of Ewing sarcoma provide the basis for developing epigenetic biomarkers that can reliably predict disease course and therapy response. After two decades of stagnation in the therapy for patients with Ewing sarcoma, we expect new impulses for personalized therapy of this aggressive cancer.""

""Our findings in Ewing sarcoma also provide an interesting concept for other cancer with low genetic complexity,"" added Christoph Bock, principal investigator at CeMM and a co-director and corresponding author of the current study. ""In the era of precision medicine, understanding the causes and consequences of tumor heterogeneity will be crucial to develop personalized therapies. Only with precise knowledge of the molecular mechanisms underlying each tumor can we hope to treat in a targeted way and with far fewer side effects.""","Pharmaceuticals"

This collaboration with Astellas represents the power of the GRID database the ability to share and analyze what used to be incomprehensible amounts of genomic data to provide a better understanding of how individual patients respond to treatment. 

Added Bruce Brown, M.D., senior medical director, oncology, Astellas:  The genomic data provided by GenomeDx will help us to better understand the molecular drivers of prostate cancer and how those drivers interact with response to enzalutamide. 

Decipher GRID contains genomic profiles of thousands of tumors from patients with urological cancers, and according to GenomeDx is the largest shared genomic expression database in urologic cancer as well as one of the world's largest global RNA expression databases using cloud-based analytics.

Decipher Prostate Cancer Classifier tests are commercially available genomic tests derived from GRID that are designed to provide a genomic assessment of tumor aggressiveness for individual patients. The tests include Decipher Biopsy, indicated for men with localized prostate cancer at diagnosis, and Decipher Post-Op, indicated for men after prostate removal surgery.

Each tumor analyzed with a Decipher test adds new data to the GRID database that is then compiled into a Decipher GRID Profile that may reveal additional biological characteristics of the tumor for ongoing research purposes. GenomeDx says Decipher and GRID are designed to make genetic information accessible for researchers, in order to predict responses to therapy better and guide treatment more precisely.","Pharmaceuticals"

CRISPR technology has become widely used in the laboratory in recent years as it is an accurate and relatively easy way to modify the genetic code. However, sometimes unintentional changes to the genetic code occur as an off-target effect, so finding ways to reduce these is a priority for genomics research.

 When you want to insert a new gene into a mammalian genome, the difficulty can be finding the best place within the genome to insert the gene,  Dr. Zhang noted.  You have to hunt through the genome, looking for a region that you think will have the least impact on other genes that are in close proximity. We employed a meticulous and methodological approach to identify the best-suited region for gene insertion, which we show has no detectable off target effects on the bovine genome.

She is responsible for discovering ADNP, a gene that is dysregulated in Alzheimer's. Mutations in ADNP that occur in pregnancy are a major cause of autism with intellectual disability.

""ADNP and NAP operate through the stabilization of microtubules tubes within the cell that maintain cellular shape,"" Dr. Gozes said. ""They transport biological material. These microtubules break down in in Alzheimer's disease and may be dysfunctional in autism. NAP works to protect the microtubules, thereby protecting the cell.

Greg Walden (R-OR), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, during the meeting, characterized by the administration as a  listening session.  While hearing industry concerns, the president also pressed for biopharmas to repatriate to the U.S. operations that have been shifted to lower-tax countries overseas.

In statements yesterday, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA) and Biotechnology Innovation Organization (BIO) emphasized areas of agreement with Trump while pledging to resolve differences.

 We discussed many areas of common ground, including: Advancing stronger trade agreements to level the playing field with countries around the world; reforming our tax code to spur investment and job creation here in the United States; and removing outdated regulations that drive up costs and slow innovation,  PhRMA president and CEO Stephen J. Ubl said.

 We believe if these policies are enacted, it will translate to up to 350,000 new jobs over the next 10 years as a result of growth in the biopharmaceutical industry,  Ubl added.

That would amount to a 41% increase in jobs directly within the industry, based on the 854,000 jobs counted by PhRMA across biopharma, according to the group s website. Employment swells to about 4.4 million jobs when  indirect  positions are included.

Ubl also pledged to cooperate with Trump s administration on addressing the president s key complaint about biopharma the sky-high and rising price of new medicines.

 You folks have done a terrific job over the years, but we have to get prices down for a lot of reasons. We have no choice. For Medicare, for Medicaid, we have to get the prices way down,  Trump told the biopharma leaders, according to highlights of the meeting posted on The White House s website.  U.S. drug companies have produced extraordinary results for our country, but the pricing has been astronomical for our country. 

Until now, industry has blamed high drug prices on the need to recoup high development costs. In March 2016, the Tufts Center for the Study of Drug Development updated its development cost estimate for a new drug to $2.558 billion through approval climbing to $2.87 billion when post-approval studies are figured in. However, others have offered much higher, and lower, cost estimates for drug development.

Trump blamed high drug development costs on the time and expense of FDA regulations and promised the industry that changes were on the way.

 We re going to streamline the FDA,  Trump declared.  We have a fantastic person that I think I we ll be naming fairly soon. He s going to streamline the FDA and you're going to get your products either approved or not approved but it's going to be a quick process. It s not going to take 15 years. 

Responded Ubl:  Our industry takes seriously the concerns raised about the affordability and accessibility of prescription medicines, and we have expressed our commitment to working with the administration to advance market-based reforms. 

Those reforms, say PhRMA and BIO, should promote pricing based on the value of treatments to patients, as well as offer incentives toward greater entrepreneurial risk, especially for smaller companies.

 The vast majority of our member companies are entrepreneurial startups working on cutting-edge research and development that is leading the way to the next generation of biomedical breakthroughs and cures,  BIO stated.  They rely heavily on massive amounts of private capital, invested over a decade or more, to do the incredible work that they do and therefore are particularly sensitive to changes in public policy that can increase the risk of such investments.  We are pleased that the President clearly understands this dynamic. 

BIO indirectly urged against cost curbs by citing the industry s clinical as well as commercial success without them. During the presidential campaign, Trump decried the price of drugs while Hillary Clinton called for containing drug price increases following the 5000% hike in the price of toxoplasmosis drug Daraprim  by Turing Pharmaceuticals and then-CEO Martin Shkreli a prospect that touched off an investor sell-off of shares in biopharmas.

 Policies that incentivize biomedical innovation, reward risk-taking, and avoid heavy-handed price controls have allowed America's biopharmaceutical companies to produce more new cures and treatments than the rest of the world combined. They have made the U.S. biopharmaceutical industry an engine of economic growth and good jobs,  BIO stated.  Our industry has only scratched the surface of what is possible when it comes to improving the lives of patients and transforming our nation's healthcare system. We look forward to building on our proven track record in the coming years. 

PhRMA and Ubl urged Trump to instead pursue reforms that allow companies to negotiate payment deals for treatments  based on the value they provide to patients and our healthcare system. We look forward to working with the administration and Congress to advance solutions that promote economic growth and job creation and create a more competitive health care marketplace.

Kevzara will be marketed in Canada by Sanofi Genzyme. Approval was based on data from the global, 2900-patient SARIL-RA program of pivotal studies evaluating sarilumab either alone, or in combination with conventional DMARDs, in patients with moderately to severely active RA who had an inadequate response to previous treatment regimens.

Roche s IL-6R-targeting biologic Actemra /RoActemra (tocilizumab) was the first anti-IL-6R biologic to be approved for treating RA, back in 2010, and achieved sales of CHF 1.7 billion (about $1.7 billion) in 2016, a 16% increase on 2015 sales.

Previous studies focused on neurons. The new study, however, looked at microglia, a type of immune cell located throughout the brain and spinal cord

Details of the study appeared January 30 in the journal Nature Medicine, in an article entitled,  Blocking Microglial Pannexin-1 Channels Alleviates Morphine Withdrawal in Rodents.  This article describes how the University of Calgary scientists, led by Tuan Trang, Ph.D., identified the Panx1 channel as a therapeutic target in opiate withdrawal.

 We show that withdrawal from morphine induces long-term synaptic facilitation in lamina I and II neurons within the rodent spinal dorsal horn, a principal site of action for opiate analgesia,  wrote the article s authors.  Genetic ablation of Panx1 in microglia abolished the spinal synaptic facilitation and ameliorated the sequelae of morphine withdrawal. 

The discovery represents a key shift in understanding how withdrawal occurs and it opens the door to treatments that could have tremendous therapeutic potential.

Once the scientists identified the mechanism, the researchers were able to test an existing drug in this case an antigout medication called probenecid that is known to have nonselective Panx1 blocking effects. The drug is relatively inexpensive and has few side-effects. Importantly, the researchers were also able to demonstrate that the drug did not affect the opioid's ability to relieve pain.

 We show that Panx1 activation drives ATP [adenosine triphosphate] release from microglia during morphine withdrawal and that degrading endogenous spinal ATP by administering apyrase produces a reduction in withdrawal behaviors,  detailed the authors.  Conversely, we found that pharmacological inhibition of ATP breakdown exacerbates withdrawal. Treatment with a Panx1-blocking peptide (10panx) or the clinically used broad-spectrum Panx1 blockers, mefloquine or probenecid, suppressed ATP release and reduced withdrawal severity. 

With such encouraging preclinical results, the researchers quickly started looking at how to translate this discovery to humans. They are already moving forward with Lori Montgomery, M.D., and Chris Spanswick, M.D., at the Calgary Pain Clinic to design a clinical trial.

""We now need to look to see if this works with patients as well as ensure safety,"" said Dr. Spanswick, medical leader of the Calgary Pain Program. ""We are at the very early stages of organizing clinical research. It will be some time before this research gets off the ground and we look forward to continuing collaboration with the HBI on this and other areas of research.""

""Opioids are the pharmacological cornerstone for treating chronic pain in a large variety of diseases,"" noted Dr. Trang. ""Understanding why opioid withdrawal occurs and how to alleviate it, is of critical importance in improving pain therapy and may have implications for substance abuse in opioid addicts. The potential impact is immense.""

The study led by Dr. Trang effectively alleviated withdrawal symptoms in rodents, which could have important implications for patients that may wish to decrease or stop their use of these medications. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 91 Americans die every day from an opioid overdose, whether from prescription opioids or heroin.","Pharmaceuticals"

""If we're able to break down the distinct cellular components of a tumor, we can target the cancer much more precisely.""

This new study demonstrates a method of barcoding cells multiple times and then sequencing them. The method greatly expands the number of single cells that can be mapped. The findings from this study were published recently in Nature Methods in an article entitled  Sequencing Thousands of Single-Cell Genomes with Combinatorial Indexing. 

 We present single-cell combinatorial indexed sequencing (SCI-seq) as a means of simultaneously generating thousands of low-pass single-cell libraries for detection of somatic copy-number variants,  the authors wrote.

But the picture of how that DNA is loaded into those capsids was blurry, especially for two of the most common types of DNA viruses on earth, bacterial viruses and human herpesvirus.

Scientists at Thomas Jefferson University say they have pieced together the three-dimensional atomic structure of a doughnut-shaped protein that acts like a door or ""portal"" for the DNA to get in and out of the capsid, and have now discovered that this protein begins to transform its structure when it comes into contact with DNA. Their study (""Portal Protein Functions Akin to a DNA-Sensor That Couples Genome-Packaging to Icosahedral Capsid Maturation"") is published in Nature Communications.

""Researchers thought that the portal protein acts as an inert passageway for DNA,"" says senior author Gino Cingolani, Ph.D., a professor in the department of biochemistry and molecular biology at Thomas Jefferson University and researcher at the Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center. ""We have shown that the portal is much more like a sensor that essentially helps measure out an appropriate length of DNA for each capsid particle, ensuring faithful production of new viral particles.""

The finding solves a longstanding puzzle in the field and reveals a potential drug target for one of the most common human viral pathogens, herpesviruses, which is responsible for diseases such as chicken pox, mononucleosis, lymphomas, and Kaposi sarcoma.

Dr. Cingolani and colleagues started their work 18 years ago by characterizing the structure of the portal protein using X-ray crystallography from P22, a bacteria-infecting virus that has a nearly identical portal protein as the human-infecting herpesviruses. In a paper published in 2011, the group showed that the portal protein looked like a perfect doughnut on a pedestal, with 12-fold rotational symmetry. Paradoxically, though, the protein wasn't very good at binding to DNA, which should have been an essential ability, the researchers thought.

""We figured the portal protein we had studied for over a decade must be an end-stage, or mature version, of a more plastic and dynamic molecular machine,"" says Dr. Cingolani. ""And that it must also adopt other conformations earlier in viral assembly that have the capacity to bind both DNA and other motor proteins, or terminases.""

Proteins can change structure and hence their function and biochemical activity many times before reaching their final mature state. While these intermediate states are unstable and sometimes exist for tiny fractions of a second, they can also have important functions.

In the current paper, Dr. Cingolani and colleagues describe their success in identifying and characterizing an immature state of the portal protein, of which they determined the three-dimensional structure down to the atomic level. Unlike the mature final-stage protein that was profoundly symmetric, this immature conformation of portal protein is surprisingly asymmetric and has the ability to bind strongly to both the motor and the DNA itself.

""We think that DNA binds to the immature portal protein and wraps around it like a python as it enters the viral capsid with the help of the motor protein. This DNA stranglehold causes the portal protein to begin to transform into its final symmetric state that because of its weak binding will ultimately release both the DNA and the motor, cutting off the DNA-loading at an appropriate length,"" explains Dr. Cingolani. ""It's a completely novel mechanism for sensing DNA. It's a conformational change from asymmetric to symmetric that's completely unexpected, yet makes perfect sense.""

In addition, the portal protein is unique to viruses, which makes it, in all of its various forms, a potentially good drug target. Because some herpesviruses infect and lay dormant in human cells until they reawaken by stress, developing a therapy that could interfere with viral production at different levels could prove a useful therapeutic strategy.

""It took us 18 years to understand that the portal protein functions by existing in two states that turn the viral DNA packaging on and off by changing its structure. At 18, it feels like this story has come of age along with the research,"" adds Dr. Cingolani.","Pharmaceuticals"

 As an organization with a strong focus on oncology innovation, our agreement with Exelixis brings a promising and well-studied solid-tumor therapy to our pipeline that may help patients in Japan suffering from RCC and potentially other equally devastating cancers,  said Tsudoi Miyoshi, head of Takeda s Japan Oncology Business Unit.  We intend to pursue regulatory approval for RCC indications as soon as we re able, and look forward to commencing the local clinical trial program to further strengthen the clinical profile of cabozantinib. 

Takeda and Exelixis will work together on clinical development of cabozantinib for the Japanese market. This will include leveraging existing clinical data and results from ongoing and planned pivotal and earlier-stage studies in a range of tumor types, including hepatocellular cancer, colorectal cancer, bladder cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer, and endometrial cancer. More than 45 studies are anticipated through the National Cancer Institute s Cancer Therapy Evaluation Program and investigator-sponsored trials.

 We look forward to supporting our new partner as it pursues Japanese regulatory approval for cabozantinib, while simultaneously working together to plan the next steps for clinical development in the country,  added Michael M. Morrissey, Ph.D., Exelixis president and CEO.  This agreement further propels the global progress for cabozantinib development and commercialization, which now includes the recent first commercial sale of Cabometyx in the United Kingdom, triggering a $10 million milestone payment from Ipsen to Exelixis. 

Cabozantinib was approved in the U.S. in April 2016 and in the EU in September 2016 for treating advanced RCC in patients who have received previous antiangiogenic treatment. Also during September, the firm reported positive data from the Phase II Cabosun study evaluating cabozantinib in patients with previously untreated advanced RCC. The trial results showed that cabozantinib therapy in comparison with sunitinib reduced the rate of diseases progression or death by 31%.

Cabozantinib development has not been straightforward for Exelixis. Back in 2014, the drug bombed in its pivotal trial for the initial indication of metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC), forcing Exelixis to axe 70% of its workforce in a bid to conserve the cash needed to complete Phase III RCC development.

Takeda has started 2017 with a string of collaborations, license agremeents, and M&A deals, topped by its agreed $5.2 billion acquisition of Ariad Pharmaceuticals. Also in January, Takeda inked an epilepsy drug collaboration with Ovid Pharmaceuticals, announced a partnership with LegoChem to evaluate next-generation antibody drug conjugates, and negotiated an option to acquire Maverick Therapeutics as part of a T-cell redirection therapy collaboration. At the start of January, Takeda agreed to fund development of PvP Biologics' celiac therapeutic KumaMax.","Pharmaceuticals"

A paper about the new material will be published in Science Robotics on Wednesday.

While fabricating synthetic woods in a petri dish, a team led by Caltech's Chiara Daraio, Ph.D., created a material that exhibited an electrical response to temperature changes in the lab. It turned out that the component responsible for the temperature sensitivity was pectin, a long-chain molecule present in plant cell walls.

""Pectin is widely used in the food industry as a jellifying agent; it's what you use to make jam. So it's easy to obtain and also very cheap,"" says Dr. Daraio, professor of mechanical engineering and applied physics in the Division of Engineering and Applied Science.

The team shifted its attention to pectin and ultimately created a thin, transparent flexible film of pectin and water, which can be as little as 20  m thick (equivalent to the diameter of a human hair). Pectin molecules in the film have a weakly bonded double-strand structure that contains calcium ions. As temperature increases, these bonds break down and the double strands ""unzip,"" releasing the positively charged calcium ions.

Either the increased concentration of free calcium ions or their increased mobility (likely both, the researchers speculate) results in a decrease in the electrical resistance throughout the material, which can be detected with a multimeter connected to electrodes embedded in the film.

The film senses temperature using a mechanism similar but not identical to the pit organs in vipers, which allows the snakes to sense warm prey in the dark by detecting radiated heat. In those organs, ion channels in the cell membrane of sensory nerve fibers expand as temperature increases. This dilation allows calcium ions to flow, triggering electrical impulses.

Existing electronic skins can sense temperature changes of less than a tenth of a degree Celsius across a 5-degree temperature range. The new skin can sense changes that are an order of magnitude smaller and have a responsivity that is two orders of magnitude larger than those of other electronic skins over a 45-degree temperature range.

So far, the skin is capable of detecting these tiny changes across a range of temperatures roughly between 5 to 50 degrees Celsius (about 41 to 158 degrees Fahrenheit), which is useful for robotics and biomedical applications. Next, Dr. Daraio's team would like to boost that up to 90 degrees Celsius (194 degrees Fahrenheit). This would make pectin sensors useful for industrial applications, such as thermal sensors in consumer electronics or robotic skins to augment human robot interactions. To do so, they will need to change the fabrication process they now use to create the material, as that process leads to the presence of water, which tends to bubble or evaporate at high temperatures.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Shark Immunity Evolved to Efficiently Resist Cancer","It has been known for a number of years that sharks and rays are highly efficient wound healers and suspected to show a greater resistance to cancers properties that are likely tied to their immune systems, which have been fine-tuned over 400 million years of evolution. Now, a new genomics study of shark DNA by investigators at the Nova Southeastern University (NSU) Save Our Seas Shark Research Center, Guy Harvey Research Institute (GHRI), and the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine reveals unique modifications in shark immunity genes that may underlie the rapid wound healing and possibly higher resistance to cancers in these ocean predators.

The findings from this study were published recently in BMC Genomics in an article entitled  Comparative Transcriptomics of Elasmobranchs and Teleosts Highlight Important Processes in Adaptive Immunity and Regional Endothermy. 

""The immune system of sharks and rays has been battle-tested and evolved over hundreds of millions of years,"" explained lead study investigator Mahmood Shivji, Ph.D., director of NSU's Save Our Seas Shark Research Center and Guy Harvey Research Institute. ""Using genomics approaches to understanding their immunity genesis is likely to produce many more exciting discoveries, some of which could potentially translate into a human medical benefit. Now we have another important reason to make sure we don't lose these marvelous and ecologically critical animals to overfishing, as is currently occurring in many parts of the world. We've just scratched the surface regarding learning what these ancient animals can teach us, as well as possibly provide us in terms of direct biomedical benefits.""

The new study provides the first evidence that some shark and ray immunity genes have undergone evolutionary changes that may be tied to these novel immune system abilities. In particular, the researchers found that two shark immune genes, legumain, and Bag1, stood out. Both these genes have counterparts in humans, where their overexpression is well known to be associated with a whole range of cancers. However, the new research shows that these genes in sharks have become modified and have undergone evolutionary natural selection.

""Several studies have demonstrated antitumor properties of shark-derived compounds in lab studies,  Dr. Shivji noted. ""It's intriguing that we are now seeing evidence of evolutionary adaptation in these specific shark immunity genes, which just happen also to be involved in promoting cancer in humans.""

Interestingly, the uniqueness of the shark immune system is even more vast. The shark DNA sequences provide further clues that might explain the rapid wound-healing abilities of sharks while immersed in seawater with its myriads of bacteria, which would be expected to quickly cause infections in open wounds. The researchers found that compared to bony fishes, the four species of sharks and ray examined not only had a much higher proportion of genes involved in antibody-mediated immunity but also that several of the infection immunity-related genes were expressed only in the sharks and rays.

""This higher proportion of genes involved in adaptive (antibody) immunity function could be a key reason behind the infection-fighting and fast wound-healing abilities of sharks and rays,"" concluded co-senior study investigator Michael Stanhope, Ph.D., professor in the department of population medicine and diagnostic sciences at the Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine. ""Previous studies of the shark immune system have already yielded some surprises in terms of antibody structure, and these new genetic findings further add to the box of biological novelties in this highly successful vertebrate lineage.""","Pharmaceuticals"
"Stem Cell Exosomes Convey Hope for Cell-Free Glaucoma Treatment","Ideally, a stem cell therapy wouldn t require the actual administration of stem cells. Even stem cells that secrete helpful compounds can lead to complications. For example, stem cells can lead to immune rejection and unwanted cell growth. 
 
	In hopes of avoiding such complications in stem cell therapies meant to protect against glaucoma and other eye diseases, scientists based at the National Eye Institute decided that they take a closer look at stem cells.

They also knew that these MSCs secrete exosomes, membrane-enclosed vesicles containing proteins, messenger RNA (mRNA), and microRNA (miRNA). Could these exosomes, Drs. Mead and Tomarev, wondered, account for the protective effects of MSCs?

The scientists decided to investigate whether exosomes released by MSCs could be taken up by retinal ganglion cells, which form the optic nerve that carries visual information from the eye to the brain. The death of retinal ganglion cells leads to vision loss in glaucoma and other optic neuropathies.

When exosomes merge with a target cells, the contents of the exosomes may spur the cell to make new proteins. Exosomes also facilitate cell-to-cell interactions and play a signaling role, prompting research into their potential therapeutic effect.

If stem cell exosomes could be administered to patients instead of whole stem cells themselves, the problems of immune rejection and unwanted cell growth could be avoided. Also, some key advantages could be gained. ""Exosomes can be purified, stored, and precisely dosed in ways that stem cells cannot,"" Dr. Mead said.

In a rat glaucoma model, Dr. Mead studied the effects of exosomes isolated from bone marrow stem cells on retinal ganglion cells. Exosomes were injected weekly into the rats' vitreous, the fluid within the center of the eye. Prior to injection, the exosomes were fluorescently labeled, allowing the researchers to track the delivery of the exosome cargo into the retinal ganglion cells.

The results of this work appeared January 26 in the journal Stem Cells Translational Medicine, in an article entitled,  Bone Marrow-Derived Mesenchymal Stem Cells-Derived Exosomes Promote Survival of Retinal Ganglion Cells Through miRNA-Dependent Mechanisms.  The article indicated that treatment of primary retinal cultures with bone marrow derived MSC (BMSC) exosomes demonstrated  significant neuroprotective and neuritogenic effects. 

Exosome-treated rats lost about a third of their retinal ganglion cells following optic nerve injury, compared with a 90% loss among untreated rats. Stem cell exosome-treated retinal ganglion cells also maintained function, according to electroretinography, which measures electrical activity of retinal cells.

 Exosomes,  the article s authors wrote,  successfully delivered their cargo into inner retinal layers and the effects were reliant on miRNA, demonstrated by the diminished therapeutic effects of exosomes derived from BMSC after knockdown of Argonaute-2, a key miRNA effector molecule. 

The researchers determined that the protective effects of exosomes are mediated by miRNA, molecules that interfere with or silence gene expression. Further research is needed to understand more about the specific contents of the exosomes, said Dr. Tomarev.

""We need to know which particular miRNA there are more than 2000 different miRNA molecules are delivered into the retinal ganglion cells and what proteins or signaling pathways are being targeted upon arrival,"" elaborated Dr. Tomarev. ""We also need to attempt to target exosomes to specific sets of neurons and other cell types or groups of cells.""

Finally, the most optimal exosome approach needs to be identified, Dr. Tomarev added. It may be that the best approach would be to combine exosomes with additional therapies. From a treatment feasibility standpoint, a lot will depend on how frequently exosomes need to be administered to achieve a therapeutic effect.","Pharmaceuticals"

The Nobel laureates and academics have signed an online petition decrying the executive order as discriminatory, detrimental to U.S. national interests, and imposing undue burdens.

 The EO [executive order] significantly damages American leadership in higher education and research,  according to the petition, titled Academics Against Immigration Executive Order.  The proposed EO limits collaborations with researchers from these nations by restricting entry of these researchers to the U.S. and can potentially lead to departure of many talented individuals who are current and future researchers and entrepreneurs in the U.S. 

The order poses undue burdens, according to the petition, because it  will necessarily tear families apart by restricting entry for family members who live outside of the U.S. and limiting the ability to travel for those who reside and work in the U.S. 

 This measure is fatally disruptive to the lives of these immigrants, their families, and the communities of which they form an integral part. It is inhumane, ineffective, and un-American,  the petition declared.

Trump and aides have defended the executive order, whose stated purposes include  to protect the American people from terrorist attacks by foreign nationals admitted to the United States,  adding:  The United States cannot, and should not, admit those who do not support the Constitution, or those who would place violent ideologies over American law. 

The order suspends issuing of visas for 90 days to nationals entering the U.S. from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen. During that time, the Department of Homeland Security is to review  information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the [Immigration and Nationality Act] (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat. 

However, the secretaries of State and Homeland Security may make exceptions on a case-by-case basis. And after the executive order was initially enforced through detentions of holders of green cards and dual citizenship, Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly yesterday stated that he deemed the entry of lawful permanent residents in the national interest  absent the receipt of significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare. 

The executive order also indefinitely blocks refugees from entering the U.S. from Syria and suspends admission of refugees for 120 days, during which time the administration has said it plans to develop an improved security screening process, then cap admissions at 50,000 refugees annually.

Nobel laureates in physiology or medicine who signed the petition as of 8 a.m. ET Monday included Richard Axel of Columbia University; Linda B. Buck of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center; Andrew Fire of Stanford University School of Medicine; Roger Guillemin of the Salk Institute; Edvard Moser of Norwegian University of Science and Technology; and May-Britt Moser, Chair of the Kavli Institute for Systems Neuroscience, Norwegian University of Science and Technology.

Also, Randy Schekman of University of California, Berkeley; Jack Szostak; Thomas C. S dhof of Stanford University School of Medicine; former NIH and National Cancer Institute director Harold Varmus of Weill Cornell Medicine; Eric Wieschaus of Princeton University; and Torsten N. Wiesel, president emeritus of The Rockefeller University.

Separately, Allergan CEO Brent Saunders issued a tweet decrying the executive order:  Oppose any policy that puts limitations on our ability to attract the best & diverse talent. 

Two days before the executive order was signed, the research advocacy group Research!America released results of a survey revealing a split among Americans on whether they believe the U.S. will be viewed as the global leader in science and innovation under President Trump: 41% agreed, 40% disagreed, and 19% were not sure. Respondents who agreed included 70% of Republicans, 34% of independents, and only 19% of Democrats.

The executive order capped a first week for the Trump administration that included restrictions on public communications by researchers at several agencies; the removal of pages supportive of human-caused climate change from the White House website and plans by researchers opposed to Trump administration policies to organize a Scientists  March on Washington. No date had been set at deadline, though organizers have established a twitter handle (@ScienceMarchDC) and a Facebook page.

The Innovate UK grant will support assessing the feasibility of harnessing the Arcis technology for extracting and stabilizing RNA directly from urine. Arcis says if successful, the process could be adapted to develop kits for the collection of home urine samples, which could then be sent off for testing at clinical laboratories.

 The ability to validate and use RNA biomarkers for clinical diagnostics is potentially game-changing, and being able to extract and store RNA from urine samples would offer clinicians a simple, minimally invasive diagnostic procedure,  commented Jan Rogers, Ph.D., Arcis Biotechnology CSO.  We are delighted that Innovate UK has identified the potential opportunity provided by our RNA extraction and stabilization technology. 

Arcis is focused on the development of fast nucleic acid sample preparation technology. The firm s ready-to-use Arcis DNA Prep and Arcis DNA Blood kits exploit a two-stage DNA isolation procedure that allows users to prepare DNA for subsequent PCR or quantitative PCR (qPCR) evaluation in just 3 minutes from a range of fresh and stored sample types, including microorganisms. The firm s most recent product, the Arcis DNA Blood Kit (IVD), was launched in October 2016. Arcis raised  2.5 million ($3.1 million) in an oversubscribed fundraising round in February 2016 to support commercialization of its portfolio.

This  inhibition of anorexia,  the scientists decided, helps the pathogen manage a tradeoff between virulence, which is the ability of a microbe to cause disease within one host, and transmission, which is its ability to spread and establish infections between multiple hosts. Thus, as far as the pathogen is concerned, the old saying should be  starve virulence, feed transmission. 

Detailed results from the scientists  work appeared January 26 in the journal Cell, in an article entitled,  Pathogen-Mediated Inhibition of Anorexia Promotes Host Survival and Transmission.  This article described how the Salk team took a fresh look at the connection between Salmonella and loss of appetite.

Previous studies mostly involved injecting a microbe or microbial products directly into the circulation of an animal model and studying its effect. In the current study, however, animals were infected orally thus mimicking the bacteria's route of infection (it spreads from mouse to mouse when the animals eat each other's contaminated feces).

""Traditionally in infectious disease, we think that the stronger a pathogen's ability is to cause disease, the greater its potential is to be transmitted to other hosts,"" said the Cell article s senior author Janelle Ayres, Ph.D., an assistant professor in immunobiology and microbial pathogenesis at the Salk Institute for Biological Studies. ""But we discovered a pathogen that has evolved to become less dangerous to its host. By employing this strategy, it's easier for the pathogen to spread to other hosts.""

""Host response is only half of the infectious disease equation. We wanted to understand how the bacteria's behavior is affected by the host's loss of appetite, as well,"" Dr. Ayres says. ""What a pathogen wants is a steady supply of nutrients, a stable niche so it can replicate, and a reliable mode of transmission."" In this case, taming the behavior of the pathogen by enabling the mice to take in more nutrition helped keep the mouse healthy, produce more feces, and then spread infection to other animals.

Further investigation revealed the mechanism by which Salmonella Typhimurium inhibits loss of appetite. Sickness behaviors are in large part mediated by a cytokine a type of molecule involved in cell-to-cell communication that sends a signal to the hypothalamus, a region of the brain controlling appetite. But this particular Salmonella blocks activation of the cytokine in the intestines, preventing the gut from signaling to the brain.

 Inhibition of inflammasome activation by the S. Typhimurium effector, SlrP [Salmonella leucine rich repeat protein], prevented anorexia caused by IL-1  [interleukin-1 ]-mediated signaling to the hypothalamus via the vagus nerve,  wrote the authors of the Cell article.  Rather than compromising host defenses, pathogen-mediated inhibition of anorexia increased host survival. SlrP-mediated inhibition of anorexia prevented invasion and systemic infection by wild-type S. Typhimurium, reducing virulence while increasing transmission to new hosts. 

Dr. Ayres says she anticipates finding a similar strategy in other microbes, noting that genes similar to the one known to be important in blocking cytokine activation in Salmonella Typhimurium also are found in other pathogens. ""But a more interesting place to look is at the components of the microbiome, especially the human microbiome,"" she noted.

""When an infection in the host affects appetite, the microbiome is also potentially compromised by the loss of nutrition. I expect to find that the microbiome has evolved strategies to block this sickness response,"" Dr. Ayres adds.

This is something her research group plans to study.

The researchers hope that one day their findings may lead to a better understanding of infection transmission and new ways to treat infections by supplementing patients with nutrition rather than treating them with antibiotics. The goal would be to give patients a treatment that would also prevent them from spreading their cold or fever to others.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Transcription Factor Is Lynchpin to Fighting Viral Infections","In a world of emerging and devastating viral infections such as Zika, Ebola, and influenza, the importance of understanding how viruses target our immune system, and the need to develop new therapies, has never been greater. Now, a team of scientists at Trinity College Dublin has discovered that a biological molecule important in cell growth (STAT3, or signal transducer and activator of transcription ) is also critical in protecting us against infection so much so that we would be unable to fight the common flu virus without it.

Now, a team of scientists at Trinity College Dublin has discovered that a biological molecule important in cell growth (STAT3, or signal transducer and activator of transcription) is also critical in protecting us against infection so much so that we would be unable to fight the common flu virus without it.

This new discovery could pave the way for the development of novel therapeutics charged with restoring our natural immunity to a whole spectrum of viruses that have evolved roadblocks to the immune response. The findings from this study were published recently in Cellular and Molecular Life Sciences in an article entitled  A Novel Anti-Viral Role for STAT3 in IFN-  Signalling Responses. 

During any viral infection, host cells produce an immune molecule called interferon, which essentially disrupts the battle plans of attacking viruses preventing them from replicating in our bodies. When cells are stimulated by interferon- , a cascade of molecules within the cells is activated like a series of dominos, typically leading to clearance of the viral infection.

The interferon signaling pathway initiates the production of several hundred immune molecules that act to destroy viruses and amplify our immune response against them. Yet even with this mechanism in place, many viruses are not cleared by the immune response and can often cause serious illness. With this in mind, the Trinity researchers wondered how viruses suppress the immune response. What they discovered was that cells had evolved numerous methods to inhibit these signaling pathways and thus block responses to interferon.

 We thought that since the interferon signaling pathway enhances the immune response against viruses so effectively, viruses might have evolved means to block it such a reality would explain why several viruses are so troublesome to defeat,"" remarked senior study investigator Nigel Stevenson, Ph.D., assistant professor at Trinity College Dublin.

Over the past few years, Dr. Stevenson and his team have discovered that hepatitis C virus (HCV) and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), among others, specifically target the interferon signaling pathway, which helps them avoid being naturally cured by our immune systems.

""For decades, we have known that STAT3 is essential for healthy cell growth, but our new revelation identifies it for the first time as an essential antiviral component in the interferon signaling pathway,  Dr. Stevenson explained.  In fact, we found that without STAT3, cells cannot fight the common flu virus or the pox vaccinia virus.""

Scientists had, until now, believed they fully understood how the interferon signaling pathway worked, but by using a series of viral infections and cutting-edge molecular techniques, the Trinity team discovered a new antiviral role for STAT3.

""Of course, a major goal of our ongoing work is to find solutions to the real-world problems faced by the thousands of people who cannot clear certain viruses after they have been infected,  Dr. Stevenson concluded.  This discovery opens the door to new therapeutic options, which, we hope, will be able to help people restore their natural immunity against a host of problematic viruses.""","Pharmaceuticals"

"Wearable AI Detects Tone Of Conversation To Make It Navigable (And Nicer) For All","The makers of a new device hope to add 'conversational wing-person' and 'social coach' to the roles wearables can play in helping out with daily life.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/02/06/wearable-ai-detects-tone-of-conversation-to-make-it-navigable-and-nicer-for-all/","Mon, 6 Feb 2017 11:29:00 -0500","NA","Wearable AI Detects Tone Of Conversation To Make It Navigable (And Nicer) For AllIn the past few years, wearables have offered to track many things, to predict illness, and even to give us rudimentary advice on staying healthy. The makers of a new device hope to expand the role that wearables can play in helping with day-to-day life, however, by adding 'conversational wing-person' and 'social coach' to their list of skills.

Researchers from MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL) and Institute of Medical Engineering and Science (IMES) have developed programming to help those for whom conversation is difficult to navigate it with ease, and they've put it all in a wearable for real-time assistance. According to the team, the results of their study, ""Predicting Latent Narrative Mood using Audio and Physiologic Data"" [PDF], suggest that using such technology to pin down the tone of conversation as it happens is nearly within our reach--a potential boon for persons who experience anxiety, aspects of autism spectrum disorder, or other conditions that can make chewing the fat an intimidating prospect.

 Imagine if, at the end of a conversation, you could rewind it and see the moments when the people around you felt the most anxious,  said graduate student Tuka Alhanai, who co-authored the related paper with PhD candidate Mohammad Ghassemi, in a release.  Our work is a step in this direction, suggesting that we may not be that far away from a world where people can have an AI social coach right in their pocket. 

Made possible in part by the Samsung Strategy and Innovation Center, the work centered on using both physical feedback and audio data to train AI for the task of analyzing, and recognizing, when conversations take a turn. Study participants were asked to tell ""a happy or sad story of their own choosing"" while the AI system, mounted in an experimental Samsung Simband, measured wearers' physical responses (such as heart rate, blood pressure, and temperature) and recorded audio and text transcripts to capture such elements as vocabulary, energy, and pitch.

Based on 31 such conversations, researchers trained two algorithms to analyze the data for its overall ""happy or sad"" nature and to classify each five-second chunk of conversation as positive, neutral, or negative. Alhanai explained that, with her team's new system for providing data to shape the AI's neural network, organizing that info at different layers of the network proved more effective than traditional methods, which inform algorithms at the network base.

 The system picks up on how, for example, the sentiment in the text transcription was more abstract than the raw accelerometer data,"" Alhanai said.  It s quite remarkable that a machine could approximate how we humans perceive these interactions, without significant input from us as researchers.

The team will present its findings at this week's Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence conference, and hopes to develop its systems for consumer use in the coming years. In order to further hone the mood-tracking AI, researchers will also need to perform group-based conversation experiments, and to address the privacy-related issues that such a device would pose in the field.

At present, though, results seem promising for a future in which persons who struggle with conversation's twists and turns can get digital support as they go.

 As far as we know, this is the first experiment that collects both physical data and speech data in a passive but robust way, even while subjects are having natural, unstructured interactions,  Ghassemi noted.  Our results show that it s possible to classify the emotional tone of conversations in real-time. ","Healthcare"

Amidst the nation s political divisiveness that is reflected in two strikingly different world views, there is one area that stands out as ripe for developing a genuine consensus: the need to spend money to improve American infrastructure.

Mr. Trump, the real estate developer and builder extraordinaire, has been relentless in advocating for new spending that will create jobs and rebuild national assets that have decayed after decades of use and neglect.

The new administration can unleash a new surge in wealth creation with its call for a massive infrastructure investment program, but I suspect that many Americans have a rather limited view of what politicians mean when they refer to infrastructure spending.

It may be obvious, but it is worth asking why we should care about improvements to infrastructure. On the most basic level, we want to boost economic growth, which is stagnant at around 1.5% annually. We also want to create demand for the skills of working men and women who have lost the opportunity for gainful employment due to offshoring and downsizing from technology s effects on the manufacturing sector. And, of course, we really do need to repair or replace crumbling infrastructure; our roads and bridges and tunnels are becoming dangerously decrepit, and this burdens businesses and individuals with costs and inconvenience. As New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman has said,  Landing at Kennedy Airport from Hong Kong was...like going from the Jetsons to the Flintstones. 

With due respect to Mr. Friedman, infrastructure spending ideally should be about more than that. It should offer a return on investment whose value is magnified well beyond the theoretical market price of a renovated bridge, or the cost of avoiding damage to automobiles from unfilled potholes that would otherwise continue to blow shocks and shred tires. If well designed and properly executed, an ambitious infrastructure program ought to enable existing businesses to leverage the improvements to propel advances in growing segments of the American economy.

Biotechnology (including not only biopharmaceuticals, but also bioengineered food products, biofuels and biodefense mechanisms) is primed for an infusion of infrastructure investment. By supplementing existing tools with robotics, advanced computing and ""big data"" analytics, sustaining the development of promising product candidates and protecting vital intellectual property, we will be investing in a critical part of our national infrastructure.","Healthcare"

The odds of developing breakthrough new medicines get tougher all the time. But America's most ingenious minds aren't backing down. Instead, they are flocking to a new area -- marijuana-related technology -- where a patent-filing spree is under way.

Some 266  marijuana-related patents have been approved in the U.S., and another 255 are pending, according to a new analysis by Envision IP, a Raleigh, N.C., patent-research firm. These filings cover everything from proprietary hybrid strains of cannabis, to ""clean and efficient growing systems, software-based analytics and monitoring, and packaging and distribution infrastructure.""

Nearly half that activity has come in the past three years, as the pace of patent-filing activity has more than quadrupled from levels a decade ago. By Envision IP's tally, nearly 20 companies now hold cannabis-related patents. Among the most active are AbbVie, Jenrin Discovery and Cara Therapeutics.

The impetus for this surge in patent activity, of course, is America's changing legal climate. Wide-open, recreational use of marijuana is now approved for legal use in eight states, including California, Oregon and Washington. Restricted use of marijuana, generally for medical reasons with a doctor's prescription, is allowed in about 20 other jurisdictions, according to Governing.com.

That's a far cry from the norms of, say, 1956, when the federal Narcotics Control Act was passed, spelling out a mandatory prison sentence of two to ten years for people convicted of marijuana possession.","Healthcare"
"Report: Jawbone Is Jumping Out Of Consumer Wearables","From speakers to wristbands to  hospitals? The UP24 maker wants to pivot once again, this time into the medical field according to a TechCrunch report.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/parmyolson/2017/02/06/jawbone-ditching-consumer-wearables-up4-fitbit/","Mon, 6 Feb 2017 06:57:00 -0500","NA","Report: Jawbone Is Jumping Out Of Consumer WearablesIt s been a rough couple of years for Jawbone, the ambitious wearables company that started off making speakers and goofy-looking bluetooth earpieces to move into elegant fitness trackers designed by Yves Behar.

Now it may be time for another pivot.

Following months of reports that it had burned through close to $1 billion of investors' money, the departure of its CFO that signified the end of its IPO dreams and widespread criticism of its customer support (just check out the comments here), Jawbone may be winding down its consumer wearables business to focus on medical devices, according to a report in TechCrunch citing sources that have  confirmed  the shift in business.

Jawbone is in the process of raising yet more money, the site adds citing two sources, with talks said to be at an advanced stage.

The company has struggled to make money in the low-margin consumer gadgets business. Its most advanced wristband, the UP4 was released almost two years ago in April 2015, and its price has since dropped to around $50 from $200 on Amazon. Customers have complained of poor support and frequent breakages of Jawbone's different bands. (My own UP24 stopped working about three months after purchase; the replacement broke too.)

In spite of its difficulties, Chief Executive Hosain Rahman doesn t seem to have had much trouble raising funds. Jawbone has raised more than $950 million in the last 16 years of its existence, from a passel of high-flying venture capital firms including Andreessen Horowitz, Sequoia Capital and Khosla Ventures.

Its valuation dropped in the last two years though, from a peak of $3.1 billion in September 2014, to $1.3 billion in January 2016, according to Pitchbook, when it raised $165 million from the Kuwait Investment Authority.

What Jawbone s new business might look like is unclear   will it continue sell physical wearable devices or just the tracking software? TechCrunch reports its main clients will be  clinicians and health providers working with patients. 

Jawbone at least has some experience in selling to the enterprise. In late 2014 the company jumped into employee monitoring with the launch of Up for Groups, where it sold its devices in bulk to employers.

The company has some skin in the medical field too. In 2013 it spent a reported $100 million on Body Media, a maker of sophisticated wearable sensors that ran a trial program with U.S. health insurer Cigna to track the health of Americans at risk of diabetes.

Also helping to pave the way towards medical: Jawbone s quiet acquisition in 2015 of Spectros, a small, Portola Valley, Calif-based diagnostic equipment company that developed molecular sensing and imaging devices that would allow doctors to remotely monitor patients with life-threatening diseases. Following the purchase, Jawbone installed Spectros founder David Benaron MD as its chief medical officer, and even gave him a board seat.

Plenty of other once-high flying technology companies have shifted out of the fickle consumer market to chase the fatter margins promised by the enterprise, including BlackBerry, Nokia and IBM. But all have had varying degrees of success when faced with challenges like upfront contracts with complicated timings.

Jawbone may have little choice but to make the jump. Fewer consumers are buying fitness trackers overall. In December 2016 some 15.6% of American consumers owned a smartwatch or fitness band, according to Kantar Worldpanel ComTech, but that s just a small increases from 14.8% a year earlier.

And while Fitbit has clearly won the war against Jawbone to dominate fitness trackers, it too has struggled. In January 2017 the company revealed it was cutting its global workforce by 6%. Its shares have meanwhile been trading 70% below their IPO price of $20. FORBES contributor and tech investor Peter Cohan argues that this doesn t make the shares a buying opportunity. Fitbit swooped in to buy Pebble last year, but that signified another once-popular wearables brand that had hit a wall.

If Fitbit s current struggle becomes more serious, who knows - it may also find itself pivoting into the medical field. According to a January 2017 study from British market research firm Juniper Research, fitness wearables are gradually moving into healthcare:

 Vendors like Fitbit, Withings and Misfit are leading this change, making integration with medical databases a priority and focusing on encouraging users to lead  healthier  lives, rather than getting  fitter,   the report says. The good news is, more than 1 in 5 Americans will continue to use activity trackers and the ensuing  health wearables  hardware market will be worth $20 billion.

Whether Jawbone, after all its problems, can get a slice of that market is another question.","Healthcare"
"Trump Wants To Return Power To Patients, And Consumer-Ordered Lab Tests May Be Perfect Place To Start","To the extent that the Trump administration seeks an opportunity to radically redefine healthcare, place more power in the hands of patients, and nurture a consumer-focused health ecosystem, they could do a lot worse than learning from the example of Arizona and other states where DAT is the law.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidshaywitz/2017/02/06/trump-wants-to-return-power-to-patients-consumer-ordered-lab-tests-may-be-perfect-place-to-start/","Mon, 6 Feb 2017 06:00:00 -0500","NA","Trump Wants To Return Power To Patients, And Consumer-Ordered Lab Tests May Be Perfect Place To StartIf you want a simple blood test, like a basic metabolic panel, and live in New York, Rhode Island or many other states, it may cost you dearly not only for the cost of the test itself (whatever that eventually turns out to be), but also for the cost of visiting your doctor, who must order the test. This can be pricey I was recently billed over $400 for a 10-minute uncomplicated visit with my physician.

But if you live in state like Arizona, you can simply walk into a lab such as Sonora Quest and have the panel done for $17 a price clearly posted by the lab and displayed on a price list! on their website; view this exotic healthcare exhibit for yourself, here.

It s possible that this radical idea letting curious patients in Arizona order lab tests on their own may be the one positive outcome of the Theranos fiasco, as the right to do this testing expansively in the state exists largely because of the company s successful lobbying; the legislation was signed in April, 2015. (Ironically, of course, the labs performing these tests use traditional techniques, rather than the novel methods Theranos purported to introduce.) The federal certification standards (CLIA) for clinical testing laboratories are the same whether the test is ordered by a provider or a consumer.

According to the president and CEO of Sonora Quest Laboratories Dave Dexter, consumer-directed testing, generally referred to as  direct access testing  (DAT), is proving to be a huge hit; Dexter tells me by email that his company experienced more than 400% growth in this sector last year, growth he says is continuing at more than 15% per month. Dexter originally offered these comments at a recent nonpartisan healthcare workshop in Washington, D.C., sponsored by the eHealth Initiative (eHI).

Dexter describes himself as  the ultimate skeptic,  but tells me (via email) that  virtually all the preconceived concerns about DAT have been proven to be incorrect.  At the eHI workshop, he explained that doctors in the state have not been suddenly overwhelmed by anxious patients, and patients haven t been overwhelmed by the challenge of dealing with their data. As Dexter sees it, consumers ordering lab tests represents a mechanism of patient empowerment and deeper engagement.

Sonora Quest offers many but not all tests directly to consumers, avoiding tests that tend to be  complex  and  difficult  to interpret, like the test for celiac disease, according to the company s medical director Robert Stern.","Healthcare"
"Trump Acknowledges That The 'Replacement' Of Obamacare Will Span Years","Like the GOP last week, Trump finally acknowledges that the ""replacement"" of Obamacare is likely to span years - and at least into 2018.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/danmunro/2017/02/06/trump-acknowledges-that-the-replacement-of-obamacare-will-span-years/","Mon, 6 Feb 2017 00:07:00 -0500","NA","Trump Acknowledges That The 'Replacement' Of Obamacare Will Span YearsDonald Trump's pre-Super Bowl interview with Bill O Reilly last night was relatively brief (less than 10 minutes) and not surprisingly, Obamacare made the short list of topics. The full video is available online (here), and while a lot of ground was covered, Mr. O Reilly had virtually no time to follow up or to dig very deep so he didn t. The sequence of the topics itself was interesting, and Obamacare appeared toward the end:

Touching on eight policy topics in less than 10 minutes definitely qualifies as a blistering pace, but there was some very real (and long-awaited) insight on the strategy to repeal and replace (or repair) Obamacare. Given the mystery surrounding the replacement of health insurance for millions of Americans, this was valuable insight into Trump's current thinking.

Bill O Reilly: Can Americans in 2017 expect a new healthcare plan rolled out by the Trump Administration? This year? President Trump: Yeah in the process, and maybe it'll take 'til sometime into next year, but we are certainly going to be in the process very complicated. Obamacare is a disaster. You have to remember Obamacare doesn't work, so we are putting in a wonderful plan it's statutorily takes a while to get we're going to be putting it in fairly soon I think that, yes uh I would like say by the end of the year uh at least the rudiments, but we should have something within the year and the following year.

That exchange appeared at the 07:15-minute mark of the ten-minute video clip. The fractured response is typical of Trump when he's speaking ad-hoc and away from a teleprompter, but he clearly acknowledges that the replacement process will run into 2018. For millions with current Obamacare policies, this news alone will likely provide significant relief.

More generally, efforts to repeal and replace (or repair) Obamacare have been stalled because the challenges are not only daunting, they are almost impossible to reconcile with our exorbitantly high cost of healthcare. Ever since Trump s election and even years before the GOP has been hoping, praying and grinding through the mechanics of a replacement strategy, but that trajectory is entirely dependent on an unnatural act for the GOP. The unnatural act is extending those expensive federal subsidies that are fully baked into Obamacare. That fact (well known to all health insurance companies) became official GOP reality just last week:

What we re told is if we don t act by March or April, is that in many states there won t be an insurance company there to sell you insurance. It s also an area where Republicans are going to have to do some things we may not normally do, like cost sharing or reinsurance. We may not like those things, but we may have to do those things for the next two to three years to make sure people can buy insurance.  Lamar Alexander, Chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions (HELP) Committee

The ACA created and supported a healthy individual market, but only in combination with sizeable federal subsidies. Ending these subsidies (a popular idea under the banner of repealing Obamacare) makes it easy for the carriers to simply walk away from the individual market. It s already a relatively small and largely unprofitable book of business. Take away the federal subsidies (around cost sharing, risk corridors and reinsurance), and the insurance carriers won t just walk away they ll run. They ll run not because of any business cowardice, but because they have a fiduciary obligation to do just that. Shareholders would sue and boards would terminate executives for allowing a negative-margin business to exist for anything longer than about one full month.

In the course of one week, both the GOP and Trump finally acknowledged that all of this talk of repeal-and-replace (or now repair) will take a significant amount of time. That timeline was formalized by Trump tonight with the same vagueness that the GOP has always had.  We should have something within the year and the following year.  In other words, we don't really know how long this is going to take. At least he bought the GOP some time to wrestle with the actuarial math. As evidenced by this one chart, that battle isn t winnable but as a country we continue to be very committed to fighting it.

"The March For Science In Washington Is PoliticalWhether You Like It Or Not","The notion that Science with a capital S exists above the fray, beholden only to its facts and findings in a realm of truth is itself ascientific.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/emilywillingham/2017/02/05/the-march-for-science-in-washington-is-political-whether-you-like-it-or-not/","Sun, 5 Feb 2017 17:15:00 -0500","NA","The March For Science In Washington Is Political Whether You Like It Or NotScientists and those who love science have spent many hours since the March For Science In Washington was born, hand-wringing about whether or not the march is 'political.' Most of those who are making requests--and in some cases, demands--that it ""not be political"" fall into one of two categories: white scientists, mostly men, and conservative scientists, also mostly men.

The former seem to want science to be what they've always assumed it was, based on their own fantasy-land perception of it: something pure, above it all, existing in rarefied air that biochemistry tells us would preclude the viability of most living, breathing organisms. The latter are generally concerned that their political stances won't be represented in a ""March in Washington"" that consists largely of people who try hard to follow where real facts lead instead of being distracted by ""alternative facts.""

Too bad for them. Despite the careful wording of ""March in Washington"" instead of ""March on Washington,"" this march has all of the hallmarks of being political, must be political regardless of what the most privileged in the community want and is absolutely in response to political events that have occurred in the last few weeks. Despite efforts of the March organizers to distance themselves and the March from making a statement against the current administration, there is a reason we didn't have scientists organizing to march en masse in or on Washington when Obama was president.

And there are five stark reasons the one they're having now is emphatically political.

1. Scientific research in this country is under political threat.

Pick your worry: public health, defense, basic research, climate research, EPA threatened, the FDA's role, conservation, life-saving contributions from immigrants, to an apparent effort to further marginalize the disability community and on and on. From scrubbing data to scrubbing dollars, all disciplines of science may find themselves on life support, and preventing that from happening by definition must be a political act.

2. Scientific understanding in this country is under political threat, beginning with our earliest education.

A number of Trump nominees, and most alarmingly Betsy DeVos, pose a threat to scientific understanding and practice in this country. This concern affects every member of our body politic from cradle to grave. Consider the Affordable Healthcare Act. Politicians make claims about it that are demonstrably false. Of course, our nation's leaders should not lie and should back up their claims with verifiable facts. Yet so many people don't seem to care at all when they lie or dismiss the evidence as ""fake news."" Every time a politician makes a decision or provides an ""alternative fact"" in the face of verifiable evidence, that politician makes science political. Marching in the name of science against that willfully ignorant acceptance of lies is political.

3. The political repercussions of the threats to science will differentially affect people who have different identities that they bring to the table.

The questions we ask, the evidence trails we pursue and the observations we make all filter through the person and the personal. When a scientist shows up to do her work, she doesn't leave her sex, her gender, her ethnicity, her physical features, her disabilities, her past or her perspective at home. All questions that we ask and answer, the tools and methods we use to answer them and the conclusions we emphasize filter through the person doing the asking ... and the answering.

For years, if you had thrown a beaker in a room full of scientists in the US and hit one of them, you were highly likely to hit a white man. Thanks to politics, that's no longer the case in some--but not all--scientific disciplines. Thanks to politics, people who sit at the bench or bedside may be a lot more like the people they're treating or may be asking questions that are vastly different in content or investigative approach from those that occur to a white man. That matters.

What else matters is that the silencing of science--through defunding, deliberate distortions and DeVos--will scarcely touch the most privileged among us but will profoundly and immeasurably affect the least privileged. Whether it's through losses in public health or clinical advances, reduced access to education for many communities, loosening environmental protections or a host of other repercussions, these effects will last generations. That matters.

As they always have, these differential effects will in turn block access of the less privileged to the paths of science. Whether they are people of color, disabled people, someone whose gender has a historically limited proportional representation, socioeconomically challenged or some or all of the above, they will find obstacle after obstacle to access. Keeping members of these groups from bringing the person and the personal to the bench and bedside and to understanding everything from the earth to the stars matters, too.

4. In the current climate, staking a claim to an intellectual framework that relies on facts, critical thinking and evidence-seeking is a political act.

You've probably heard about ""alternative facts."" We have a problem with frameworks of understanding the world in this country, and it largely resides in a trifecta of failures: Many of us don't know how to verify facts, many of us have a slippery grasp of ethics, and many of us struggle mightily with critical thinking. Science in its workaday use provides a generalizable model for addressing all three.","Healthcare"
"Why I Quit The Yoga Studio For Adriene Mishler's YouTube Channel","There was no expectation that you stretch or push your body beyond your limitations. In fact, the opposite   the entire 31 days was all about bringing a gentle attitude and acceptance to how your body and mind felt in that moment.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/jeenacho/2017/02/05/why-i-quit-the-yoga-studio-for-adriene-mishlers-youtube-channel/","Sun, 5 Feb 2017 16:31:00 -0500","NA","Why I Quit The Yoga Studio For Adriene Mishler's YouTube ChannelI first began my yoga training at The Himalayan Institute in Buffalo, NY in 2002. Unlike many yoga classes which focuses heavily on forcing the body into the postures, at The Himalayan Institute, there was a deeper recognition that the mind and body are interconnected and viewed yoga as part of a deeper spiritual practice. Rather than spending 60 seconds at the end of the yoga class in Shavasana (Corpse Pose), we would often spend significant part of the class in meditation.

It's rather unfortunate that mindfulness and meditation has been divorced from the physical movements of yoga practice. The ancient Yogi's didn't practice yoga for the sake of exercise, but rather as a way to ready the body for sitting meditation practice.

For the past several years, my New Year's resolution has been to do 30 consecutive days of yoga. I've developed a fondness for Bikram Yoga, so naturally, my goal was to do 30 days of Bikram. However, this year, this posed several challenges. First, I was going to be on the road every single week in January, which made going to the studio everyday not practical. Second, the time commitment of 90 minutes of class, plus getting to/from studio, time to shower, change, etc meant that it would take well over 2 hours to do this practice everyday. Again, not practical.

Finally, I wanted to incorporate yoga as part of my daily meditation and mindfulness practice. Often, the Bikram class felt antithetical to my desire for feeling more connected to how my body felt. After a Bikram yoga teacher shouted,  push your body until it hurts. That's how you'll know you're doing it right,  I decided this practice was no longer supportive to my overall well-being, and in fact, harmful.

My New Year's resolution shifted from I must do 90 minutes of Bikram yoga everyday to I am committed to adding physical movement to my day. Rather than feel guilty about not making it to the yoga studio, I would roll out my yoga mat at home to do 10 minutes of sun salutation.

Initially, I was a bit skeptical about doing yoga at home. However, once I stumbled upon a very popular YouTube channel with Adriene Mishler called Yoga With Adriene, I was sold. She has over 2 million YouTube subscribers.

I just completed her 31 day challenge and I recommend it highly. It was the perfect solution for practicing yoga while on the road. Many hotels offered yoga mats that I could borrow and it was wonderful to be able to do a short yoga session in my hotel room. When there was no yoga mat, I simply grabbed a bath towel and did my practice anyway.

It's true that I've noticed more strength and flexibility in the body but perhaps more valuable is that I am much more attuned and aware. When I'm sitting at my desk working for long periods, I started to notice my body gently reminding me to move or adopt a better posture.","Healthcare"
"How Politicians Can Stand Up To Trump - The Politician's Pledge","Is there a way to get all politicians respectfully working together to solve our country s problems and help the most people possible? It can be done and this will diffuse the need of an authoritarian type leader to make it happen.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolynmcclanahan/2017/02/05/how-to-make-politicians-work-for-us-the-effective-politicians-pledge/","Sun, 5 Feb 2017 13:15:00 -0500","NA","How Politicians Can Stand Up To Trump - The Politician's PledgePresident Trump's autocratic style and undermining of democracy through use of inflammatory ""alternative truths"" and attacks on the press can be mitigated - if politicians would stand up to make it happen. Is there a way to get politicians to challenge the President and respectfully work together to solve our country s problems and help the most people possible? It can be done and this will diffuse the need of an authoritarian type leader to make it happen.

President Trump is doing what no one thought he would actually do   follow through on the promises made to his voting base during the campaign. As a financial planner, I am aghast he is attempting to throw out the fiduciary rules that would protect mom and pop investors. As a physician, I am blown away by his plans to repeal Obamacare with no well thought out replacement in sight.

Many people who voted for Mr. Trump didn t particularly care about his policies   they just wanted someone to shake up the system. They got what they asked for and now many realize the havoc this will cause. In my little corner of Trumpland in Jacksonville, Florida, I recently ate dinner in a restaurant with a great happy hour. Four beer guzzling men were sitting at the bar behind me talking candidly and not entirely happily about the President for whom they voted. One lamented,  You have to say one thing about the guy   he is doing what he said he was going to do. Right or wrong, it is refreshing .

There are many reasons President Trump was elected. Middle America is suffering from lack of jobs, stagnant wages, and high health care costs. Government bureaucracy is bloated, time consuming, and many government programs are ineffective. Politicians on both sides regularly lie, create  messages  they think the public wants to hear instead of acting on principles, and spend taxpayer s money investigating each other and making power grabs instead of solving our problems. Everyone is sick of it.

Although use of executive power is no different than in the past, people complain about abuse of this privilege. The legislative branch has done an abysmal job solving problems and helping constituents, so if Presidents want to get anything done, they have little recourse other than to use executive actions. The lack of an effective legislative branch has given rise to the authoritarian tendencies that President Trump now enjoys.

If the respective parties want to earn the respect and trust of their constituents and want to truly serve America, they need to reboot how they lead our nation. How can they do this? We need to have politicians sign  The Effective Politician s Pledge    basically, a set of engagement standards spelling out how they will work with each other and the public.

The Effective Politician s Pledge can contain directives on how they will identify problems, communicate honestly and openly to understand problems from multiple points of view, and work respectfully together to develop and implement solutions.

This is not unheard of - Grover Norquist coerces politicians to sign his  Taxpayer Protection Pledge  although this document is steeped in ideology and not open to nuanced solutions in our monetary system. The Effective Politician s Pledge will be much different   it is geared to make politicians work respectfully together to solve problems and keep our country as one of the best places to live in the world.

What will be in the  Effective Politician s Pledge ? I ve attached a sample to get the country started. Please send your feedback. Wouldn t it be great if we could get everyone to live by these principles? The press, corporations, each other? We can change our culture   we just have to agree to do it.

Let me share an example of how this could be used to solve problems. Take for instance the health care debate. The press and the politicians are focusing on providing insurance to everyone or cutting the cost of care even if it means people don t get the health care they need.

Does everyone really want insurance? No. If you ask people on the street, they want good, cost effective health care and when it comes down to it, they would like everyone to have some basic health care. They do not care how it is funded as long as it is a value to them and doesn t raise their taxes.

Think what would happen if politicians focused on fixing the health care system by addressing the underlying problems with the delivery of health care instead of how we pay for health care. There are relatively easy fixes.

Improvement in care will reduce costs and the funding mechanism would then be much easier to negotiate. A nice side effect? Most people will be much more satisfied with the health care system and subsequently the politicians who were the change agents in making it happen.

We   each and every one of us, including politicians - focus too much on how to protect ourselves and not so much on how to lift each other up and make the world a better place. We should all follow these engagement standards and do our part. Let s change the culture of our country to keep America the wonderful place we know it can be.

"Opposition Mounts To Trump's Medicaid Block Grant Idea","There's mounting opposition to the Trump White House's proposal to Medicaid block grants from hospitals, doctors, insurers and AARP, the large organization of seniors.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucejapsen/2017/02/05/opposition-mounts-to-trumps-medicaid-block-grant-idea/","Sun, 5 Feb 2017 09:30:00 -0500","NYSE:UNH","Opposition Mounts To Trump's Medicaid Block Grant IdeaThere is escalating opposition building across the country to an effort by the Trump White House and the Republican-led Congress to give each state a fixed block grant of federal money to pay for Medicaid coverage for poor Americans.

Such an idea would be a huge change in how Medicaid is financed. Opponents say it could lead to reduced benefits if states don t have the ability to pick up costs for new treatments or an influx of eligible patients during bad economic times that trigger job loss. Hospitals, insurers, doctors and just last week   the nation s giant lobby for seniors   AARP, came out against Medicaid block grants .

 A block grant would end the guaranteed access to care for millions of Americans who are eligible and instead provide a fixed amount of federal funding to each state for its Medicaid program, which may not take into account increases in actual cost or need,  AARP senior vice president of government affairs Joyce Rogers wrote members of the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee in a letter last week.

Of the 70 million Americans covered by Medicaid, more than 17 million are  low-income seniors and children and adults with disabilities who rely on the program for critical health care and long-term services,  Rogers said. The Affordable Care Act also expanded Medicaid with 31 states plus the District of Columbia opting to do so.

Though the idea to block grant Medicaid was a paragraph in the healthcare proposal from Donald Trump s presidential campaign, it has gained momentum from the White House lately. Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway two weeks ago said Medicaid block grants would be part of the repeal and replacement of the Affordable Care Act as a way to give states more flexibility. ""Those who are closest to the people in need will be administering it,"" she told NBC.

Historically, Medicaid has been more open-ended and funded via a match of funds between the states and federal government. Thus, if a particular state Medicaid program was faced with a large number of people in need of expensive medicines or treatments, more federal dollars would flow to the state. States also see an uptick in Medicaid patients when companies lay off workers.

 We oppose the end of the guarantee and are concerned that fixed federal funding to states will result in cuts to program eligibility, services, or both   ultimately harming some of our nation s most vulnerable citizens,  AARP s Rogers wrote.  Moving from the current Medicaid financing structure to fixed federal Medicaid block grant funding would shift costs to states and state taxpayers. ","Healthcare"
"The Study That Said Female Doctors Are Better Than Male Doctors","If you still think that being a woman somehow prevents someone from being a good doctor, you are what's called an idiot.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2017/02/04/the-study-that-said-female-doctors-are-better-than-male-doctors/","Sat, 4 Feb 2017 16:23:00 -0500","NA","The Study That Said Female Doctors Are Better Than Male DoctorsIf you still think that being a woman somehow prevents someone from being a good doctor, you are what's called an idiot. If you do not know what idiot means in this case, you are an idiot. Forget the notion that our medical system and society have become post-gender or post-racial in any way. Not even close. Our medical system and society haven't even become post-stupid and still need studies like the one published in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine to compare men and women as doctors. Yes, in the year 2017, many people still need a study and perhaps even further studies to show them that women, who are humans, can be as effective as other humans as doctors.

In fact, in the JAMA Internal Medicine study, women came out slightly ahead. A team of researchers (Yusuke Tsugawa, MD, MPH, PhD, Anupam B. Jena, MD, PhD, Jose F. Figueroa, MD, MPH, E. John Orav, PhD, Daniel M. Blumenthal, MD, MBA, Ashish K. Jha, MD, MPH) from Harvard analyzed over 1 .5 million hospitalizations of Medicare patients 65 years or older over a four year period (January 1, 2011, to December 31, 2014). They found that patients treated by female physicians had a 0.43% lower chance of dying (11.07% vs 11.49%) within the first 30-days after being admitted to the hospital than patients treated by male physicians. They also found that patients treated by female physicians were less likely (15.02% vs 15.57%) to be re-admitted to the hospital within 30-days after being discharged from the hospital. The researchers indicated that these findings persisted even when adjusting for type of medical condition and severity of illness. In other words, you can't explain these results by saying that men just take care of sicker patients.

Why did the study find female doctors to have somewhat lower mortality and readmission rates? Well, analyzing a single broad population sample only suggests some possible general trends and does not definitively confirm or explain the trends. Many other factors besides inherent gender differences could explain the results. For example, maybe hospitals that are more likely to recruit and retain female doctors have other characteristics that lead to better care such as more resources, better-trained staff, more enlightened leadership, and less hostile environments. Are females who make it through medical education on average more qualified and capable because they've been held to higher standards? Maybe. Could many female doctors be working harder because they feel like they need to prove themselves? Possibly. Could the challenges that women face during their careers make them in general more empathetic towards patients? Potentially. Is the male average being dragged down by older male doctors who are not up to date on the latest guidelines or procedures? Perhaps. Large population studies tend to lump individuals into broad categories, make gross generalizations, and gloss over more complex differences among individuals. Regardless, the results certainly do not support any notion that women in general are worse doctors than men.

Why is such a study even necessary? Well...the unfortunate reason is that enough people still hold on to or propagate the belief that gender somehow is related to performance as a doctor. (By the way, such people are not all men. There are women who hold such beliefs too.) Women continue to face particular challenges during their medical careers such as being questioned whether they are really doctors and being asked ""do you like vagina"" as reported by Allyson Herbst in the Washington Post.  (Note: being asked if you like vagina is not a question on the medical boards.) In the hospital halls, you still hear some doctors and patients saying, ""women doctors do this"" or ""female doctors do that."" Gross generalizations. Some grosser than others. And these are just the people making their opinions known, so who knows how many others feel the same way. In fact, persistent stereotypes have led Heather Logghe, MD to start #ILookLikeASurgeon:

Why should female doctors be any less capable than male doctors? Yes, men may be naturally better at some jobs such as being sperm donors. And women are better at being egg donors. (Men are terrible egg donors, unless you are talking about Easter eggs.) However, for the majority of other jobs such as being a doctor, being a man or a women doesn't necessarily make you more or less capable. What matters is the individual.

The Harvard study does not tell you to always choose a female physician instead of a male physician. Remember both men and women include a very diverse range of people with different personalities, viewpoints, skills, abilities, and backgrounds. Some men and women are spectacular doctors. Others probably should have been dog surfing instructors. (Not that there is anything wrong with being a dog surfing instructor, but you don't want a dog surfing instructor treating your infection.) The rest sit somewhere along the spectrum. Women can be just as meticulous or just as sloppy as men. Or just as cold or warm. Or just as hard-working or lazy. In fact, a given man and a given women can be more similar to each other than two given women. Or two given men. (Or for that matter, two taken men or two taken women.)

Will we ever reach a time when people use other more relevant characteristics to judge a doctor rather than gender, racial/ethnic background, appearance, beliefs, lifestyle, or anything else unrelated to job performance? Being truly post-gender and post-racial means everyone looks beyond appearances and focuses on capabilities. Unfortunately, society and the medical system are still nowhere near this point.

Allen Campbell is his personal chef. As Hilary Sargent for Boston.com describes, Campbell became ""obsessed"" with plant-based diets and then met Brady and his wife Gisele Bundchen. So what does Brady eat, besides opposing defenses? Here's what Campbell told Sargent:

Yes, life is nice when you make a boatload of money and can have someone shop and cook for you.

So which of these should you (or even can you) follow? Well, a lot of Brady's diet is consistent with standard nutrition recommendations such as reducing meat consumption, increasing vegetable consumption, favoring whole grains, avoiding processed foods and additives and moderating sugar, salt, fat and caffeine intake. What's different or not necessarily supported by science? Most nutritionists don't suggest avoiding fruits besides bananas, but that may just be a preference for Brady. Here are other aspects of his diet that are questionable:

Eating like Brady wouldn't be cheap. Should you bother? Following what's consistent with standard nutrition recommendations makes sense. But the other things? Not really. Many people hawking diets will make claims about different foods and cooking styles. They will cite particular people's experiences as support. However, the challenge is that diets are complicated, so you don't quite know what exactly is helping, what is doing nothing and what is actually doing harm. Also, a lot of dietary changes have psychological effects. If you believe something is making you feel better, you may actually feel better. That's why when it comes to diet recommendations, stick to what has been tested with scientifically rigorous studies and not to people saying, ""Oh, I stopped eating this and felt better.""

Also, keep in mind that Brady is not you. He has personal trainers, mentors and coaches, the best equipment and apparel, lots of comforts, a nice house and neighborhood surroundings, people around him telling him how great he is, a good job with decent benefits and, yes, a supermodel wife. His diet and chef are not the sole reasons for his success or feeling good. Even if you avoid nightshades, dairy, fungus and gluten, you probably won't play football like Tom Brady or get a supermodel wife, but you may end up spending money on food like he does.

"Super Bowl 2017: Return-To-Play Decision, As Simple As A Drop Of Blood?","Clearing athletes for return to play after suffering a concussion is an inexact science. The use of blood-based biomarkers, along with current approaches, may potentially provide additional data in such decision making.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/robertglatter/2017/02/04/super-bowl-2017-return-to-play-decision-as-simple-as-a-drop-of-blood/","Sat, 4 Feb 2017 13:57:00 -0500","NA","Super Bowl 2017: Return-To-Play Decision, As Simple As A Drop Of Blood?The decision to return a player to competition after suffering a concussion is based on a careful evaluation of an athlete s symptoms, successfully passing established protocols to measure progress after a graded exercise program is underway, as well as understanding that each player is unique when it comes to recovery.

Neurologists, trainers and team physicians use a systematic approach to decide when it is appropriate for an athlete to return to play.

With the Super Bowl just about to kick off, all eyes will be focused on the field. But during the regular season and playoffs, there have been some questionable return-to-play decisions making the public feel less confident that players are being treated appropriately after suffering a concussion.

After a concussion, what is often referred to as  brain slosh  or jarring of the brain in the skull, releases compounds which cross from fluid surrounding the brain into the blood stream. This passage of proteins in the fluid represents an ideal opportunity to sample the degree of injury .

A blood sample of one compound-- tau protein--represents an opportunity to assess whether a player is truly making a recovery , as tau protein appears in the serum in elevated concentrations after head trauma, and may thus serve as a marker to determine whether a player is demonstrating clinical improvement.

Contrasted with the potential utility of tau protein to evaluate players who might not have classic symptoms such as dizziness, nausea or balance abnormalities, is the harsh reality is that existing methods to determine whether a player can safely resume play are quite subjective, and may even be manipulated by athletes who complete preseason baseline tests knowing that they may  game  the system by purposely underperforming to give the false impression of improvement.

Athletes who manipulate return to play protocols may place themselves at risk for not only a longer recovery, but also a second impact system that can be fatal. Add to this the increased risk for chronic neurodegenerative diseases such as ALS, Parkinsons, or chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE), and the benefits of measuring such a biomarker as tau protein become quite evident.","Healthcare"
"Healthcare Investing and the Advantage of Industry Expertise","Healthcare investing favors industry expertise more so than any other sector.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/peterhans/2017/02/04/healthcare-investing-and-the-advantage-of-industry-expertise/","Sat, 4 Feb 2017 13:41:00 -0500","NA","Healthcare Investing and the Advantage of Industry ExpertiseInvesting in healthcare poses a unique challenge. Healthcare is enormously complex, only rewarding fund managers with deep technical understanding of scientific and regulatory developments within the industry. A love of minutia and obsessive attention to detail is a requirement.In my opinion, Healthcare more so than other sectors, rewards industry-specific domain expertise. In my experience, the best investment managers and analysts in the Healthcare space are M.D.s, while conversely there is little correlation between being a successful retail analyst and working at Nordstrom. This can be further magnified for emerging managers given the opportunities for outsized returns in small and microcap healthcare plays.

One fund that I recently came across represents a great example of this phenomenon - Thessalus Capital LLC. The founders are brothers and Medical Students, who, according to sources, posted an impressive 44% return in 2016. In comparison, the S&P500 returned 8.53%, S&P500 healthcare index lost -4.02%.

Stock prices for pharmaceutical companies can double overnight, or crater, on news of Phase III clinical trials, M&A activity, or even personnel changes on FDA regulatory boards. This is especially true for companies which are often too small for larger asset management firms.

Outside of a position in PFE, which was more market timing than anything, I ve had very little success in healthcare investing. This can be attributed to my lack of expertise in the core science required to analyze the companies and their products. The founders of Thessalus did not face this same issue and launched a strategy based on their domain expertise.

According to founder Kenneth Ng,  We saw the tremendous growth potential in healthcare. In collaboration with Princeton s financial engineering department, we launched a quantitative fund with a core mission of being research-heavy and establishing strong primary contacts into industry and financing sides of biotech. 

 Our premise was to evaluate hundreds of healthcare ventures on fundamental clinical value, and systematically find the biggest wins waiting to happen. 

In 2016 the premise worked. The start-up fund, managed by MD and PhD students at top medical schools across the country, invested in some of the largest healthcare successes last year, including Medivation (+120%), Vanda (+79%), and Exelixis (+55%), listing compound returns since the fund s point-of-entry. The fund also shorted biotech disappointments including the much-hyped Sarepta. Thessalus s call to go all into Medivation proved particularly prescient, when the company was acquired by Pfizer for $14B in August.","Healthcare"
"Study Suggests That Immigrant Doctors Provide Better Care Than U.S. Medical Graduates","Coincidentally, this study came out the same week as new immigration policies and protests emerged...","http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2017/02/04/study-suggests-that-immigrant-doctors-provide-better-care-than-u-s-doctors/","Sat, 4 Feb 2017 12:25:00 -0500","NA","Study Suggests That Immigrant Doctors Provide Better Care Than U.S. Medical GraduatesDuring the opening monologue to a Saturday Night Live episode, comedian Louis CK once indicated that he has ""mild racism"" because of the following thoughts: ""say I m in a hospital and the doctor comes in to treat me and the doctor s from China or India, I ll think, Well, good, good, good. More of that."" Indeed, here is more of that. A study recently published in journal BMJ (British Medical Journal) seems to support CK's ""mild racism"" by showing that Medicare patients treated by doctors from foreign medical schools had a 5% lower chance of dying than those treated by U.S. medical graduates. Coincidentally, this study came out in the week after President Donald Trump signed an executive order blocking entry of people from seven predominantly Muslim countries, which has ended up affecting many immigrant doctors and has caused many to protest and say ""bad, bad, bad. Less of that.""

Five researchers from Harvard Medical School (Yusuke Tsugawa, Anupam B. Jena, Ruth L. Newhouse, E. John Orav, and Ashish K. Jha) conducted the study, which involved analyzing data on Medicare patients who received care from more than 44,000 internists for over 1.2 million hospitalizations in the U.S. They found that patients treated by international medical graduates had a 11.2% mortality compared to 11.6% for those treated by U.S. medical school graduates in the 30 days following hospitalization. They also found that international medical graduates tended to spend a little more than U.S. medical school graduates on their patients but this difference was not statistically significant. Note that these findings were for doctors born in other countries, not American-born doctors who went to medical schools in other countries.

Of course, such study results are very broad generalizations and lump together people who have a wide variety of backgrounds, cultures, and personalities. Different medical schools offer differing qualities of education and attract different types of students. Stereotypes of any type, even when positive, overlook the individual and can lead to inaccurate and even harmful conclusions. Just because you were born in the U.S. and attended a U.S. medical school doesn't mean you are a worse doctor. Just because you are an immigrant and went to a foreign medical school doesn't mean that you are better.

However, this study and other findings may help shed more light on ongoing issues in the medical system. For example, Dr. Tsugawa also led a similar study published in JAMA Internal Medicine that showed that Medicare patients treated by female doctors also were less likely to die than those cared for by male doctors. Such findings may be in part due to the fact that medical school and the medical profession are not level playing fields. Getting into medical school and medical training programs, finding jobs, and advancing in the profession can be tougher for immigrants or anyone who looks ""different"" such as women and minorities. (A doctor in my fellowship program once said, ""you are different and people don't like different."") This may mean that on average people who are ""different"" have to be more qualified and work harder to get to where they are.

Immigrants are often among the best and brightest in the U.S. They have had to go through a lot to get to the U.S., and the process and obstacles already weeded out the ""weaker"" and less capable ones. Yes, they've already gone through ""extreme vetting"" in other ways. Looks like the executive order is already affecting medical care in the U.S. For instance, the order seemed to have prevented Dr. Suha Abushamma, an internal medicine resident at the Cleveland Clinic, from returning to work. The Chairs of medicine at the major hospitals at Harvard, Johns Hopkins, University of Michigan, and University of Pennsylvania wrote a commentary published in the New England Journal of Medicine that re-affirmed the importance of legal immigrants (yes, legal) to American medicine and stated:

Such a commentary doesn't come from bleeding hearts. It comes from realism. Anyone in medicine knows how important legal immigrants have been to the medical field. (This is the same reason that the tech industry is so concerned about immigration restrictions.) As Julia Belluz and Sarah Frostenson for Vox showed, nearly one-fifth of all health care workers and 27.9% of all doctors in the U.S. are immigrants. The doctor numbers jump up to 50.7% for geriatric medicine, 47.2% for kidney specialists, 43.6% for cardiologists, and 41% for critical care specialists. Many immigrants take the toughest jobs in medicine, work in the most undesirable places, and take care of the most difficult to treat patients. Many immigrants work in clinics and hospitals that serve rural America...and parts of the country that may have high rates of anti-immigration sentiment. Talk about kicking yourself in the butt. Yes, there is a good chance that an immigrant will be saving your butt one of these days. (Butt is a technical term.)

Banning legal immigrants is a...let's see, what's the scientific term...""stupid"" policy. Anti-legal immigrant policies basically say that you don't want some of the smartest and most talented people to come to this country. Again, as a reminder we are talking about legal immigrants. (Legal, legal, legal.) Medically, it's like cutting off your limbs or head because you somehow think that the body part may be a threat to the rest of your body.  It's similar to saying that my hand may slap my face one day so better cut it off as a precaution. It ignores all the positive things that your hand can do. And, in case you didn't know, it's not good medicine.

"Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Says Burn Your Bra","This same website that told you to put stones in your vagina now says if you want to get over an ex-lover burn your bra.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2017/02/04/gwyneth-paltrows-goop-says-burn-your-bra/","Sat, 4 Feb 2017 07:30:00 -0500","NA","Gwyneth Paltrow's Goop Says Burn Your BraWhat's that smell before Valentine's Day? Maybe burning bras. Gwyneth Paltrow's website GOOP is at it again, giving physical, emotional, or mental health advice. This time the same website that told you to put stones in your vagina has the following suggestion: if you want to get over an ex-lover burn your bra.

Yes, now Suzannah Galland says on the GOOP website that ""lingerie you wore with past lovers can carry the toxic residue of those relationships, along with painful memories."" Who is Galland? Well, her website describes her as an internationally acclaimed life advisor and relationship expert but doesn't say anything about her past experience with bras. Galland goes on to say on the GOOP web site that:

She then lists the steps in the bra burning ritual:

This is terrific news for Victoria's Secret or anyone else who sells bras and lingerie. You are basically burning to a crisp perfectly wearable underwear so that you need to buy more. If this becomes a national trend just watch Victoria's Secret's sales peak. (By the way, the GOOP website does sell lots of bras...hmmm.) Fruit of the Loom and Hanes must be disappointed that no one is telling men to torch their boxers, boxer briefs, tighty whities, or...gasp...thongs after getting dumped.

Is Gallant's recommendation something with no scientific proof such as putting a stone up your vagina to improve your skin? Is the idea of ""toxin residues"" living in your bra far-fetched, assuming that you do bathe regularly? Not exactly.

Science has shown that participating in rituals or ceremonies can have significant positive psychological and healing benefits. As a Scientific American piece by Francesca Gino and Michael I. Norton indicated, research has demonstrated the effectiveness of rituals in reducing anxiety, alleviating disappointment, and increasing confidence after a loss. Gino and Norton recounted an experiment that they performed in which they conducted a lottery and then had the ""losers"" divide into two groups. (The losers of the lottery and not people who are losers in general.) One group went through a ritual that had each draw a picture of how he or she felt, sprinkle a pinch of salt on the drawing, tear up the drawing, and then count up to ten in his or her head five times. The people who performed the ritual reported feeling less grief. Imagine what may have happened if they had also burned their underwear.

Gino and Norton added that rituals that intend to produce a certain result are more likely to produce that result. This goes beyond the ritual of sitting on the toilet to make you more likely to leave something in the toilet. Even without a cause-and-effect link between the ritual and the desired effect, performing the ritual can still help the effect occur, perhaps through inspiring or focusing you. For example, wearing your favorite underwear may help you perform better in a game, debate or concert even though your underwear shouldn't really matter (unless you are playing a very weird sport). Similarly, burning your bra won't really do anything about your ex-, unless your ex- happens to be wearing the bra at the time, which would not be advisable. (Burning a bra while your ex- is wearing it is not advisable, that is, and not your ex- wearing your bra, which actually may help you get over your ex.)

Thus, Galland's suggestion is probably not specific to your bra. Performing a ritual of any kind that's meant to help you move on from a past relationship could indeed help you venture forward. You don't necessarily have to set fire to your wardrobe.

"World's Scientists Offer Their Laboratories To Colleagues Stranded By Trump's Immigration Order","President Trump's executive order is already hurting scientific progress in the United States. But the global scientific community is responding in solidarity with colleagues stranded overseas as the administration implements the mechanics of the order.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/davidkroll/2017/02/03/worlds-scientists-offer-their-laboratories-to-colleagues-stranded-by-trumps-immigration-order/","Fri, 3 Feb 2017 11:05:00 -0500","NA","World's Scientists Offer Their Laboratories To Colleagues Stranded By Trump's Immigration OrderWhile all of the major scientific and medical research societies have issued statements decrying President Trump's executive order prohibiting travelers to the U.S. from seven Muslim-majority countries, the European Molecular Biology Organization (EMBO) has gone a step further.

Late Wednesday, the 29-member state research entity launched its Science Solidarity webpage, a resource where U.S.-based scientists stranded abroad could connect with laboratories in their discipline and locality to continue their work temporarily. The list acts as a clearinghouse where scientists can directly contact potential hosts, independent of EMBO administration.

Last night, I spoke about the genesis of this effort with Dr. Maria Leptin, who just celebrated seven years as EMBO director and cell biology investigator at the European Molecular Biology Laboratories in Heidelberg, Germany.

""As you may imagine, we're all extremely worried about the ban anyway. I first heard that the Champlimaud Institute in Portugal had opened its doors to people who were stranded,"" said Dr. Leptin. ""Then colleagues started tweeting and sending emails about what they were doing, offering their labs as sanctuary or shelter. It turns out, now that we started this, it seems that a large number of people had all been thinking along the same lines.""

Dr. Leptin and her EMBO staff got to work. ""It seemed to me that one of the problems would be how does anybody find out that colleague X in lab Y was offering their bench, and how do they know who's looking for a bench. With our network here at EMBO and with top leading and highly-connected scientists throughout Europe and the world, in fact, this would be a good way of bringing the communities together.""

On the Science Solidarity page, laboratory leaders can post facilities and resources available to researchers overseas who are unable to return to the U.S. due to the immigration executive order. Laboratory staff, fellows and students are also signing up, offering temporary accommodations to displaced scientists.

Scientists from some of the seven Muslim-majority countries who hold staff positions at European institutions are particularly keen to help out their peers. Dr. Elmira Mohandesan, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Vienna, has offered ""a warm Iranian welcome and accommodations!"" Vienna is one of several European institutions that also generally supports refugee scholars and students.

When we spoke last night, the number of laboratories listed at the EMBO page passed the 500 mark. At the time of this posting (18 hours later), that number had grown to 725. Scientists from EMBO member states and cooperative nations, including China and India, have been offering stranded scientists lab bench and desk space, access to specialized scientific instrumentation and assistance with short-term housing, in some cases with financial support.

I asked as to what kind of results the page has generated. Dr. Leptin said, ""It's only been one day, of course, but we don't monitor that at all. We can't act as brokers or negotiators or matchmakers. All I can say is that a couple of stranded scientists have written to me directly and I've said that I can't do anything for them unless they want to come to my lab. We'll probably look back next week to see about the results but right now we're just trying to keep everything administratively under control.""

She noted that other organizations are trying to collect lists of scientists in need and their hope is that the EMBO list of laboratories offering facilities can help these.

At the Atlantic, Ed Yong has featured stories of some of the scientists who are affected by Trump's travel ban and how it is already hurting U.S. science.

Dr. Leptin notes that travel restrictions of varying breadth have often stunted the progress of international science. She even shared her own recent experience.

""I was directly affected by this last February when the U.S. suddenly decided that anyone who'd been to Iran couldn't be granted a visa,"" said Dr. Leptin. ""I've always been able to travel to the U.S. under the visa waiver program and ESTA (Germany is one of 37 countries to U.S. that allows tourism or business visits of less than 90 days without a visa.) But I had spent the summer in Iran and was suddenly not allowed to come in. I was scheduled for an important meeting at the NIH and had to get a visa double-quick.""

Of course, not all scientists have the resources of the director of a major research organization.

""I know many of my colleagues just think, 'Screw it, I'm not going.' But that's not good for our colleagues in America, it's not good for us and it's not good for science,"" said Dr. Leptin.

In most cases, these political and travel issues sporadically affect individuals. Dr. Leptin explains the difference between then and now.

""As individuals, we think we don't have much power and we're not going to do anything. But this order was such a crass act and had such far-reaching effects that we had to vent our outrage somehow,"" said Dr. Leptin. So EMBO chose to channel this outrage into a global scientific resource.

If you are outside of the United States and wish to offer your laboratory resources to fellow scientists affected by the White House Executive Order 13769 ""Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist Entry into the United States,"" please visit the EMBO Science Solidarity List to register your offer.

"On National Women Physicians Day, A Reminder That Women Save More Lives For Less Pay","Women have been practicing (licensed) medicine and working against pay disparity since 1849, but today's hearty wage gap is starting to widen again.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/janetwburns/2017/02/03/on-national-women-physicians-day-a-reminder-that-women-save-more-lives-for-less-pay/","Fri, 3 Feb 2017 10:33:00 -0500","NA","On National Women Physicians Day, A Reminder That Women Save More Lives For Less PayIn 1849, Elizabeth Blackwell became the United States' first licensed woman physician after having been famously allowed to attend medical school as a joke. Now, almost 17 decades later, women are serious business in the field of medicine (if not their wages), and it's time to throw off our surgical gowns and celebrate.

Observed February 3, National Women Physicians Day honors the birthday of Elizabeth Blackwell, the U.S.' primary woman physician, but also the work of the millions of doctors who've since followed in her at times arduous footsteps. Launched last year, the now nationally recognized holiday also draws attention to women's triumphant success rates in the medical field, and to their chronically stunted recognition and compensation therein.

Dr. Hala Sabry, an osteopathic emergency physician and founder of the Physician Moms Group (PMG), petitioned for the holiday to mark the accomplishments of Dr. Blackwell, as well as those hard-won advances and countless innovations that women in medicine have seen since.

""When I think of Dr. Blackwell, who was accepted into medical school as a practical joke, I am grateful for how far we've come,"" said Dr. Sabry in a release. ""The fact that women are entering the medical field in increasing numbers is a tribute to pioneers like her. It's important to remember their stories and maintain the progress so every little girl who dreams of becoming a doctor won't hesitate because of her gender.""

According to Dr. Sabry, the holiday also offers an opportunity to shine a light on areas of medical practice that haven't managed to keep up with the times when it comes to women doctors--even as their success rates have taken the lead.

After comparing notes with the approximately 65,000 members of PMG, Dr. Sabry discovered that many women doctors were experiencing the same kinds of discrimination, both in exams rooms and in the payroll department. She explained by phone, ""It's really frustrating, as female physicians, to be speaking with patients at length about their condition and then have them ask, just based on gender, 'When s the doctor coming in?'""

 Our group was talking about feeling undervalued, and brainstorming ways to let the public know we exist,"" she said. ""With the help of the American Osteopathic Association, we ve been pushing to promote the holiday in hopes of furthering and improving communication with patients toward a better quality of care. 

See also: Birth-Control Repeal May Cost Women $1.4B A Year In Copays (For Starters)

According to research, that dedication to a higher quality of doctor-patient communication pays off--if not in dollars, then in lives.

In December, a study published by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) found that female doctors were simply superior at treating patients in the studied age group than their male counterparts were, even after every practitioner or patient factor was considered, and that if male doctors could somehow take a leaf out of their female peers' medical book, upwards of 32,000 deaths could be avoided each year among Medicaid recipients alone.

To explain this vital discrepancy, researchers pointed to women physicians' greater tendency to provide preventive care and counseling, and to  have a more patient- centered communication style, [be] more encouraging and reassuring, and have longer visits than male physicians. 

And while it's nearly impossible to put a price on human lives, the medical establishment hasn't yet been able to realign its coffers to appropriately compensate doctors who save them. Last July, a massive study by researchers at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital uncovered an ""atrocious"" wage gap for doctors and other medical practitioners that grows more staggering with every rung up the ladder, and which guarantees women's salaries are nearly $20,000 less on average than those of their equally skilled, equally experienced male counterparts, or about 8% (as TIME points out, doctoring while black also has serious financial downsides). And it seems to be getting worse.

Despite discouraging data on how female physicians and patients are treated, however, Dr. Sabry believes there's no time like the present for honoring women's medical past in our country, as well as their future.

""Especially with all the negativity in the air and in the media right now with regard to women and equality, it's important to reflect and spread the word on what we've accomplished, and how far we've come,"" she said.

""Medicine is not immune from inequality,"" she added. ""But we're ready to celebrate.""","Healthcare"
"Medical Tech Or Personal Touch? PeraHealth Has Cracked The Code","By combining the power a clinical assessment with computer analytics, PeraHealth is reducing in hospital mortality by more than 30%.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/johnnosta/2017/02/03/medical-tech-or-personal-touch-perahealth-has-cracked-the-code/","Fri, 3 Feb 2017 10:09:00 -0500","NA","Medical Tech Or Personal Touch? PeraHealth Has Cracked The CodeIt just might be one of the biggest discussions in digital health the role of technology as a replacement for that innate human connection.

Let's face it: technology isn't always a friend of medicine. Ask almost any clinician and you're almost certain to get a mixed review of how technology has changed medicine--for better and worse.  The quintessential 'human touch' of care is commonly substituted for complex analytics and processes that leave us with a very cold stethoscope that chills both patient and clinician.  So, what really is it, tech or touch?  It seems to be that the argument has been made for both sides but an interesting option comes to us in the form of PeraHealth.

In many ways, PeraHealth is emerging as a prototypical digital health company that, at least for me, gets checks in many of the right boxes. Let's take a closer look.

Many of today's digital health innovators and startups are driven by personal experience.  PeraHealth s founding purpose stems from the personal story of Michael and Steven Rothman. Their mother was hospitalized for valve replacement surgery, and while her doctors and nurses were competent and attentive, the system failed to detect her slow, post-op deterioration. Now this is key--her slow deterioration fell between the crack of human and technological assessment.  Mrs. Rothman died in the hospital.

Out of this personal tragedy, Michael and Steven were inspired to capture the wealth of data in the EHR and synthesize it into meaningful information to actively help clinicians. Together, the Rothman brothers analyzed the available clinical data and developed the Rothman Index (RI) model, which synthesizes EHR data into actionable information for care providers in the form of a health score measuring a patient s overall condition and plotting it over time.

Rothman Healthcare was founded in 2005 to further validate the RI model and develop a software solution, now known as PeraTrend, for healthcare providers to utilize its predictive capabilities. The software that was developed enabled care providers to detect subtle signs of deterioration earlier and intervene sooner, improving patient safety and outcomes.  Today, PeraHealth offers a range of clinical surveillance solutions, working with more than 80 leading hospitals and care providers utilizing the Rothman Index.

The Rothman Index is the only general measure of patient condition available to healthcare providers. It leverages hospitals  EHR investments and utilizes existing, real-time data and predictive analytics to quantify and visualize patient acuity and risk. The RI model uses a range of physiological measures as inputs, including labs, vitals, and nursing assessments to produce a disease-agnostic, universal patient score from 0-100 that is presented in color-coded graphs trended over time. The result is a continuous measure of patient condition, integrated into the EHR, computed on a real-time basis across all conditions, diseases and care settings. This allows clinicians to quickly visualize a full picture of patient condition, understand which patients are at-risk of a serious health event, and take immediate action.

Ok, go re-read that paragraph.  You'll begin to digest some important information.  And two key points might jump out at you. The first is essential and the core at differentiating PeraHealth.  It's the inclusion of the nursing assessment--the human touch!  The second is a simple scoring process that feels a bit similar to a FICO score.  A trending score that is visceral and easy that doesn't require complicated analysis.","Healthcare"

She has been expanding conventional theoretical physics frameworks and their mathematical machinery to describe non-equilibrium, open systems such as life and living systems that are strongly coupled with their environment. It's her  hypothesis that the near-zero gravity environment could result in accelerated mutation rates of MRSA. In other words, we can press the ""fast forward"" button and get a sneak peak at mutation patterns that have not yet occurred on earth.

Our work in micorgravity on International Space Station is both very practical and fundamental. We are pushing the envelope of personalized, precision medicine, enabling better prediction of drug resistance and hence smarter drugs. On a fundamental science level, I am keen to test my 20 year old hypothesis that the environment can deeply influence the information flow from both the genome and transcriptome.

The implications for medicine and drug developement are tremendous. Current antimicrobial therapies are often ineffective, and the emergence of resistance can only be observed in real time or retrospectively. So treating infections is often a ""catch-up"" scenario where pathogens can be elusive and have the upper hand. Goel and her team plan to leverage the unique environment in space to observe the activity of MRSA from gene expression to mutations to provide insights into what might happen back on earth. These data can be used to leapfrog drug developement and find molecules that may be effective against strains that are predicted by this extraterrestrial microbiology lab.

In the cramped quarters of space and the value-conscious environment of both earth and space, technology and innovation are driving solutions that may offer real-world solutions for the astronaut and hospitalized patient alike. One thing's for sure: The future is simply out of this world.

Think again. Futuristic tech is improving health already -- and it's about to explode in popularity.

Sure, everyone has a Fitbit. But soon, counting your steps won't be all wearables can do. Sano, for instance, is prototyping a patch that can continuously track your blood glucose using small electrical signals. It will launching in beta sometime this summer.

Doctor visits are increasingly going digital. HealthTap, one of many telehealth companies, lets you not only have an appointment via video chat but also share test results, get a prescription or referral and look at medicine reviews -- and it's covered by insurance.

New tech doesn't have to mean computers or startups. Plenty of cities are starting to build green infrastructure or looking at health metrics when they plan new transportation. Soon the partnership between data science and urban planning will make whole cities healthier -- and greener.

The biohacking movement plus lack of strict FDA regulation of supplements equals non-prescription pills for your brain, with Nootrobox in the lead. Its current offerings claim to increase alertness or optimize sleep, with genetically personalized pills on the horizon.

Speaking of genetics, DNA testing is becoming the new normal. Companies like Color Genomics let customers screen for potentially dangerous DNA mutations in their own homes -- and are working on getting clearance to test for much more.

Not all health tech is splashy, but that doesn't make it less impactful. RapidSOS is making waves with a simple idea: Its app, Haven, lets users contact 911 with the push of a single button and relays their location via GPS. Next up? Using that data to predict accidents before they occur.

Quantified health soon won't be just about your weight and steps. The Mayo Clinic and Delos recently debuted the Well Living Lab, a living space that can measure everything from a subject's sleep quality to how her desk chair is impacting her blood pressure. The findings could result in precision homes.","Healthcare"
"Healthcare Supply Chain Redesign: Waging A War On Chronic Disease","Healthcare costs are spiraling, and political debates faltering. Healthcare redesign is on the national agenda. The question is what to do? What if we could redesign the healthcare supply chain to reduce costs and wage a war on chronic healthcare issues? In this post, we outline options.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/loracecere/2017/02/02/healthcare-supply-chain-redesign-waging-a-war-on-chronic-disease/","Thu, 2 Feb 2017 10:37:00 -0500","NA","Healthcare Supply Chain Redesign: Waging A War On Chronic DiseaseDuring the week of inauguration I was in Washington. A steady breeze blew on a warm winter day. Flags were flying. It was beautifully prepped and there was a lump in my throat. Even though I did not attend the ceremony in person, I felt the excitement of the inauguration. I whistled and walked with a spring in my step. I am proud to live in a country where power transitions are peaceful. As a political junkie, I anxiously watch the events unfold in the Trump administration. One of the top debates is healthcare. <In this blog post I will abstain from political commentary. This was a heated and divisive election. > Here I offer a supply chain view.

As a small business owner this issue is close to my heart. I provide healthcare for my employees. The team is small and virtual. Unfortunately there are few healthcare options for a small business like mine. When I moved from Maryland to Pennsylvania, the healthcare coverage for my company was canceled. Coverage is governed by state policies. While technology enables virtual teams, healthcare options for a virtual workforce are limited. Policies are designed for large companies and teams that are co-located within a state's boundaries. It took three months to find a new plan.  The journey was frustrating; and in the end, the options few. My policy is not cheap. Each employee costs me $12,000/year to insure.

Healthcare reform is a hot potato. It is passed from House to Senate to State Legislatures; but to no avail. As costs skyrocket, little changes; yet we have the same debates. As a supply chain person, I see it as a broken value chain which needs fixing. Rhetoric creates divides, not answers. Today's design of the healthcare system is on efficient sickness. This includes hospital check-in, triage, administer services, check-out, and payment administration. If I had a magic wand I would shift the focus to health and wellness with a clear focus on the patient, with a shift in focus from the hospital to the home. Let me explain my logic. Chronic disease (a condition lasting for more than three months) drives 85% of today's healthcare expense. Over the next decade it will get worse not better. Leading the list of chronic diseases are cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Eighty-eight percent of Americans over 65 years of age have at least one chronic health condition; and 25% of adults in the United States have two chronic diseases. The root issue is lifestyle. Health damaging behaviors - smoking, sedentary lifestyle, and poor eating habits - are major contributors. I would like better healthcare coverage for my employees at a lower cost. Healthcare costs stunt business growth. I feel that I am not alone. I think that this cannot happen unless we wage a war on chronic disease. In this blog post I outline some steps which could be taken through supply chain redesign to change the system.

Today's debate rages on emotional issues. I would like to see a shift from win/lose arguments to focus on redesign.

Wage a War on Chronic Disease. Enlist the Help of Large Manufacturers.

Pharmaceutical manufacturers operate with margins of 22% while medical device manufacturers post operating margins of 18%. These margins, over the course of the last decade, increased. They are the second and third most profitable industries in the value chain. Beverages is number one. To reduce chronic disease, we need to enlist the help of these manufacturers and engage in education and social change programs to reduce the health factors that drive chronic disease. The list is endless. This could be early detection for cancer. Programs for diabetics in their homes. Food and nutrition education in schools or working with community leaders to redesign health delivery for the urban poor.

I am fascinated by the fact that no healthcare manufacturer has used channel power to start to wage this war to improve the value chain for healthcare delivery. Or wage the war on chronic disease voluntarily. This is a missed opportunity.

Eliminate Pharmaceutical and Medical Device Advertising. Growing up, television advertisements by drug manufacturers were non-existent. It was illegal. In 1985 the ruling was changed. It grew from $360 million in 1995 to $1.3 billion in 1998. It is now over $5.2 billion. My favorite show is CBS Sunday Morning. The program started in 1979, and I have watched it for over three decades. It was much more enjoyable before drug advertising became legal. As I watch the commercials roll, I imagine what could happen if we shifted this spending to wage a war on chronic disease.

Stop Bifurcated Trade. Bifurcated trade, by definition, is payment, upon a sale, to multiple parties. The greater the bifurcated trade in a value chain--commerce between multiple parties--the greater the waste. (Tracking payments and accounting for revenue along with the potential issues of theft.) An easy example of bifurcated trade, that will be familiar to all, is coupon exchange in retail. When a consumer uses a coupon, the shopper gets a discount, and the store is paid for the use of the coupon by the manufacturer. Of all supply chains, bifurcated trade is the greatest in pharmaceutical and medical device sales. It is a complicated web of rebates and price discounts. One of the first steps that Congress could take is the elimination of bifurcated trade. This would make reporting easier and eliminate cost.

Redefine Business Networks through Hyperledger. Over the course of the past three decades, I have lived at ten addresses with precautionary screening for breast and colon cancer at five different facilities. Interoperability and physician collaboration is tough today. I have to manually request the transfer of records and physically carry them to the hospital to have the files merged. Patient confidentiality and HIPAA compliance add complexity; but today, it is very difficult to transfer records. When I went to the hospital last week I could not locate the baseline mammogram taken when I was 39. Nor could I get the original records of colon screening when I was 42. Hyperledger, often termed blockchain, evolved to ensure security of bitcoin in the dark web. It is a promising technology to transfer unstructured data--images, notes, files--securely between parties. Could we improve chronic care by building a network of networks to share patient records more securely with less cost using these new technologies? I think it is worth a test.

Provide Channel Data (Daily Data Daily) to Manufacturers. Inventory turns in pharmaceutical and healthcare value chains is 1/5th the level of other process-based industries. Walmart reduced the costs of retail through the introduction of Retail Link. This is a private network to share daily sales data to make better decisions. This helps suppliers to align to sales and drive response agility. Today the latency of demand data translation from a hospital to a manufacture is two to three months. Manufacturers are out of step with demand. With the sharing of downstream data from hospitals, service providers and drug retail, pharmaceutical companies could reduce inventories by 30-40% with the potential to reduce the cost of treatment.  Today no healthcare manufacturer--pharmaceutical or medical device--company can see true channel demand for their products. They are insulated through a complicated web of distributor relationships. Healthcare redesign for daily data sharing could force the manufacturers to own the channel with direct shipments and disintermediation of distributors which adds to cost, insulates the manufacturer from true demand signals, and adds unnecessary stockpiles of inventory.

When we analyze the data in the table for the healthcare value chain, the first line represents the averages, while the second line with the  green and red arrows represent percentage change comparing 2006 to 2015. A green arrow represents a positive change while a red one indicates slippage. Note that manufacturers have twice the operating margins of hospitals. They are more concentrated, and are the natural power brokers to drive change. However, most of the change is coming from the more fragmented provider base like Sisters of Mercy, and Kaiser. Also note that overall, the value chain is improving; however, it is in single digits, not the dramatic change we need to fight escalating costs. To affect lasting change we must redesign the value network.","Healthcare"

"Suppliers Are Being Asked To Cut Emissions - And Saving Billions As They Do So","As pressure grows on business to reduce its environmental impacts, they are looking beyond their own operations to the opportunities available in their supply chains. Suppliers that embrace the opportunities this creates are not just cutting emissions, but reducing their costs, too.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/mikescott/2017/02/02/suppliers-asked-to-cut-emissions-and-saving-billions-as-they-do/","Thu, 2 Feb 2017 09:00:00 -0500","NASDAQ:MSFT","Suppliers Are Being Asked To Cut Emissions - And Saving Billions As They Do SoWhen companies look to reduce their environmental impacts, they very quickly realise that there is a limit to what they can achieve by focusing solely on their own operations.

For many businesses, their main impacts on issues such as resource scarcity, water and energy use come either through how their products are used once they have been sold or in their supply chains.

It used to be thought that there was nothing a customer could do about its suppliers  business practices and impact on the environment, but there is a growing realisation that purchasing organisations have the power to change the way their suppliers behave .

Nowhere is this more evident than in the latest report on supply chains by CDP, the global environmental data platform. The Missing link: Harnessing the power of purchasing for a sustainable future report reveals that suppliers cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  by 434m tonnes in 2016, more than the annual emissions of France, saving themselves $12.4bn in the process, double the amount of savings revealed the year before.

The reductions were disclosed at the request of 89 of the world s largest purchasing organizations, including General Motors, BMW, Johnson & Johnson, Microsoft and Walmart. Between them, these 89 big buyers wield a combined purchasing power of US$2.7 trillion.

 Almost half of the top 100 projects by savings were related to energy efficiency, and with a payback period of three years or less, the majority of projects had an attractive investment profile too,  CDP said, but despite the huge savings made, suppliers are still failing to seize the opportunities on offer . Almost half of those questioned failed to reply to the survey.

Suppliers will face growing pressure to act following the ratification of the Paris Agreement on climate change, not least because supply chains are responsible for, on average, four times a company s direct emissions. But it is not just regulation that will push companies to act   businesses in years to come will face resource constraints, water scarcity and disruption from extreme weather events as the impacts of climate change become ever clearer. On top of that, consumers are increasingly unwilling to support brands that are not seen to be taking steps to become as sustainable as they can. As a result, companies looking to avoid the risks and capitalize on the opportunities presented by the low-carbon transition will be scrutinising their suppliers and demanding changes to the way they operate.

One example of this is they way that growing numbers of companies are committing to procure all of their electricity from renewable sources either independently or through initiatives such as RE100.","Healthcare"
"Why Healthcare Rationing Is A Growing Reality For Americans","Rationing of healthcare services according to an individual s ability to pay   or, as the case may be, the inability to do so   is becoming more prevalent in the United States, both in the public and private insurance spheres.

Commercial payers, for example, are increasingly requiring doctors to follow a complex and time-consuming authorization process. Recent surveys show that 75% of doctors complain about this often unnecessary step.

Insurance companies know that given all the time the process consumes, some physicians will choose the path of least resistance and just skip ordering a test or referral they might otherwise have pursued. In response, a coalition of 16 organizations including the American Hospital Association, the American Medical Association and the American Academy of Family Physicians banded together last week to try to force insurance companies to eliminate this practice, except in rare situations.

The word ""rationing  denotes a process for allocating essential resources in situations of scarcity. Rationing happens during an absolute limitation in supply, or when high production costs or excessive demand for consumption limits supply. In the poorest countries of the world, healthcare rationing exists explicitly and people have no choice but to accept it.

In some of these poorer countries, individuals face limited access to needed services unless they have the resources to pay high fees at ""private clinics"" owned by individual doctors. And the inevitable delays in accessing necessary care for urgent and emergent problems lead to higher mortality and complication rates.

In a visit to India in the fall of 2016, I had the opportunity to meet with physicians, hospital leaders and representatives from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation about perinatal mortality, both for mothers and their unborn children. When I learned that mortality was 10 times more than that of the United States, I was not surprised by the statistics but caught unaware of the reason these mothers and their unborn children were dying. It had nothing to do with poor prenatal services, inferior medical education or lack of skilled midwives. Rather, it was simply a matter of distance and time too much distance and too little time.

The reason so many women in India die unnecessarily in childbirth is that more than 90% of births take place at home, and without ready access to emergency-type treatment. As a result, when complications arise that threaten the life of the mother and/or baby that could be addressed through a Cesarean (C-section), the woman simply can't reach a facility to have the procedure in time.","Healthcare"

and appear to be the furthest along in moving quickly from the traditional fee-for-service approach that can lead to overtreatment and unnecessary medical tests and procedures. And rival , which operates Blue Cross and Blue Shield plans in 14 states, isn t far behind.

Value-based pay is tied to health outcomes, performance and quality of care of medical-care providers who contract with insurers via alternative payment vehicles like accountable care organizations (ACOs), a delivery system that rewards doctors and hospitals for working together to improve quality and rein in costs.

In these models, doctors and hospitals take on more risk that they can streamline the care, improve quality and eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies.

 We made solid progress in 2016 with over 45% of Aetna's medical spend currently running through some form of value-based care model , positioning us to achieve our 2020 goal of 75%,  Aetna CEO Mark Bertolini told analysts on the company s fourth-quarter earnings call earlier this week.  We formed multiple collaborations with healthcare providers that span a wide spectrum of value-based care models including two new joint venture relationships. 

UnitedHealth Group spends $52 billion of its $115 billion  in total annual medical spend  through value-based care contracts with doctors and hospitals.  It represents roughly 45% of total spend,  a UnitedHealth Group spokesman said.

Anthem said it currently has  more than 43%  of payments tied to shared savings programs. Through such programs, doctors and hospitals contract to improve quality, lower costs and then keep any money saved from year to year based on the arrangement with the health plan.

 Our goal by 2018 is to hit 50% in shared savings programs,  Anthem spokeswoman Jill Becher said.  When you combine this with our pay for performance programs we will have well over half our spend in collaborative arrangements over the next few years. 

It remains unclear how the Republican-led Congress and Trump administration will view value-based care for Medicare and Medicaid insurance for poor Americans.

The Obama administration was working on increasing to 50% the amount of all Medicare dollars paid to doctors and hospitals via  alternative  reimbursement models by the end of 2018. Donald Trump s pick to be U.S. Health and Human Services Secretary, Dr. Tom Price, has spoken favorably about value-based care but hasn t committed in his Senate hearing to the Obama administration s goals for Medicare.","Healthcare"

"How Fast Food Wrapping And Packaging Can Be Bad For Your Health","Why? After all, you don't eat wrapping and packaging materials, right? Well, actually maybe you do.","http://www.forbes.com/sites/brucelee/2017/02/01/how-fast-food-wrapping-and-packaging-can-be-bad-for-your-health/","Wed, 1 Feb 2017 23:52:00 -0500","NA","How Fast Food Wrapping And Packaging Can Be Bad For Your HealthHere's another thing to worry about at a fast food restaurant: the packaging. That wrapping paper and paper containers that hold your burgers, fries, burritos, etc. can be bad for your health. But as long as you don't stuff the materials up your nose, you should be safe, right? After all, you don't eat food wrapping and packaging materials. Well, actually maybe you do.

Many fast food wrappers and containers have a grease repelling chemical coating, which according to a report in the journal Environmental Science & Technology Letters, may consist of fluorinated compounds. As the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) explains, these fluorinated compounds, otherwise known as PFASs (Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) may ""affect the developing fetus and child, including possible changes in growth, learning, and behavior, decrease fertility and interfere with the body s natural hormones, increase cholesterol, affect the immune system, and increase cancer risk."" The wonderful thing is that you may not have to eat the wrappers or packaging materials to eat PFASs. Prior studies (such as this one, this one, and this one) have shown that these chemicals can move from the packaging onto your food. Yes, you may be thinking WTPFAS?

For the report, researchers from the Silent Spring Institute (Laurel A. Schaider), California Department of Toxic Substances Control (Simona A. Balan), Green Science Policy Institute (Arlene Blum), Environmental Working Group (David Q. Andrews), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (Mark J. Strynar), Hope College (Margaret E. Dickinson and David M. Lunderberg), Oak Ridge Institute for Science and Education (Johnsie R. Lang), and Notre Dame (Graham F. Peaslee) used particle-induced  -ray emission (PIGE) spectroscopy to measure the amount of fluorine in around 400 samples of wrappers and containers from fast food restaurants around the United States. They found that 56% of the dessert and bread wrappers, 38% of the sandwich and burger wrappers, and 20% of the paperboard, and 0% of the paper cups had fluorine.

Fast food wrappers and packaging are not the only sources of PFASs. Many water repellent, stain-resistant, and non-stick household products have PFASs. The CDC lists the following examples:

Dental floss? As if you needed another reason not to floss. And unfortunately pollution has resulted in PFASs in the soil, water, and other parts of the environment. Even though PFASs may be all around you, you may want to take steps to reduce your exposure, since the bad health effects may depend on the amount and duration of exposure.

So what do you do to avoid PFASs in your food? Well, one option is to ask for no packaging and just have them throw the hot fries in your mouth or in your hands. However, in many cases, having hot food thrown at your face won't be safe. Another option is to ask for the food in a paper cup, a paper bag that doesn't have the coating, or a ceramic plate or bowl if available. A third option is to avoid restaurants and other locations that use such wrappers or packaging. Also, you may want to stop licking that melted cheese off the wrapping paper.

How much exposure to these wrappers and packaging is too much? Unclear. The amount that leeches into your food really depends on the temperature of the food, the type of food, the length of time it remains in the packaging, and the amount that was on the packaging. You probably don't want to wrap your face in them every day (for general aesthetic and social reasons as well), and the greater the exposure, the greater the risk. You may want to encourage your favorite eateries to change their packaging. Just remember, food at certain restaurants and eateries may have a bad wrap.

The Amazon prototype store's top level would install robots to pick out goods to bring to shoppers, while the lower floor would offer produce and other items that consumers tend to prefer to choose themselves, sources told the Post. The store could also include a pharmacy and other features. The store concept would support a maximum of 10 employees at any given time   for example, a manager whose responsibilities would include signing up customers for Amazon Fresh grocery delivery and other services, as well as staffers assigned to restocking shelves and facilitating drive-thru order pickups.  We have no plans to build such a store,  an Amazon spokesperson told the Post.

If true   which Amazon insists that it s not   such a move (or something close to it) would continue Amazon s penchant for automating tasks that are more efficiently and profitably completed by robots. Robotic fulfillment has become increasingly entrenched in Amazon s e-commerce operations since the e-commerce giant bought warehouse technology company Kiva Systems Inc. in 2012, and the retailer is also testing a convenience store, Amazon Go, that eliminates friction by automatically checking out shoppers  purchases via mobile application as they exit the store.

 The consumer does not need human assistance at checkout. You don t need cash or credit cards, just your phone and an Amazon account,  Nels Stromborg, executive vice president of Retale, a location-based shopping platform aggregating weekly circulars from over 110 top retailers for mobile and digital devices, told Retail Dive earlier this year.  You take the things you want, walk out of the turnstiles and go. The experience is more efficient. 

As with its experiments with drone delivery and its deployment of robots in fulfillment, a move to leverage robots in stores not only helps Amazon drive down friction for its customers but also slashes a major expense in physical store operations, says Profitero VP of strategy and insights Keith Anderson.  It s evident to me they re thinking hard about how to solve some of those cost drivers,  Anderson told Retail Dive.

However, the increased use of robots is coming under scrutiny by economists, who are debating its long-term effect on employment.

Barber used this innovation to created Black Cow pure milk vodka. The beverage is processed with a special strain of yeast to convert lactose into ""beer milk"" that is then distilled into vodka.  The product, which doesn't taste like milk but has ""a smooth flavor and creamy finish,"" is selling for $40 per 750 ml in the UK. Barber produced 120,000 bottles of Black Cow vodka in 2016 and plans to double production this year.

Liquor sellers specializing in high-end products rarely give up such products' shelf space to their more  ordinary  competitors   in part because consumers of premium booze tend to be brand-loyal.

Premium consumers are also drawn to experimentation. If retailers bring in something really different, such as a vodka that originates from cow's milk, they're likely to give a try. By offering and promoting unusual products, retailers are likely to earn good returns   return visits, that is.

This is also a good reminder for beverage manufacturers. To lure consumers who want premium experiences, producers may need to turn product formulations on their heads. And while it's likely that vodka distilled from potatoes will still reign supreme, Black Cow vodka has certainly churned up the beverage space, and may continue to grow in popularity, despite the product's potential ""ick"" factor.","F&B"

The ice cream maker said 82% of its consumers already enjoy novelty food items and consumers have already been slicing their Ben & Jerry's pints to make ice cream sandwiches. The product concept was born from the company's practice of slicing open pints to ensure chunks and swirls of ingredients are evenly distributed, delivering the ""best part of the pint.""

Sometimes a potential new product is staring you in the mouth, waiting to be discovered.

This is an example of manufacturer engagement with consumers at its best. Brands should be tracking more than just which products consumers buy. They should study changing purchasing patterns around certain holidays, times of year, and events or circumstances for which shoppers buy products.

How consumers eat the food products should also be top of mind for brands. Knowing this kind of behavior inside and out could lead to opportunities to innovate beloved products, as Ben & Jerry's has done. Coca-Cola did this by creating Cherry Sprite after noticing it was a popular combination at its Freestyle soda fountain machines.

Social media is an easy way for brands to take the pulse of their consumer base. Encouraging followers to share their product experiences on Facebook and Twitter can provide a valuable window into the consumer experience, and reveal how products are actually used, regardless of how they are positioned.","F&B"

In fact, nearly 94% of consumers noted they would be loyal to a brand that offers complete transparency, according to a recent study from Label Insight.

Although there s still about 17 months until the labeling law takes effect, retailers and manufacturers that don't comply may look as though they are trying to hide something, which could trigger consumer distrust. Players at each stage of the grocery food chain must be connected and aware of the ingredients and processes used to produce final products. Otherwise, retailers could see a sales hit for certain items.

Retailers must also stay up to date on the products they carry and ensure that no non-compliant items are sold after the deadline. Otherwise, they could face fines and shopper scrutiny.

Contemporary consumers strive to be well educated on the products they buy and the retailer they buy from. It's possible that if the retailer-shopper trust is breached by selling items that don't comply with the new law, some shoppers could switch their loyalties to a retailer they perceive as more honest.","F&B"

"Dollar disruptors: How discount stores are shaking up the grocery world"," No longer a haven for poor quality goods, the low-cost sellers are building several stores a day and putting serious margin pressure on traditional retailers. ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/grocery--dollar-stores-grocery-disruption/435274/","Mon, 06 Feb 2017 04:03:32 -0500","NA","Dollar disruptors: How discount stores are shaking up the grocery worldNot so long ago, dollar stores were the oddballs of the retail world, home to an assortment of discontinued groceries, party supplies, inexpensive toys and other low-priority goods. They were so non-threatening to traditional retailers that some, like Wal-Mart, co-located with them.

What a difference a few years and an economic downturn makes. Beginning with the recession in 2008, value-focused consumers began turning their attention to the dollar stores in their communities. Companies like Dollar General and Family Dollar capitalized by tightening up their operations and increasing their assortment of groceries, household goods and other consumables.

Not only did dollar stores manage to seize the moment   they retained many of these customers for the long run and continued to make gains. According to research firm GlobalData Retail, sales at dollar stores grew from $30 billion to $45 billion  between 2010 and 2015, a 50% growth clip that far outpaced the 17% growth seen by retail overall.

But can dollar stores dollar stores keep this growth going?

 Twenty-five years ago, you saw dollar stores inside strip malls and supermarkets because they generated some decent traffic,  Richard George, professor emeritus of food marketing at St. Joseph University s Haub School of Business, told Food Dive.  In the last 10 years, their amount of consumables has increased to the point that they re a major competitor. 

With three-quarters of their stock dedicated to everyday necessities like toilet paper, cereal and cleaning supplies, dollar stores have long catered to regular fill-in trips. During the past few years, analysts say, dollar stores have strengthened their mix of consumables through improved merchandising and by stocking more in-demand branded products.

Dollar stores also caught on to what other retail formats long ago realized: Food drives traffic. Customers visiting a dollar store today can grab frozen meals, prepared sandwiches and salads, and even fruits and vegetables. On its website, 99 Cents Only advertises daily deliveries of  farm fresh produce. 

Ken Morris, principal at consulting firm Boston Retail Partners, said customers aren't the only ones taking dollar stores more seriously. Manufacturers are, too.

 CPG manufacturers are paying more attention to dollar stores, and are offering dollar-sized packaging and more brand-name merchandise beyond the traditional secondary brands and discontinued products they sold in the past,  he told Food Dive.

At the same time, dollar stores have retained what numerous sources called their  treasure hunt  appeal by offering a limited assortment of home d cor, clothing, and various knickknacks.

Dollar stores have a product mix that appeals to the core demographic of low- and middle-income consumers. What s surprising many in the industry   including dollar stores themselves   is that it appeals to millennials and high-income shoppers, too. According to checkout data gathered by the NPD Group, 25% of customers at the three biggest dollar chains are millennials from households earning $100,000 or more.

This makes perfect sense to Morris, who says millennials adjust their spending by category.

 Many affluent millennials are choosing to save money on consumable products and splurging on experiences and big-ticket items,  he said.

The data doesn t surprise George, either. He s studied millennial shopping habits for several years, and said they re very receptive to buying through alternative channels.

 If you talk to millennials, you learn that many of them haven t stepped foot in a traditional supermarket for a very long time,  George told Food Dive.

Dollar stores  growth across income levels has taken a toll on traditional retailers by pressuring their prices and by chipping away at margins. Some supermarkets, in response, have cribbed directly from the dollar store playbook, offering more dollar items and deals like ten items for $10. Many stores like Target now have a special section stocked with $1 products.

No retailer knows the pressures of dollar stores better than Wal-Mart, which serves many of the budget-conscious shoppers that Dollar General, Family Dollar and company have targeted.

 What dollar stores did is reverse the formula on Wal-Mart,  Neil Stern, senior partner with retail consulting firm McMillanDoolittle told Food Dive.  Wal-Mart made a lot of money by putting up a supercenter in one community and then drawing from three or four communities. Dollar stores came in and said,  We re going to put five of our stores in between the customer and their journey to Wal-Mart.   

The world s largest retailer fought back with its own dollar-store offshoot called Wal-Mart Express. But the format failed to catch on, and shuttered last year. The company sold its 102 stores to Dollar General.

If dollar operators can fend off Wal-Mart, sources say, they can survive pretty much anything. Indeed, dollar stores are immune to many of the headwinds that can slow down other retailers. They thrive in a weaker economy; they re small, which means they have low overhead and are easy to build and tear down; and the stores don t require much investment. The growth formula for dollar companies, Stern said, is to build a lot of small stores that generate around $1.5 million in sales each year, and let the numbers add up. This year, Dollar General plans to open 1,000 stores, or roughly three a day.

Some wonder, though, if that breakneck pace will eventually catch up with dollar store operators. Neil Saunders, managing director of GlobalData retail, said that while their small footprint means they have  loads of head room to grow across the U.S.,  some stores have hit a saturation point in certain markets.

 In some areas stores are cannibalizing each other s sales,  he told Food Dive.

Dollar stores are also sensitive to economic pressures. Minimum wage increases could have an impact, according to Stern. And just as the recession turned many on to the dollar format, so could a flush economy give pricier competitors the chance to lure them away.

A new administration gives these issues added relevance.

 If the economy improves we may see the wind come out of their sales a bit,  said Stern.

Dollar retailers aren t waiting to see which way the wind blows. In addition to its ambitious store growth plans, Dollar General is also experimenting with new formats and growing its private label selection. Last month, the company opened DGX, a store concept aimed at urban millennials, in Nashville.

Meanwhile, Dollar Tree, which acquired Family Dollar in a $9.1 billion deal in 2014, is beginning to realize operational efficiencies from its joint venture. The number of stores under the newly formed company now number close to 14,000.

Continuing at the same frenzied pace they ve enjoyed in recent years will be challenging, sources say. Most likely, sales will grow at a more modest clip that reflects the market s maturity, consumer preferences and the various adjustments that competing retailers are making.

 I don t see their growth being as exponential as it s been in the past, but I don t think it s going away,  said George.  I think you re seeing evolution with the urban format, and I think you re going to see more and more evolution in food and consumables. 

One growth avenue George sees for dollar companies is targeting convenience stores, which offer similar goods and the same sort of fill-in shopping trips.

 They ve got c-store products at dollar store prices, and they re in the same places as c-stores,  he said.

Likewise, Saunders said growth becomes more and more difficult the larger dollar companies become. This may, he said, necessitate a change in their usual tactics, like focusing resources on existing stores in addition to opening new ones.

 We re likely to see a bigger focus on making existing stores work harder and looking at how to increase basket sizes and customer conversions in those stores,  he said.  That said, the pace of new store growth will still be extensive, especially compared to other sectors of retail. ","F&B"

And the innovations aren't over yet. C-stores are investing heavily in foodservice, hoping to attract customers at meal time with sandwiches, salads, soups and even hot bars. It appears the days of the lone hot dog rotating under a heat lamp are numbered. According to research by CSP Magazine, consumers who said they had purchased a meal solution at a c-store rose from 52% to 62% between 2010 and 2015.

With more than 180,000 connections on Facebook and 41,000 followers on Twitter, its opinion can be very persuasive.

The FDA is looking to groups like this during its public comment period to solicit feedback on guidance for the updated definition of  healthy,  just as it did in redefining  natural  last year.

The development of new sugar standards would be a timely update by the FDA. Consumer distrust of sugar is at an all-time high, and local taxes on sugary drinks were met with strong consumer support in several states last year.

The risk of losing a ""healthy"" label, an identifier that a majority of consumers seek on the products they buy, puts further pressure on manufacturers to reformulate their products. This could be achieved by swapping sugar for plant-based and natural sweeteners, such as stevia extract, agave nectar and honey. Consumer concern over health is no longer just tied to calorie counts   people want their products to be as natural as possible, and sugar has become a major no-no ingredient as a result.

Some companies have responded to this consumer trend by innovating sugar itself, rather than replacing it with an alternative. Nestle, for example, has developed a way to reconstruct the sugar molecule so that its hollow on the inside. This could allow the confection giant to cut sugar content in its products by up to 40% without sacrificing sweetness.","F&B"

This is due to each individual load requires its own unique sterilisation process. Such situations can be overcome with the new range of front-loading stackable autoclaves being introduced by British manufacturer Priorclave. It brings greater versatility to autoclave use, with the ability to sterilise two distinct loads simultaneously and each with its own sterilisation control setting.

The new stackable autoclave range initially comprises of dual 150l models and dual 200l chamber capacities models. This provides a lab manger initially looking for a 300l or 400l chamber machine the opportunity to invest in a dual 150l or 200l laboratory autoclave.

Now with added sterilising flexibility in the lab, both chambers can be used to simultaneously handle the same type of waste, with a maximum load of 300l/400l or a series of single 150l/200l loads starting as and when items become available. The real big plus factor is that the new stackable autoclaves enable laboratory staff to sterilise both waste and medium at the same time.

The alternative to achieving this flexibility is the purchase of two separate machines. The obvious downside is that double the floor space is required. For laboratories where space is accountable, this is a costly choice, not only in required footprint but that the space can be better utilised.

Priorclave's EH150 and EH200 stackable laboratory autoclaves are expected to be used extensively within many industries sectors including education, life sciences, pharmaceutical, agricultural, industrial, food and drink, and dairy and brewing.

The autoclaves are built in the UK at the company's manufacturing centre to a modular design, enabling easy upgrading during their working life as requirements change.","F&B"

With this launch, the company aims to capture a major market share in the $10bn sports nutrition market.

The company claims that its new protein ingredient has been developed for sports drinks and energy bars, and is lower in fat, sugar and carbohydrates.

Fonterra lead technologist Neil Fraser said:  People are taking more interest in their diet and health, which means as the awareness of the benefits of protein goes more mainstream, sports nutrition is no longer just for exercise fanatics.

 Protein is an important part in everyone s diet. It is needed for growth and maintenance of all cells in the body, especially muscles.

""It is a good example of getting more value out of our farmers  milk by producing higher-value products. 

 Proteins are believed to support athletic performance, but are also important for healthy ageing, especially when it comes to maintaining muscle strength and function as we get older. 

Fraser further explained that some protein ingredients have traditionally been formulated using cheese whey, whereas NZMP used lactic casein whey.

NZMP has been developing dairy protein ingredients, which are marketed under the NZMP SureProtein brand.

Fraser added:  The NZMP protein has been developed and introduced to market in less than a year through the collaboration of Fonterra s research and development centre, and operations teams. It is a good example of getting more value out of our farmers  milk by producing higher-value products. 

The company said that they are receiving orders from US sports nutrition drink producers with the launch of the NZMP SureProtein ingredient.","F&B"

"Will 2017 signal the end of the gluten-free phenomenon?","Going gluten-free has been one of the most popular diet trends of the past decade, but is the trend set to continue in 2017? Elliot Gardner finds out more.","http://www.foodprocessing-technology.com/features/featurewill-2017-signal-the-end-of-the-gluten-free-phenomenon-5730533/","Thu, 02 Feb 2017 00:00:00 GMT","NA","Will 2017 signal the end of the gluten-free phenomenon?Going gluten-free has been one of the most popular diet trends of the past decade, but is the trend set to continue in 2017? Elliot Gardner finds out more.

In 2016 the gluten-free industry continued to grow worldwide, but in one of its biggest markets, the US, the sector s annual growth rate was substantially lower last year than in the past several.

According to researchers Packaged Facts, the market grew by 81% in 2013, 30% in 2014, 11% in 2015, but just 6% in 2016. These stats have led some analysts to make the claim that the market has started to  taper off.  But heading into 2017, how can we expect the gluten-free sector to change? And why are so many taking up the diet?

Despite the fact that coeliac (celiac) disease is relatively rare, affecting 1% of Americans according to University of Chicago Celiac Disease Center figures, 36% of US consumers stated in a 2016 survey from research specialists Canadean that they were actively trying to limit their gluten consumption.

Going gluten-free has been an international health-food craze for the last several years, but there are little-to-no proven health benefits to choosing a gluten-free diet for those who are not either sufferers of coeliac disease, or who haven t been diagnosed as gluten intolerant in some way. Many claims have been made as to the diet s benefits, from clearing  brain fog  and halting weight gain, to extreme alleged assertions such as gluten avoidance alleviating the behavioural issues present in children with autism.

""Part of the increase in popularity is due to the 'free-from' regimes promoted by celebrities and online bloggers; who have condemned gluten, thus wheat-based products, as part of a healthy lifestyle"" explains Marilena Loparco, associate analyst at GlobalData Consumer, but the wider scientific community has, however, repeatedly maintained the stance that a gluten-free diet has no innate benefits to anyone not suffering from an intolerance or coeliac disease. In fact, many practitioners admit that avoiding gluten can lead to unhealthy diet choices, and even nutritional deficiencies if precautions are not taken.  It is still possible to have a healthy balanced diet. However gluten free products like breads can be significantly more expensive and also have higher levels of fat,  says Kathryn Miller, Coeliac UK s Head of Food Policy.

""It is estimated that around half a million people in the UK have coeliac disease but aren t diagnosed.""

According to Coeliac UK figures,  It is estimated that around half a million people in the UK have coeliac disease but aren t diagnosed,  which goes a long way to explaining why so many feel better when taking up a gluten free diet. This can create complications however, as it is impossible to test for coeliac disease without gluten in your system. The blood tests used to diagnose coeliac disease look for antibodies that your body produces when you eat gluten,  Miller explains.  If you are not eating foods with gluten in then these won t be detected and the test will come back saying that you do not have coeliac disease, when you may actually have it.  The answer, of course, is consulting your doctor before starting a gluten-free diet.

Why then, has the market continued to grow in the rapid manner seen over the last five years?  Few buy GF [gluten-free] foods for medical reasons in the first place. Gluten-free is becoming just another  clean label  claim,  says Packaged Facts analyst Howard Waxman.  Our online consumer survey over the years has consistently found that consumers still think it s healthier, low-carb, a weight loss diet, etc. 

But market growth is now slowing substantially. According to Packaged Facts, the compound annual growth rate of gluten-free in the US consumer market has fallen from 36% for the 2010-2015 five-year period, to an estimated 5.25% for 2015-2020. One reason may be that gluten-free is reaching its critical mass, and since so comparatively few people are prescribed the diet for medical reasons, the market has done well to maintain growth for so long.

There is also evidence to suggest that the marketing ploy to add a  gluten-free  claim to a product may also be losing its effectiveness. According to a recent Packaged Facts report, mirrored in Canadean statistics, 3 out of 4 of those purchasing gluten-free goods only did so because they were buying the product for another reason.

It is worth noting however, that simply because the market is slowing down, does not mean that it is not incredibly strong. Packaged Facts estimate 5%-6% growth year on year in the segment, so while the boom appears to be over, at least in the US, current consumers of gluten free goods appear to do so consistently, with little sign of slowing down, fuelling the health craze for the next few years at least.","F&B"

This, together with the move from solvent-based inks to water-based inks, means that the Rivercap AGL capsule reduces its emission of CO2 by 80%.

The first Snoqualmie wines to feature the new capsule are the 2014 red wines and 2015 white wines. Snoqualmie winemaker Joy Andersen says,  I m delighted that Rivercap s Absolute Green Line capsule is now a part of the Snoqualmie wine package. The AGL capsule provides a wonderful opportunity to strengthen the winery s commitment to fostering a sustainable environment. 

The new eco-friendly capsules were part of a natural progression in Snoqualmie s investment and commitment to fostering a sustainable environment. In addition to the capsules, the winery s packaging now includes the following eco-friendly elements:","Packaging"

"Parsec introduces real-time OEEE performance management solution"," The new OEE solution, built on the TrakSYS software platform, gives manufacturers unparalleled ability to monitor, measure and improve operations. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89426-parsec-introduces-real-time-oeee-performance-management-solution","Wed, 01 Feb 2017 00:00:00 -0500","NA","Parsec introduces real-time OEEE performance management solutionIn the latest example of its efforts to help manufacturers maximize performance while reducing costs and complexity, Parsec (parsec-corp.com) has launched its real-time Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) Performance Management solution. Built on the company's powerful modular manufacturing management software platform, TrakSYS , the new OEE solution gives manufacturers unparalleled ability to monitor, measure and improve operations.

The pressure to increase quality and quantity, while reducing costs, has manufacturers seeking a deeper understanding of trends and patterns and new ways to drive efficiency. The very nature of OEE is to identify the percentage of manufacturing time that is truly productive. It is the key metric for measuring the performance of an operation, but many companies measure it incorrectly, or don't measure it at all.

Most OEE measurement systems capture data from a single source and offer reports that may be visually appealing but actually contain very little substance. Other OEE systems capture lots of data but fail to give operators the necessary tools to act on that data. The TrakSYS OEE Performance Management solution collects and aggregates data from multiple sources, leveraging existing assets, resources and infrastructure, and provides insight into areas of the operation that need improvement with the tools to take action.

""We are challenging manufacturers to go beyond OEE measurement and to begin thinking about performance management,"" says Gregory Newman, Parsec vice president of marketing. ""Our TrakSYS OEE Performance Management solution pinpoints the root causes of poor performance and closes the loop by providing actionable intelligence and the tools necessary to fix the bottlenecks and improve productivity.""

The Power to Perform

 When designing the TrakSYS OEE Performance Management solution, Parsec took into account three key criteria for measuring OEE: Availability, Performance and Quality. Availability, or downtime loss, encompasses changeovers, sanitation/cleaning, breakdowns, startup/shutdown, facility problems, etc. Performance, or speed loss, includes running a production system at a speed lower than the theoretical run rate, and short stop failures such as jams and overloads. Quality, or defect loss, is defined as production and startup rejects, process defects, reduction in yield, and products that need to be reworked to conform to quality standards. As part of the solution, Parsec created a variety of standard dashboards and reports as well as the ability to customize reports through powerful web-based configuration tools.

""Our goal is to empower manufacturers to unlock unseen potential with their existing infrastructure,"" adds Newman. ""Even small tweaks can save a plant millions of dollars each year.""

TrakSYS is an integrated platform that contains all of the functionality of a full manufacturing execution system (MES) in one package. The modular nature of TrakSYS brings complete flexibility to deploy only the functions that are required, without a major software upgrade. TrakSYS business solutions include OEE, SPC, e-records, maintenance, traceability, workflow, batch processing, sustainability, labor, and more.","Packaging"
"Lessons learned from a cookie dough recall"," Earlier this fall, several major brands voluntarily recalled products due to potential listeria concerns in cookie dough ingredients.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89425-lessons-learned-from-a-cookie-dough-recall","Tue, 31 Jan 2017 10:41:00 -0500","NA","Lessons learned from a cookie dough recallEarlier this fall, several major brands voluntarily recalled products due to potential listeria concerns in cookie dough ingredients. While the cookie dough was provided by a third party supplier, these manufacturers are still ultimately responsible for the quality and safety of the final product. Ideally, preventative measures should catch quality issues before a product makes it to market, but realistically there is no way to completely eliminate the possibility of a recall. Here are some helpful tips for manufacturers to combat quality issues and avoid a costly recall.

The first step to minimizing risk is to understand if you are working with a high-risk ingredient. While it is important to have stringent quality control systems throughout your systems regardless of the status of your ingredients, it is especially important when working with high-risk foods. According to the FDA, high-risk foods are evaluated on the following factors:

Known safety risks of a particular food, taking into consideration foodborne illness data collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Likelihood that a particular food has a high potential risk for microbiological or chemical contamination

Point in the manufacturing process of the food where contamination is most likely to occur

Likelihood of contamination and steps taken during the manufacturing process to reduce the possibility of contamination

Likelihood that consuming a particular food will result in a foodborne illness due to contamination

Likely or known severity of a foodborne illness attributed to a particular food

Manufacturers should have systems in place to identify risk of suppliers based on prior performance and risk assessments. This allows manufacturers to implement risk-based testing of raw materials before they are introduced to the plant and most efficiently use resources to improve food safety.

Before manufacturers partner with a supplier, they must be thoroughly vetted. Manufacturers should make sure they have the following data for each supplier:

List of ingredients the supplier has been approved to provide each manufacturing site

Record of all certifications a manufacturer requires to do business with a supplier

If required, an updated supplier audit with audit results and supplier actions recorded

An agreed to method for advanced communication of quality issues from the supplier

It is important to make sure the supplier in question thinks about quality in the same way the manufacturer does in order to provide a consistent level of food quality. Once a relationship has been established, the true test of a supplier is how well they consistently deliver quality products in specification, at a fair price and on time.

Despite best efforts from both suppliers and manufacturers, quality events may still occur. In the event of a recall, it will take significant time and effort for a company to regain both consumer and government trust, because brand reputation is a major consideration for success in the food and beverage industry. From a government perspective, the company will likely be scrutinized more heavily by the FDA. The company may also be penalized by consumers who may not purchase the product, even after it is deemed safe.

Post-recall, F&B companies need to perform above and beyond for the next several months   or sometimes years   to be trusted by consumers and the federal government again. Establishing new or improved quality processes, increasing frequency of internal audits and leveraging technologies to automate these activities and enhance product safety are necessary actions to address quality issues. However, a successful track record of safe products is the key to rebuilding brand reputation. Eventually, after implementing a successful quality management program, F&B companies will be able to ease the minds of both consumers and the government while demonstrating that they have the ability to produce safe products.

SmartMouth Mouthwash is a product that consists of two solutions that cannot be mixed together prior to use. TricorBraun's innovative bottle improved upon the previous packaging that required two bottles, two closures, two pumps and a dosage cup. The new dual-spout bottle design simplified the dispensing system, greatly reduced the amount of packaging material, and accomplished the challenge of preventing early product activation by keeping the two solutions separated until time of use.

For Arta Tequila, TricorBraun designed a unique and complex triangular-shaped bottle. Three years in the making, the custom 750ml bottle features both embossed and debossed customer logo-shaped triangles, while the bottle's decorations consist of both screened and pressure sensitive labels.

To be considered for the World Packaging Organization's WorldStar packaging awards, a package must have already garnered recognition in a national competition. An expert panel of judges then compares those winners to similar packages from around the world and the best of them are awarded the WorldStar.","Packaging"

According to this comprehensive analysis of industry growth trends, carton shipments will increase at an average annual rate of 0.5% through 2019, and the market will climb to $8.9 billion over the same period.

  

 Prepared exclusively for PPC members by RISI, the leading provider of forest products information and data, the Trends Report offers forecasts for the future as well as insights into past performances. 2016 proved challenging for the carton market, as competition from other substrates remained strong and consumers sought out fresh food products not generally packaged in paperboard. However, the report predicts that overall consumer spending, along with other solid underlying fundamentals of the U.S. economy, will help to grow demand for folding cartons through the remainder of the current decade.

  

 The 2016 report reveals several overall trends that should further benefit the market. On the consumer side, some of the largest fast food companies and municipalities across the country have made decisions to use paper products over other substrates. Paperboard packaging is currently poised to benefit widely from its environmentally friendly character.

  

 On the supply side, a challenge for the carton industry has been the increasing cost of paperboard, which has put pressure on profitability. Trends reveals that board prices should break in the next year, as substantial tonnage is currently ramping up in Europe. Furthermore, excess board from oversupplied Chinese markets is spilling into export markets, which should further decrease board prices in the near term. 

  

 In addition to forecasts for the overall folding carton industry, Trends also includes in-depth analyses of 17 key end-use segments, including confectionery, dairy, dry foods, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, recreational products, soap and detergent, and more. This year, four categories were classified as growing markets, 10 as mature and three as declining.

  

  By showing folding carton converters where the industry has been and where it is going, PPC s Trends Report helps them hone their plans for 2017,  says Ben Markens, president of PPC.  I recommend it to all business executives, marketers, and sales teams in the industry.

","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89408-sustainability-initiatives-continue-to-advance","Fri, 27 Jan 2017 11:19:00 -0500","NA","Sustainability initiatives continue to advanceAs sustainability issues move to the forefront of the national conversation, we reached out to Tom Egan, vice president, Industry Services, PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies, to find out what the future might hold for sustainability initiatives in the consumer packaged goods industry, what considerations brands must heed and what resources are available to brands looking to make a difference.

Packaging Strategies: Given the results of the recent U.S. election and the implications with regard to environmental regulations, do you believe that sustainability is still a priority for U.S. consumers?

Tom Egan: Sustainability initiatives are here to stay. Consumers have shown a willingness to pay more for products from companies committed to a positive environmental impact.[1] They have also shown a preference for packaging that can help reduce food waste.[2] Consumers have tangible interactions with packaged goods each day. They observe trash build up first-hand, and the idea that packaging material and food waste end up in landfills is troubling to them on an intuitive level.

In looking to the future, millennials are the generation most willing to pay extra for sustainable offerings.[3] They are interested in taking more holistic approaches to the products they consume, and brands that champion environmental responsibility are earning the loyalty of a group that is poised to enter its prime spending years and economic influence.

Additionally, retailers, consumer goods manufacturers and packaging and processing suppliers are constantly working together to improve supply chain efficiencies, reduce hazardous chemicals and develop innovations that improve recyclability and reduce food and packaging waste. These initiatives are often beneficial to a company s bottom line as well. Improving production efficiencies and utilizing lighter-weight materials provide a clear cost incentive. The combination of these factors indicates that, regardless of any change to the administration, sustainability initiatives will continue to progress for consumer goods manufacturers.

PS: With regard to packaging materials, what are the most important considerations for brands to make before committing to a certain container that promises sustainability?

Egan: Today, we ask packaging to perform multiple roles, including to promote the product, assist in ease of use and inform the consumer of pertinent information. Yet the foremost responsibility of packaging and primary consideration for all brands must be to provide consumers with safe, finished goods by utilizing packaging that protects and preserves products throughout the entire supply chain. Any packaging and material decisions must first meet those principal criteria. This is especially important for managing material changes, as some modifications might have unintended consequences. For instance, a lightweighted package may reduce material use but could also result in a damaged product. This often leads to a product being thrown out or returned because the consumer was deterred from purchasing it. Trashing or returning a fully-costed product is the most expensive and unsustainable thing a brand can do. It constitutes a complete waste of all the resources that went into growing, processing, packaging and shipping that product.

When considering packaging changes that can improve sustainability, brands and consumers alike must be aware of the entire life cycle of the package. For instance, the carton that holds a tube of toothpaste may seem like an unnecessary addition to the product. Yet, due to the protection and structural stability the carton offers the tube, manufacturers have been able to lightweight the amount of resin used in the tube itself. The carton, which is sealed on both ends, also provides tamper-resistance which, in turn, boosts consumer confidence in the product. Packaging professionals must look at the whole picture in order to determine the best and most sustainable way to get a product safely to the consumer.

PS: Can you tell us a little about the resources available to manufacturers looking to address sustainability?

Egan: Technologies and solutions that can improve sustainability will be on display at the upcoming PACK EXPO East 2017 (Pennsylvania Convention Center, Philadelphia; Feb. 27-March 1), the industry s premier trade show experience in the East. Exhibitors at PACK EXPO East are almost uniformly making strides to improve sustainability. Packaging operations are to some degree inherently focused on reducing costs in energy, transportation and materials. This has a positive effect on sustainability as well. Attendees should discuss the sustainability initiatives exhibitors are undertaking when they visit each booth. They should ask about current approaches and how those might benefit their business.

Attendees should also take advantage of the PACK EXPO East Innovation Stage, where a range of stories, solutions and case histories will be shared by subject matter experts addressing sustainability, connectivity, optimal distribution and delivery and more. The Innovation Stage is right on the show floor and is free to all attendees.

For pharmaceutical professionals, the Healthcare Packaging and Processing Conference will provide an additional opportunity to learn about the latest solutions in sustainability. The conference will include sessions such as  Sustainable and Cost-Effective Cold Chain Distribution Management  (Tuesday, Feb. 28 from 10:00 a.m. to 10:45 a.m.; Room 121C). Professionals outside the pharmaceutical industry should take a look at the conference programing as well, as many times one can benefit from solutions in a different but complementary industry.

"GLAC AU Smartwater adds recyclable label to new sparkling water"," As they did with the original GLAC&Eacute;AU Smartwater label, Coca-Cola European Partners worked with Constantia Flexibles to create a pressure sensitive label that fits with the brand&rsquo;s values.&nbsp;&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89419-glac%C3%A9au-smartwater-adds-recyclable-label-to-new-sparkling-water","Fri, 27 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500","NA","GLAC AU Smartwater adds recyclable label to new sparkling waterCoca-Cola European Partners (CCEP) recently launched GLAC AU Smartwater Sparkling, a vapour distilled spring water with added electrolytes and carbonation for a clean and crisp taste. As they did with the original GLAC AU Smartwater label, CCEP worked with Constantia Flexibles (cflex.com) to create a pressure sensitive label that fits with the brand s values. The label is designed such that a message can be seen through the bottle.  Constantia Flexibles created a label using inks with the right opacity so that the design could be seen on the front of the bottle as well as on the back of the label, viewed through the water.

Additionally, it was a key priority for both CCEP and Constantia Flexibles that the labels be recyclable. Therefore, Constantia Flexibles gravure prints the labels on Avery Dennison s recyclable CleanFlake  material. This is the same material that they use on the original GLAC AU Smartwater so that rather than becoming waste, the labels will be retained and used to make new products.  The use of this material means that the GLAC AU Smartwater business will recycle around 70 tonnes of waste each year and the carbon footprint of CCEP s Morpeth factory will be reduced by approximately 80-100 tonnes of CO2 per year.

 With around half of the total carbon footprint of our products coming from packaging, we are determined to set the standard for sustainability in this area, and we were one of the first UK businesses to sign all three of the Courtauld Committee pledges. We are very excited to be working with some of the biggest organisations in the packaging and recycling spheres who share our commitment to support the circular economy,"" says Jane Buckley, operations director at CCEP Morpeth.","Packaging"
"Carton recycling reaches major milestone"," The Carton Council of North America is proud to announce that 60% of U.S. households are able to recycle food and beverage cartons through their local recycling programs.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89418-carton-recycling-reaches-major-milestone","Fri, 27 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500","NA","Carton recycling reaches major milestoneThe Carton Council of North America is proud to announce that 60% of U.S. households are able to recycle food and beverage cartons through their local recycling programs. This is an important milestone because food and beverage carton recycling is now available to a substantial majority of consumers and, according to the Federal Trade Commission green guidelines, can now carry the standard  Please Recycle  logo.

The Carton Council formed in 2009 with the goal to grow carton recycling. Understanding that access is the cornerstone to increasing recycling, the Carton Council has focused on building an infrastructure in the U.S. for recycling aseptic and gable-top cartons used for many common food and beverage products. Prior to forming, only 18% of households could recycle their food and beverage cartons. Now 60% of households can   a 233% increase.

 This is an important milestone that could not have been achieved without the hard work and collaboration among our public and private partners,   says Jason Pelz, vice president of recycling projects for the Carton Council of North America.  We share this celebration with everyone who helped to make carton recycling unequivocally mainstream. 

 This is a win for all interested in recycling,  adds Nina Goodrich, director, Sustainable Packaging Coalition.  We have been happy to work with the Carton Council and recognize the efforts behind this achievement. Increasing the materials that can be recycled in this country helps the environment and contributes to the circular economy. 

The amount of products packaged in cartons in the U.S. has grown significantly, thanks in part to cartons  environmental profile. Milk and non-dairy beverages, juices, coconut and standard water, broth and soups, wine, and even tomatoes and beans can be found in aseptic and/or gable-top cartons.

 It is now more important than ever to make sure consumers know that cartons can and should be recycled,  says Derric Brown, vice president of sustainability for the Carton Council of North America.  Companies and brands with carton packaging are encouraged to use the recycling logo. Research the Carton Council conducted reveals that the packaging is overwhelmingly the first place people go to check its recyclability. Additionally, more than two-thirds of consumers say they would assume a package is not recyclable if it did not have a recycling symbol or language on it. 

Leveraging the strong foundation built with significant access, the Carton Council remains committed to advancing sustainable carton recycling in the U.S. and increasing carton recycling rates. On February 1st, the Carton Council will launch a new consumer-facing website and a national digital education campaign designed to engage consumers and encourage them to recycle their cartons. Interested companies and brands can get involved by emailing Carton.Recycling@hkstrategies.com for more information and to obtain materials and resources.

The Carton Council, in its mission to grow carton recycling in the U.S., will continue to work with all stakeholders in the carton recycling value chain, to further drive access, recovery and recycling of cartons.","Packaging"

","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89410-dow-canvera-polyolefin-dispersions-gain-industry-recognition","Thu, 26 Jan 2017 00:00:00 -0500","NA","Dow CANVERA Polyolefin Dispersions gain industry recognitionRecent R&D 100 Award and ICIS Innovation Award wins for CANVERA  Polyolefin Dispersions from Dow Coating Materials (DCM, dowcoatingmaterials.com), a business unit of The Dow Chemical Company, validate their fresh approach to can coatings. These industry accolades substantiate this novel technology as an effective, drop-in alternative to incumbent epoxy-based metal can coatings. CANVERA Dispersions offer progressive food and beverage brand owners, can makers and coatings formulators a long-term metal can packaging solution that addresses growing consumer interest in can coatings that exclude Bisphenol-A (BPA) and other materials of concern to consumers.

 CANVERA Polyolefin Dispersions are a market disruptor that helps make the food and beverage industry safer and more sustainable,  says Jonathan Mason, associate research director, Dow Coating Materials.  They allow us to use the same trusted chemistry on which we ve relied for decades in flexible and rigid food packaging in the thin-film coatings that line metal cans. Now we can achieve a safety profile that regulators and consumers alike prefer while keeping canned foods and beverages flavorful and fresh. 

The technology recently received a 2016 R&D 100 Award in the Mechanical/Materials category, as well as a 2016 R&D 100 Special Recognition Silver Award as a Market Disruptor. Referred to as the  Oscars of Innovation,  the R&D 100 Awards honor products and technologies released in the last year that make a significant impact within the research and development community.

These honors came on the heels of CANVERA Dispersions winning the 2016 ICIS Best Product Innovation Award. The well-respected ICIS Innovation Awards recognize and reward innovative and sustainability-minded companies, products and individuals in the chemical industry.

CANVERA Dispersions are enabled through BLUEWAVE  Technology, a proprietary process developed by the Dow Core R&D group. This process mechanically disperses polymers into water to form emulsions with performance attributes typically reserved for solvent-based systems. To create CANVERA Dispersions, the Dow Core R&D and DCM R&D teams collaborated to disperse polyolefins into water.

As water-based emulsions, CANVERA Dispersions offer coatings formulators the flexibility to meet direct food contact requirements and can makers the flexibility to spray-apply the coatings. The post-spray bake step melts the polyolefin coatings, providing excellent adhesion and corrosion protection.

Can makers also benefit from coatings based on CANVERA Dispersions, which offer a drop-in can lining solution that can maintain long-term process efficiencies. By leveraging existing infrastructure and application equipment, manufacturers do not require production downtime during conversion. CANVERA Dispersions may even increase productivity by contributing to lighter coating weights and increased line speeds through controlled spray application.","Packaging"

"Chemical labeling with ECLs"," Expanded content labels (ECL) are a multi-paneled labeling option designed to display extensive amounts of information.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89403-chemical-labeling-with-ecls","Tue, 24 Jan 2017 10:39:00 -0500","NA","Chemical labeling with ECLsExpanded content labels (ECL) are a multi-paneled labeling option designed to display extensive amounts of information. ECLs can convey an abundance of information   ingredients, regulations, pictograms, languages and more.

There are multiple types of ECLs and can range from a couple of pages up to 70 page books. Depending on the need, many of the labels can be structured in different ways to deliver different amounts of pages. All ECL options are versatile in application and customizable, to an extent to fit any packages exact needs.

When considering an ECL for a household or commercial chemical product, manufacturers need to ask what they want to accomplish with the label. Is the label s sole purpose to comply with a regulation or is it designed to enhance the value of the package? Thanks to ECLs  flexibility, the label can fit both bills   an effective marketing tool that displays all of the required information to meet regulations.

In many instances, an ECL is a necessity for a chemical manufacturer s product, but there are still many things to consider.

What regulations do chemical labels need to meet?

The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA; osha.gov) changed certain regulations for their Hazard Communication Standard (HCS) in 2015 and 2016. These regulations were changed to align with the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labeling of Chemicals (GHS). The changes were made to provide a coherent standard for classifying chemicals, and communicating hazardous information on labels and safety data sheets. Chemical manufacturers must have labels that include but are not limited to:

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA; epa.gov) also has requirements for chemical labeling. The EPA s requirements include similar items found in OSHA s requirements like precautionary statements and a signal word. The EPA s other requirements include but are not limited to:

Complying with the law requires many pieces of information to be displayed. An ECL is an ideal option to meet compliance without sacrificing the brands real estate on a label.

What branding/marketing options can increase the label s effectiveness?

A manufacturer s ECL can convey more than regulations and legal requirements. Marketing driven labels promote brand awareness and enhance the value of the package. A well designed ECL will ensure compliance without limiting the brand. With the additional pages, there are many options for information to include such as multilingual panels, non-regulatory pictograms and promotions.

What other considerations need to be taken when designing a label?

Design options for ECLs are vast and varied   type of material, the way it adheres, number of pages and fold design for those pages along with the actual graphics. Regulations and marketing decisions will play heavily into what design options are ideal for an ECL, but it is also important to consider the product s environmental needs when making design decisions. Environmental aspects to consider are but not limited to:

Extended content labels can be much more than a simple option to meet regulations for chemical labeling. With the extended content possibilities, ECLs can convey so much information in a unique way without limiting, but instead, improving the brand.

Joe Braman knew that those same talents applied to beer, thus the launch of five new Running Walker craft beers: IPA, Stout, Pilsner, Kolsch and Texas Secession.

Braman describes the new beers as the result of raising the bar on quality across the craft beer category. ""Each beer here is unique,"" he says. ""We use the highest quality ingredients. They are not just crafted, but 'hand-crafted' to yield the best possible product. We take our time on each brew, never rushing the process, so that our customers get a great craft beer experience with every can.""

Braman Brands is proud to introduce a new line of craft beer products in beverage cans by Ardagh Group (ardaghgroup.com). The cans protect beverage quality and integrity as well as deliver a favorable drinking experience by cooling fast and remaining cold for a long period of time.

Braman cites an additional benefit. ""My whole life has been about taking care of this bountiful land, so little things that help preserve the environment can become big things,"" he says. ""Cans are recycled at a high rate, so we're committed to a long-term positive impact for our product and packaging.""

"Nestl  USA To Move Headquarters To Virginia","Nestle USA announced Feb. 1 that it will transition its corporate headquarters from Glendale, Calif. to Arlington County, Va., beginning later this year.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2017/nestle-usa-to-move-headquarters-to-virginia/","Thu, 02 Feb 2017 12:58:00 -0500","NA","Nestl  USA To Move Headquarters To VirginiaNestle USA announced Feb. 1 that it will transition its corporate headquarters from Glendale, Calif. to Arlington County, Va., beginning later this year. The move marks an important milestone in the company s history and signals Nestl  s commitment to future investment and growth in the U.S.

The move demonstrates Nestle's leadership in responding to rapid changes in the food industry, the company says, with a new, more efficient structure, and is closer proximity to the majority of its business and stakeholders. The company expects to bring approximately 750 jobs to the Washington, D.C. area with this transition.

""With the food and beverage landscape continuing to transform at a rapid pace, Nestl  has been innovating and making strategic changes to the business over the past five years. This move is the next step in our evolution,"" stated Paul Grimwood, chairman and CEO of Nestl  USA in a press release. ""We carefully considered a number of options and Arlington hits all the marks. Not only is it attractive to our current employees while offering a great talent pool for the future, but this location allows us to be closer to our business operations, our customers and other important stakeholders.""

Currently, 75 percent of Nestl 's U.S. plants and 85 percent of its top customers are located in the eastern half of the U.S. With most key regulatory groups and non-government organizations pertinent to the business located in or near the Washington, D.C. area, the move will further facilitate important conversations about bringing the best foods and beverages to U.S. consumers.

The Arlington location will become home to Nestl 's Beverage and Confections & Global Foods divisions, as well as its expanding eBusiness team, Center for Marketing Excellence and team of nutrition experts. The move is expected to be finalized by the of 2018.

Nestle USA will move its technical and production organization and supply chain teams to join the Nestl  Prepared Foods, Pizza, Baking and Professional businesses in Solon, Ohio. The company has established Solon as its Center of Excellence for frozen and chilled foods businesses, with major brands that lead their categories, and as the site for its $50-million investment in the global Nestl  Development Center, dedicated to transforming the way the world enjoys frozen and chilled foods.

While transitioning Nestl  USA from its current location in Glendale, Nestl  says it remains committed to California, with approximately 5,500 employees across the state. Businesses including Nestl  Dreyer s Ice Cream, Nestl  Purina PetCare and Nestl  Waters North America maintain nine manufacturing facilities there.","F&B"

"How To Upgrade Pest Control Programs In Food Plants","Greater involvement by plant personnel can result in best-in-class pest management.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2017/how-to-upgrade-pest-control-programs/","Tue, 31 Jan 2017 16:41:00 -0500","NA","How To Upgrade Pest Control Programs In Food PlantsWith the Food Safety Modernization Act (FSMA) enforcement era well under way, food and beverage companies are intensifying efforts to upgrade their food safety defenses, with more rigorous worker training topping the list, Food Processing s 16th annual Manufacturing Outlook Survey found.

Three out of four food professionals who participated in the survey indicated a greater emphasis on training as a food safety priority in 2017. Most of those respondents   and 41.4 percent of all survey participants   also say their companies are taking a hard look at pest control as an area for improvement.

Two-thirds of the survey sample indicated their plants have outsourced pest control responsibilities, making pest management the most frequently outsourced service. But out of house doesn t mean out of mind, given the criticality of the task. Keeping production and packaging spaces free of insects, rodents and other uninvited guests is fundamental. Even if public health inspectors don t shut a plant down, independent auditors take a dim view of deficiencies in this area: As much as 20 percent of food-safety audit scores are based on pest control.

Whether pest control is handled in-house or outsourced, past results are no guarantee of future performance. Continuous improvement is the only way to prevent backsliding. With that in mind, here are 10 ways to improve performance and outcomes in food-plant pest control.

Some firms are going beyond certificates of analysis from suppliers to ensure that biological hazards are not entering through the receiving dock. The primary concern is raw materials, ingredients and primary packaging, but incoming shipments also can usher in rodents, insects and other pests.

Ron Harrison, technical services director at Atlanta-based Orkin Commercial Services (www.orkin/commercial.com), cites the pharmaceutical manufacturer that moved pallets of materials directly from the unloading dock to a clean room. With wooden pallets the dominant material carrier in food & beverage facilities, the likelihood that a pallet will contaminate processing areas is real.

Instead of a single contact person at client facilities, pest-control technicians are communicating with multiple individuals at food plants to ensure recommended improvements are enacted.

Few if any changes in regulations or guidances for pest control exist in FSMA, but the corrective actions at the heart of the hazard analysis and risk prevention approach apply as much to current good manufacturing practices as they do to food safety. Preventive controls are a response to hazard analysis, and each analysis is specific to a particular facility and the types of products and ingredients made there.

Monitoring of light traps, rodent traps and other devices is a starting point for preventive control, but monitoring demands a framework, points out Patricia Hottel, technical director at McCloud Services (mccloudservices.com) in South Elgin, Ill. How those monitors are used and what circumstances trigger a corrective action must be defined, along with an acceptable threshold for detected pests.

Manufacturers should specify what results trigger a corrective action, she adds. If a rodent enters the building because a dock door was left open, that doesn t mean the prevention system failed, only that procedures weren t followed. On the other hand, chronically exceeding threshold levels of trapped beetles and cockroaches indicates the program isn t working and requires change.

Root cause analysis is essential.  When a problem occurs, it s a symptom, not a solution,  Hottel emphasizes. Understanding why it occurred is necessary before determining if the event exposed a fundamental weakness or a one-time event.

A band makes better music than a soloist. Likewise, a collaborative effort involving sanitation, maintenance, quality assurance and other disciplines is more effective than fobbing responsibilities off on a single individual, be it a staff member or service company technician.

 A good New Year s resolution would be to work on those relationships and have good communications,  advises Jerry Heath, an entomologist at IFF (www.indfumco.com) in Lenexa, Kan.  Everybody in the facility can be part of inspection. 

 The pest control program needs to be weaved in such a way that it isn t somebody else s problem,  seconds Dominique Sauvage, director-field operations & quality for Menomonee Falls, Wis.-based Copesan Services Inc. (www.copesan.com).  A lot of times, a service technician is hired to solve a problem, but without the participation of plant personnel, the problem likely will recur. 

The French minister of war thought the Maginot Line was an impenetrable defense. German forces found a way around it; a month later, Nazis were quaffing champagne on the Champs  lys e.

Yesterday s outcomes don t guarantee tomorrow s success.  The unexpected is going to pop up at some time,  observes Richard Kammerling, president of RK Pest Management Services in Huntington Station, N.Y. Instead of a rote approach to inspection, personnel should challenge themselves with what-if questions while bracing for the unexpected.","F&B"

The awards coincide with food businesses throughout the supply chain looking to further strengthen their food safety systems, meet new regulatory requirements, expand market access and reinforce consumer confidence in the safety of the products they buy.

""At GFSI, we want to raise the profile of companies around the world implementing this capability building program and celebrate the work that's already having an impact,"" said V ronique Discours-Buhot, GFSI's director at The Consumer Goods Forum.

This first GFSI award puts the spotlight on companies who have leveraged the GFSI Global Markets Program from beginning to end, resulting in full certification to a GFSI-benchmarked food safety management scheme, according to the organization. Winners will be named at the GFSI Conference. The opportunity is made possible through the generous support of Greenfence, a remote auditing and certification platform for the food industry.

""To apply or nominate someone for this award is to help raise awareness around these incredibly important efforts,"" adds Peter Begg, conference committee chair. Applications are open until Feb. 7. The GFSI Global Markets Program assists companies who lack or have underdeveloped food safety systems in addressing their challenges. The program provides an unaccredited entry point with a step-by-step program designed to build production and manufacturing operations capabilities and implement a course of continuous improvement.

The 16th edition of GFSI's flagship conference will gather delegates from 60 countries and a speaker lineup including eight CEOs from ""industry heavyweights."" It will highlight how GFSI serves as a driver to the food safety ecosystem and how companies can leverage GFSI for growth, no matter where in the supply chain they operate, the group says.

"Squeezing the Colors out of Fruits and Vegetables","Health concerns about ingredients in processed foods have changed the color palette to hues with simpler, cleaner ingredients. The heightened awareness about additives means manufacturers must continue reformulating products, which promises both challenges and opportunities.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2017/squeezing-the-colors-out-of-fruits-and-vegetables/","Mon, 30 Jan 2017 14:54:00 -0500","NA","Squeezing the Colors out of Fruits and Vegetables""Tasting the Rainbow,"" as the Skittles slogan goes, soon will no longer involve consuming loads of Yellow 5, Blue 1 and Red 40. Instead, it might mean stealth consumption of paprika, beets and tomato.

Ingredient suppliers have figured out how to tap fruits and vegetables and other natural sources for colors. And just in time, as food and beverage processors, bowing to consumer demands, are racing to substitute natural colorants for synthetic ones.

Carrots are a good source of orange and yellow, and a naturally red variety of carrots is being mined for that color. Reds also can be extracted from the lycopene in tomatoes. Shades from red to purple can come from beets or elderberries. More purples can be extracted from purple varieties of corn or sweet potatoes.

Sweet potatoes are an interesting option because they have great color stability. Studies show purple sweet potatoes provide intense color and a wider color range   from raspberry red to grapelike purple   than other deeply hued fruits or vegetables. Another plus, purple sweet potatoes are loaded with anthocyanins the substances that give blueberries their hue and make them nutritious.

Processors have used color additives for years to enhance or cover up the lack of natural color in foods such as confections, meats, bakery products and snacks, as well as to offset color loss from light, air and temperature exposure. Colors also add value to a product. Put simply, Orange Crush wouldn't be orange without colorants.

But as more research claims artificial coloring is linked with increased hyperactivity in children, cancer and other maladies and sensitivities, food companies are tasked with phasing out synthetic colors, and can't seem to do it soon enough to suit some food advocates.

Food companies also must contend with economics as well as maintaining product quality, safety and shelf life. Equally crucial, natural colorants don't behave the same way as the easy-to-use, lower-cost, stable synthetics.

Natural colors have a reputation for having a higher per-unit cost, and a sometimes lower color content can escalate the costs of their use. Some ""naturals"" aren't as reliable or consistent, depending on the application, and typically have a shorter shelf life and vary in shade unlike than their FD&C counterparts. Given the differences in solubility, care must be taken to find the right formulation of for each product application.

Back to beets: The extract colorant, betanin, degrades more rapidly in high water activity environments after exposure to heat, which also drives a browning reaction between other components of the ingredient.

Finding heat-stable natural reds has been a challenge for baked goods companies because the colors can shift during heat processing from red to purple as their pH changes or to brown during baking. But heat-resistant reds are being perfected.

While it's not a fruit or vegetable, algae is at least natural and plant-based. Spirulina, a strain of algae, provided a natural solution for one of the toughest colors to match. In mid-2013, the FDA approved a petition from Mars Inc. to use spirulina derivatives for blue and green colors in candy and gums. FDA approval has since been extended to other applications.

Perhaps that enabled Mars to make a commitment last February to remove all artificial colors from all its human food products (not just Skittles).

""Removing all artificial colors from a human food portfolio that features more than 50 brands represents a complex challenge,"" CEO Grant Reid said at the time. And it will take years.

Similar efforts are under way at Mondelez, Kellogg and General Mills. General Mills made the commitment in June 2015, noting ""more than 60 percent of General Mills cereals like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and original Cheerios are already without artificial flavors and colors from artificial sources and have been that way for a long time."" The company expected to have more than 90 percent of the portfolio free of artificial flavors and colors from artificial sources by the end of 2016.

""Trix will now use ingredients like fruit and vegetable juices and spice extracts such as turmeric and annatto to achieve the fun red, yellow, orange and purple colors,"" said Kate Gallager, General Mills cereal developer.  Cereals that contain marshmallows, like Lucky Charms, may take longer, but we are committed to finding a way to keep the magically delicious taste as we work to take out the artificial flavors and colors from artificial sources. 

There may need to be trade-offs. Note that Gallager listed only four colors of Trix; there used to be six. New Trix doesn't have blue and green puffs because suitable replacements for those colors could not be found.

Kraft Heinz has removed artificial colors from Kraft's Macaroni & Cheese and Capri Sun juice drinks, as well as other products.

Jelly Belly's (www.jellybelly.com) Snapple, Superfruit and Organic lines use natural colorants. Its other confections free of artificial colors include Sunkist Fruit Gems and Sunkist Orange Slices. All ingredients in the organic Jelly Belly jelly beans are also made with non-GMO ingredients and natural flavors, says Rob Swaigen, vice president of global marketing at the Fairfield, Calif.-based company.

Panera Bread announced in mid-January it completed its previously announced goal of removing all artificial colors, flavors, preservatives and sweeteners from its products. In May of 2015, the restaurant chain made news by publishing a list of more than 150 ingredients it was working to remove from its U.S. food menu, as well as its portfolio of Panera at Home products. How? Panera reviewed more than 450 ingredients and reformulated 122 products, resulting in changes to most of its bakery-cafe recipes. It partnered with more than 300 food vendors to find solutions from ingredient replacements to rethinking how foods are prepared.

Back to spirulina: Noting the ingredient's use is expanding by double digits, Earthwise Nutritionals, a Irvine, Calif., a subsidiary of DIC Corp. (www.dic-global.com), is expanding production capacities for spirulina-derived blue food coloring and other colors. Its new facilities are slated to go onstream in 2018.

And Roha, which already has an extensive portfolio of natural food colors, just last month bought Essential Srl, an Italian manufacturer of fruit- and plant-based natural colors. Roha noted the interest in natural colors is every bit as strong in Europe as it is here in the States.","F&B"

"Scheduled Downtime: Agricultural Subsidies Spur Pork Supply Chain Growth in Michigan","Farmers drive plan to create more favorable hog and bean pricing and to weaken processors  grip on the market.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2017/downtime-agricultural-subsidies-pork-supply-chain/","Wed, 25 Jan 2017 13:25:00 -0500","NA","Scheduled Downtime: Agricultural Subsidies Spur Pork Supply Chain Growth in MichiganIt s generally assumed that increased demand drives capacity growth, though over-capacity in U.S. food production can put a damper on new plant projects.

Business decisions are more complex, of course, and another consideration in greenfield projects is economic development incentives. A case in point is the hog processing facility being built in Coldwater, Mich.

Clemens Food Group heads the $255.7 million project, with plenty of involvement from hog farmers in Ohio, Indiana and southwestern Michigan. The Michigan contingent laid the groundwork several years ago, aided by state economic development authorities who underwrote a feasibility study. Their involvement helps explain the $33.8 million incentive package that the Michigan Economic Development Corp. (MEDC) says state and local governments have committed to the project (Good Jobs First pegs the value at $80.2 million).

Realizing a return on such a sizable subsidy from a mid-sized packinghouse is tough to compute until the total supply chain is considered. A network of hog growers is required to keep production humming, and those hogs need lots of feed to reach market weight in a matter of months. Throw in the farmers who raise the feed crops, and the financial impact on Michigan agribusiness runs well into nine figures.

The Clemens project also highlights the impact a small group of food industry players can have. Ground never would have been broken in Coldwater without such a group. A key mover and shaker was Harley Sietsema.

The patriarch of Allendale, Mich.-based Sietsema Farms brings 750,000 hogs and 1.4 million turkeys to market each year. As recently as 1998, the continued viability of livestock production in western Michigan looked shaky. First, Sara Lee shuttered its Bil-Mar turkey plant, then Thornapple Valley pulled the plug on what was the state s last remaining fresh pork plant.

America s insatiable appetite for bacon helps explain a spate of new pork plants coming on line, including Clemens Food Group s project, which received a generous subsidy from Michigan governmental units. Photo: Tyson Foods

Transporting live birds to plants in Indiana and Iowa would erode margins, and consolidation in the turkey segment relegated independent growers to the spot market and uncertain demand, so Sietsema and other farmers formed the Michigan Turkey Processors Cooperative. Backed by $30 million in capital, most of it from the co-op members, they acquired a shuttered Simplot potato processing facility in Wyoming, Mich., gutted and rebuilt it for USDA slaughter operations in 2000.

One plant innovation was its carbon dioxide stunning system, a first for U.S. turkey slaughter. Engineered in-house, the system now is used at several other turkey facilities. Michigan Turkey Producers has since added a further processing plant that s helping generate more than $200 million in annual sales.

 It was either do or die with turkeys,  recalls Sietsema,  but in the pork industry, there still are a lot of independent producers.  An effort to organize hog producers along the lines of the turkey co-op floundered, but a decade later, consolidation had reshaped the processing landscape.

 By 2010-2012, the processors were able to establish the market value,  he continues. Sietsema and a handful of other hog farmers lobbied the state for $100,000 to conduct a feasibility study on building a Michigan packinghouse. Armed with a favorable economic conclusion, they began knocking on doors, looking for someone with an established brand to take on the role of processing partner. The search ended in Hatfield, Pa., where Clemens goes to market with multiple brands.

Michigan hog farmers are clear beneficiaries of the project, which will temper rising freight costs and provide more favorable hog prices, but the bigger picture intrigued state officials. The Coldwater plant, expected to start production in autumn, will process roughly 1.6 million hogs a year, calculates Jamie Clover Adams, director of the Michigan Dept. of Agriculture and Rural Development, more than existing hog operations can supply. She expects 100-140 new Michigan hog farms to commence operations in the coming years.

She fixed  the break-even point  for hog farming at 5,000 head, a level sufficient to trigger odor complaints from neighbors. But  Michigan has a very strong Right to Farm law,  she added.  If you site the facility correctly, it can t be labeled a nuisance. 

Already, hogs consume 8.8 percent of the state s soybean crop and 6.8 percent of corn, figures expected to grow significantly. But 90 percent of soybeans are shipped out of state for processing, at a cost of 25-40 cents per bushel.  Twenty-five cents might be the farmers  profit margin for the foreseeable future,  grimaces Clover Adams. To change the equation, state and local governments are providing $27.3 million in assistance for a new bean processing facility in Ithaca, Mich. The plant will have enough capacity to process half the state s bean crop.

The soybean subsidy would not have happened without Clemens, which Clover Adams called  a transformative project for our state.  Intrastate trucking, veterinary services and feed mill operations are some of the other supply-chain activities that the pork project will stimulate.

The Coldwater site initially will process 10,000 hogs a day, with potential for 20,000 if a second shift is added.

That puts it in the same league as Prestage Farms and Seaboard Triumph Foods, two Iowa pork plants coming on line this year. That s a lot of added capacity, but given Americans  insatiable taste for pork products (bacon-infused vodka, anyone?), demand exists. Barring a trade war that could choke off U.S. food exports, the state of Michigan just might get a return on its largesse.","F&B"
"Editor's Plate Reheated: Letters to the Editor","Food Processing readers react and respond to recent issues.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2017/02-letters-to-the-editor/","Wed, 25 Jan 2017 11:54:00 -0500","NA","Editor's Plate Reheated: Letters to the EditorThe following letters recently appeared in our February 2017 issue of Food Processing magazine.

I'm a big fan of Food Processing magazine. But I'd like to share my point of view after reading the Editor's Plate in November, which may be the perspective of other readers as well.

The piece finished with you stating that you're a ""big supporter"" of freedom of speech, yet was adversarial against Kaepernick's free speech actions. Not strongly adversarial, but adversarial nonetheless. Certainly, it didn't offer any praise for his efforts.

Instead of criticizing Kaepernick's right to protest, perhaps it would have been a less divisive article had you bridged his protest, which has been very successful achieving broad media attention to the subject (which was his point), with the fantastic entrepreneurial efforts of two of his predecessors, Franco Harris and Lydell Mitchell.

Police brutality is a sensitive issue and not just for black Americans. For many citizens affected by this, his silent protest IS inspiring. Heck, people are talking about police brutality in a food processing magazine! Thus, to say he isn't ""making a difference"" might be unfair.

A half-million kids under the age of 5 will die again this year due to vitamin-A deficiency in the Third World. GMO Golden Rice could provide the nutrients to prevent blindness and death, but it has been awaiting approval for over a decade thanks largely to organic activists who claim this crop will threaten organic crops.

As someone who worked for five years as a USDA organic inspector, please let me assure you that nothing could be further from the truth. Not only will GMO Golden Rice alleviate the suffering of millions, it could also   in point-of-fact   be grown organically! So I joined with 11 scientists and wrote an article last year in The Daily Caller about producing the world s first organic-GMO crop. I then wrote a brief follow-up immediately after Mr. Trump won the presidency.

Would you please help get the word out about this? GMO Golden Rice has been given to the world free of charge by its inventor, Dr. Ingo Potrykus. All that stands in its way is the lack of political will.

I hope Mr. Trump's new Secretary of Agriculture understands this issue. Organic activists claim GMOs threaten organic crops. But, as is often the case with anti-everything activists, they have never bothered to read their own federal standards for organic production.

I was hoping I could somehow get your help on an Idea I have. Our country's food banks need help. No one in America should ever go hungry, so why do they? How much money do Americans spend on food each year? And how much money do these companies make? A lot! So why can't they donate to our food banks and keep the shelves well stocked? Maybe we can start some kind of bill to take before congress so these major companies have to donate 5 percent of their profit in food.

Food banks run out of food and people get turned away, and what they give you for a family of four will last three days if you're lucky. What is wrong with this picture? Why are we so concerned with money and not concerned with the greater good for the community?

Editor's note: Every major food company I know gives generously -- in product, cash and volunteer hours -- to food banks, either local ones or national ones. Foremost among them is Feeding America. Make sure your company is on its list of donors. Individuals can donate, too. See feedingamerica.org.

"Power Lunch: The Path Toward Sustainable and Pesticide-Free Cacao","Latest innovations can improve sustainability in cacao production and enhance brand value of chocolate.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2017/power-lunch-sustainable-pesticide-free-cacao/","Wed, 25 Jan 2017 10:30:00 -0500","NA","Power Lunch: The Path Toward Sustainable and Pesticide-Free CacaoIf you stumbled upon a five-dollar bill on the sidewalk, couldn t find its owner and then had an intense craving for quality chocolate, which would you rather buy: chocolate in a conventional package or a beautifully wrapped product that provides details about the origin of the cocoa, the farmers who cultivated it and the techniques used to eliminate pesticides?

A brand s story plays an important role in establishing its value. Increasingly, a brand s sustainability attributes are a strategic differentiator that enables food companies to connect with consumers and drive brand loyalty. For chocolate, many of the world s largest manufacturers are already taking meaningful steps to improve social and environmental responsibility throughout their supply chains.

Technology is rapidly improving our ability to trace ingredients back to the source. Soon, consumers will be able to follow the entire cacao value chain from field to store. Cacao traders like ECOM, as well as integrated cacao procurement and food processors like Cargill, Olam and Barry Callebaut stand to gain by working with manufacturers to deliver more detailed information about social and environmental responsibility at the source of origin.

Large manufacturers like Mars (through its Sustainable Cocoa Initiative), Mondelez (through its Cadbury Cocoa Partnership), Nestl  (through Nestl  Cocoa Plan) and Hershey (through its CocoaLink and Learn to Grow programs) have increasingly supported sustainability programs that are making their way into brand communications.

Unfortunately, most of the world s five million smallholder cacao farmers live in poverty and remain vulnerable to adverse health effects from heightened pesticide exposure. To maximize yields and prevent crop loss in areas with heavy tropical rains, cash-strapped farmers often resort to extensive spraying of generic, off-patent insecticides with little to no protective measures.

What if cacao production wasn t so dependent on toxic pesticides? Is there a way to chart a course to a pesticide-free brand of cacao? A new crop protection technology, which leverages the latest scientific developments in materials science, offers a solution: a non-toxic, biodegradable crop protection product that can be applied not only to cacao but to all plant surfaces including fruit, leaves, stems, and seeds. The coating prevents pests and pathogens from damaging crops.

This approach enables farmers to disrupt the pest lifecycle while minimizing or even eliminating the use of unfriendly chemicals. Field trials are under way around the world for both cacao and coffee (as well as other crops), with encouraging results in terms of yield enhancement, labor cost reduction, and toxic pesticide mitigation.

We believe that materials science innovations such as this can increase crop yields, lower agricultural input costs, and improve the economic livelihood of cacao farmers around the globe. And it s not limited to cacao. I m so excited to be part of a worldwide movement   which is also a tremendous opportunity   to give farmers the tools they need to transition from conventional to sustainable farming.

It s just as important for manufacturers to communicate new innovations to consumers through their brands. Even for a guilty pleasure like chocolate, many consumers look for ways to make ethical decisions. In the case of cacao, sustainability communication usually takes the form of third-party certification through Fair Trade, Rainforest Alliance Certified and Utz programs. Specialty chocolate manufacturers often promote single origin, direct trade and bean-to-bar production (such as Dandelion Chocolate in San Francisco).

And demand for this information is rising fast. According to Nielsen s 2015 Global Sustainability Report, 66 percent of consumers expressed a willingness to pay more for brands that they believe are sustainable a rise from 55 percent in 2014 and 50 percent in 2013.

It will take ongoing partnerships between agriculture technology companies and the world s largest chocolate manufacturers and non-governmental organizations (such as the World Cocoa Foundation) to bring safer, sustainable agricultural practices to the smallholder.

The opportunity for innovative, effective, nature-derived crop protection is huge. Beyond offering growers of high-value crops like cacao and coffee a way to minimize or even eliminate the use of pesticides while improving yield, field-level technologies can address two key challenges in the developing world: increasing food production and fostering the development of sustainable agricultural practices that are environmentally friendly and economically viable.

Consumers are increasingly eager to participate in this effort.

"How to Choose the Right Oil for Your Product Formulations","John Sandbakken, Executive Director of the National Sunflower Association, addresses questions from food manufacturers on what to consider when choosing an oil for product formulations.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2017/right-oil-for-product-formulations/","Tue, 24 Jan 2017 13:13:00 -0500","NA","How to Choose the Right Oil for Your Product FormulationsAs the demand for cleaner labels continues to grow, many food manufacturers are looking more closely at the ingredients in their products and the type of fat or oil requires important consideration

Q. Have you considered switching to a non-GMO oil?

A. With greater consumer interest in non-GMO ingredients, and with 89 percent of Americans indicating that they would like some form of GMO-labeling on their food , a non-GMO oil, such as sunflower oil, will contribute to a cleaner product label and could give your products a competitive advantage.



Q. Does your product need a fat or an oil that will give it a longer shelf life?

A. Some fats and oils have a high Omega 3/linolenic fatty acid content. While these fatty acids could potentially add health benefits to a product, they are not very stable, and as a result they limit a product s shelf life.   If you are interested in stretching the shelf life of a bakery product, a sauce or a snack food product, research has shown that choosing an oil with a high oleic fatty acid content, such as sunflower oil, will provide longer shelf life.

Q. Are you looking for a trans fat free oil to replace PHOs?

A. Removing PHOs from your product may require a new combination of fats and oils. Sun oil could be a substitute for the PHO that you are currently using and it can also be blended with other fats and oils so your product s taste and texture is not compromised.



Q. Is it important to have an oil with a neutral taste?

A. Some fats and oils have a flavor profile that might conflict or overpower the flavors in your product. Sun oil has a neutral taste allowing the true flavors in foods to come through.

Q. Do you need a fat or oil that has a high heat point and a long fry life?

A. Fatty acid composition of oil has an impact on frying stability and also affects the length of time oil will last in a fryer. Several fry-life studies show that sunflower oil has a very high smoke point and a longer fry life than many other oils. Its composition makes it ideal for deep-fried or par-fried foods.

Q. Would you like to use an oil that offers your customers health benefits?

A. Most plant-based oils offer a variety of health benefits and choosing a trans fat free oil has many proven benefits. Sunflower oil is an excellent source of Vitamin E, a nutrient that contributes to positive heart health. Sun oil can also be used as a partial substitute for saturated fat in some food formulations including crackers, cookies, sausages and dairy products.  The end result is often a healthier product with the same taste and texture.

Q. Are you interested in choosing an oil that will please your customers?

A. Americans have a very positive perception of sunflower oil.  In fact, a 2015 study conducted by the International Food Information Council Foundation  found that 56 percent of Americans rated sunflower oil as either  extremely healthful  or  somewhat healthful,  which is up from 49 percent in 2009.

She was 63.

Barnes took a job in logistics with Wilson Sporting Goods in the 1970s when it was owned by PepsiCo. She moved up swiftly within Wilson and eventually got noticed by the parent firm, joining the Frito-Lay division as marketing vice president in 1981. Just as quickly, she advanced within PepsiCo, eventually becoming president/CEO of Pepsi-Cola North America in 1996. Then, a year later, she walked away to spend more time with her family.

In 2004, with her three children in high school, Barnes returned to work as COO of Sara Lee. Seven months later she was named CEO, and shortly thereafter she added the title of chairman.

Barnes presided over a tumultuous period at what had become a disparate conglomerate. She sold off businesses such as Kiwi shoe polish and Hanes underwear to refocus Sara Lee on food.

With the rebuilding of the company not quite complete, she suffered her first stroke in May of 2010. A few months later, in the midst of a slow recovery, she resigned from the company.

In 2012, Sara Lee split into two companies, one primarily North American (and heavily into deli meats) and one European (and primarily into coffee). Eventually, the meat business renamed itself Hillshire Brands, which in 2014 was bought by Tyson Foods.

During her time in the business world, Barnes landed on many ""most powerful"" lists (including our own) and was heralded for her 1996 decision to quit to raise her children.","F&B"
