But rather than go after its use in diabetes, which many have tried and failed to do, the Israel-based upstart is aiming for specific indications to treat babies with intestinal malabsorption.

Its oral formulation of insulin aims to treat diseases locally, rather than systemically like other failed efforts. The reconstituted powder is administered into the gut via catheter where the oral insulin binds to insulin receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. This is intended to stimulate the intestinal villi and microvilli thereby helping to rehabilitate the bowel.

Nutrinia has nabbed a $30 million Series D that s already slated for a pair of pivotal trials to support registration in two separate gut maturation and adaptation indications: intestinal malabsorption in preterm newborns and Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) in infants. There are no approved treatments for either indication.

 We are beginning two trials in the US and Europe that will provide robust data as to the safety and efficacy of our proprietary oral formulation of insulin, and if successful, provide a direct path to registration,  said Nutrinia CEO Miki Olshansky in a statement.  These are orphan indications that affect fragile populations with high levels of unmet medical need. 

TPG Biotech led the financing with participation from H.I.G. BioHealth Partners and WuXi Healthcare Ventures, as well as from existing investors including OrbiMed and Pontifax.

 The biological rationale for Nutrinia s product is strong and the company s preclinical data and outcomes of multiple previous clinical trials are compelling,  said TPG Managing Director Eran Nadav.  We believe that neonatology, and specifically the NICU, are areas that deserve particular therapeutic development focus, and we are pleased to support Nutrinia s efforts. 

Nadav and Aaron Davidson of H.IG. are joining the board as part of the financing.

Founded in 2003, Nutrinia has now raised a total of about $43 million, according to SEC filings. It last had financing in December 2014 with a $12 million Series C round.

The two pre-dosing arms are giving NHL patients either rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody sold by Roche ($RHHBY) as Mabthera, or lilotomab before starting them on the experimental treatment being tested. That treatment is Nordic Nanovector s Betalutin, an anti-CD37 antibody-radionuclide conjugate. By pre-dosing, Nordic Nanovector thinks it can ratchet up Belatin levels without running into the safety issues that blighted an earlier version of the study.

 These arms are designed to investigate if different pre-dosing regimens will allow the use of higher doses of Betalutin to potentially achieve even better efficacy,  Nordic Nanovector CEO Luigi Costa said in a statement.

Once Nordic Nanovector has data from the first three patients in each of the pre-dosing arms, it will decide whether to increase the dose of Betalutin to 17.5 MBq/kg or 20 MBq/kg. The dose-finding trial started out at 10 MBq/kg. Nordic Nanovector has been up to 20 MBq/kg in the past, although some patients who received that dose required platelet transfusions.

That experience also taught Nordic Nanovector that 15 MBq/kg doses can cause transient, reversible thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, a lesson that prompted it to make pre-dosing an integral part of the study.

 The role of pre-dosing is to potentially ensure better control of hematological side effects and more specific tumour targeting with Betalutin,  Costa said.

Data presented earlier this year by Nordic Nanovector at 21st Congress of the European Hematology Association lend credence to this hypothesis. The data, which were taken from the ongoing Phase I/II trial, suggest pre-dosing with lilotomab can boost the proportion of patients who respond to treatment.

Nordic Nanovector is now heading toward the day on which it will learn whether the pre-dosing works as it hopes. Assuming the company can emerge from the dose-finding stage of the trial with a regimen that looks safe and effective, it plans to advance into Phase II in the second half of next year.

Its researchers published a paper earlier this month in Molecular Cell that detailed DNA repair profiles after cuts at 223 different sites in the human genome.

The scientists found that after cleavage via Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease enzyme, the cells repaired themselves in  highly reproducible patterns  that were  consistent across experimental replicates, cell lines, and reagent delivery methods. 

They found that repair outcomes are determined by the target site sequence, rather than genomic context. Researchers expect that these non-random outcomes could be reproduced systematically to produce a gene knockout or the restoration of a disease-causing allele.

 This discovery represents a fundamental advance in the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Through careful measurement of the outcomes of the DNA repair machinery, we can understand the specific patterns of editing that occur within a cell population with a high degree of certainty,  Caribou CSO Andrew May said in a statement.

He continued,  Our world class scientific team continues to make significant contributions to develop the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. 

The research is expected to enable scientists to use standard cell lines in the expectation that those results can be applied to more challenging, related cell types--including in human primary cells, which are derived directly from living tissue.

The Berkeley, CA-based startup is based on research from the Doudna Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. It aims to offer tools and tech not only for drug development, but also for agricultural and industrial biotech as well as biological research.

Caribou just raised a $30 million Series B financing in May from investors including Anterra Capital, Heritage Group, Maverick Capital Ventures, Pontifax AgTech,  F-Prime Capital Partners, Novartis ($NVS), Mission Bay Capital and 5 Prime Ventures.

But those plans have been pushed back as its lead candidate Andexxa, developed to reverse anticoagulation for Factor Xa inhibitors, has received a complete response letter from the FDA.

The company said on a conference call that it could resubmit Andexxa to the FDA before year-end. Portola shares were down about one-third, pushing it to a market cap of about $1.1 billion.

The agency asked for Portola to offer additional information, primarily related to manufacturing. It also asked for more data to support the inclusion of edoxaban and enoxaparin in the label; these are specific Factor Xa inhibitors, with the others named in its planned indication being apixaban and rivaroxaban.

Two Phase III trials evaluated Andexxa s reversal of the anticoagulants rivaroxaban and apixaban in older healthy volunteers, with the data published in The New England Journal of Medicine last November.

The FDA also said it needs to review clinical amendments that Portola recently submitted on its post-marketing commitments, the company said.

Portola hopes Andexxa will become the first universal antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors.

 Because Andexxa addresses an urgent unmet medical need, we and the FDA are committed to resolving the outstanding questions and determining appropriate next steps,  said the company s CEO Bill Lis in a statement.  Portola s goal is to define the most expedient path to approval so we can meet the needs of these patients who have no alternative. 

Andexxa has both an orphan drug and a breakthrough therapy designations from the FDA.

Up next, Portola has betrixaban, which is an oral, once-daily Factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulant. It s in Phase III testing to treat venous thromboembolism in acute medically ill patients. Betrixaban has fast track designation from the FDA and Portola hopes to launch it next year--despite the fact that it failed in pivotal testing.

The drug, Keyzilen (AM-101), could not best a dummy treatment in creating statistically significant changes in tinnitus loudness and tinnitus burden compared to placebo.

The Swiss biotech was looking to the future, reminding investors that results from a second Phase III trial, TACTT3, are due out this year--with the company hoping for better data. The biotech wants Keyzilen to become the first drug to gain approval for treating acute inner ear tinnitus, but this failure will be a major setback for the company.

The treatment contains esketamine hydrochloride, an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, made in the form of a biocompatible and biodegradable gel.

It is given in one treatment cycle, comprising three intratympanic injections over three to 5 days into the middle ear. From there the drug diffuses through the so-called round window membrane into the cochlea.

 We are disappointed that our TACTT2 trial did not reach its co-primary efficacy endpoints. The assessment of the trial data is ongoing and we intend to discuss outcomes and our plans for a path forward with regulatory agencies prior to the readout from the TACTT3 trial,  said Thomas Meyer, founder, chairman and CEO of Auris Medical.

 We would like to sincerely thank all patients, investigators and study site staff participating in TACTT2 for their dedicated contribution to the trial. Acute inner ear tinnitus represents an important unmet medical need and we remain committed to achieving our mission of providing tinnitus patients with effective and safe therapeutic options. 

TACTT3, which is being conducted in Europe, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled test in acute and post-acute inner ear tinnitus, following traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media.

The trial has enrolled more than 300 patients during the acute tinnitus stage and around 330 patients during the post-acute tinnitus stage. The mark of its success will be if it can produce a change in tinnitus loudness from baseline to day 84.

Analysts at Leerink were downbeat about the news.  These top-line results are disappointing and we are now compelled to anxiously wait for results from the Phase III TACTT3 EU study in 4Q16 as well as the full TACTT2 dataset analysis later this year. Our price target is under review,  the firm said in a note to clients.

It added:  Ultimately it remains to be seen how the FDA/EMA would consider Keyzilen if TACTT3 is successful in light of today's negative TACTT2 results, as we expect that two successful pivotal trials are necessary for approval. 

The company saw its shares down by more than 65% pre-market this morning on the news, with a market cap as of yesterday at just $186 million. It finished the day up 40% yesterday, before the data were released.

The latest step forward is the filing of an sBLA with FDA, an event that, if the regulator responds as quickly as in the past, could lead to the partners winning approval before the end of the year.

J&J has asked the FDA to handle Darzalex as a priority review, a status it could be eligible for under the terms of its breakthrough therapy designation. If the FDA accepts the request, it will process the sBLA within 6 months of now, setting J&J and Genmab up to receive a decision by mid-February. History suggests a decision could arrive well before then, though. When J&J sought approval in heavily pretreated or double refractory multiple myeloma patients late last year, the FDA made its decision in two months.

Approval of the sBLA would clear J&J to market Darzalex toward a larger proportion of multiple myeloma patients. The current approval makes Darzalex a near last resort option for patients who have already tried multiple other drugs. That could change soon. The sBLA positions Darzalex, a CD38 monoclonal antibody, to be used in combination with Celgene s ($CELG) Revlimid or Takeda s Velcade in multiple myeloma patients who have been through one other line of treatment.

The data in support of the use of the combinations in these patients are compelling. J&J and Genmab unveiled the results at cancer conferences earlier this year, at which time the Danish drugmaker s stock spiraled upward in anticipation of the paydays the data would lead to. Another one of those paydays arrived with the sBLA filing, an event that triggered a $15 million ( 13 million) milestone payment to Genmab.

As well as data from the Phase III Revlimid and Velcade combination trials, J&J included results from a Phase I study in the sBLA. The Phase I trial gave Darzalex in combination with Celgene s Pomalyst, an immunomodulator. Data from the trial, which were presented late last year, have been somewhat overshadowed by the subsequent release of the Phase III results. But the potential of the combination has caught the attention of some physicians.

Speaking to OncLive, Dr. Sagar Lonial, an Emory University School of Medicine professor who has been involved in trialling Darzalex, said:  The data ... was really pretty striking. What I think it really does is speak to the concept of non-cross-reactive drugs working synergistically. 

Given in isolation to refractory multiple myeloma patients, Darzalex and Pomalyst achieve response rates of approximately 30%. The Phase Ib combination trial achieved a response rate of approximately 70%, a fact that Lonial sees as showing the drugs complement each other.

 It really speaks to synergy between an antibody and an immunomodulatory agent ... that seems to not only directly target myeloma, but enhance [the] immune system's ability to make [Darzalex] a better drug,  he said.

Let s go back to the beginning: Biochemist Dr. Jennifer Doudna, from the University of California, Berkeley, submitted her patent application for the core CRISPR technology back in May 2012 after creating the tech along with Emmanuelle Charpentier.

But then biologist Feng Zhang from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT submitted a similar patent application in 2013--but he requested a fast-track process and received the official patent in April 2014. Zhang has since been awarded additional patents on the technology.

The two both claim to have invented the tech, leading to a legal  interference  claim in January of this year between the two scientists  patent apps to settle just who is right.

This battle has been simmering in 2016 but boiled over this week when an email from Shuailiang Lin, a junior scientist formerly at the Broad Institute, to Doudna has come to light disputing MIT-Harvard institution s claims to CRISPR, and accusing the org of misleading the patent office.

The email was originally sent in February of last year, but has now been made public by the U.S. Patent Office. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been invested into this tech and the companies working in it, including Zhang s Editas ($EDIT), as well as CRISPR Therapeutics, Caribou Biosciences, Intellia ($NTLA) and Novartis ($NVS).

Lin s account is made the more interesting given that he worked at Zhang s lab at the time the patents were filed, and because he is listed as an inventor on Broad s earliest patent filing, from December 2012, and says in the email that he was working in late 2011 on CRISPR on his own in Zhang s lab.

He went back to China in 2012, but when Doudna s paper on the tech was published that year, Lin alleges that Zhang and others  quickly jumped to the project without letting me know.  He says he has lists of files and documents that prove the failures coming out of his CRISPR work in those days and can show them to  whoever is interested in the truth. 

The email was in fact designed as a job application to Doudna, where he says:  I think revolutionary technology like this should not be mis-patented. We did not work it out [how to use CRISPR effectively] before seeing your paper.  Lin now works as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, but is not commenting on the email.

In a statement Lee McGuire, chief communications officer at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said that Lin was just a  rotation student, who visited the Broad for a brief period from a Peking University/Tsinghua University joint program.  They confirmed that he worked for Feng Zhang at the Broad on CRISPR projects from October 2011 to June 2012.

But he added that Lin could not be offered a position to return to the Broad Institute.

 Although the rotation student s email makes several claims, the Opposition Document [in the ongoing patent case which is using the email] does not include any evidence to support them,  the statement says.

McGuire goes to claim that:  Abundant evidence already shows that the student s claims are false. Examples include email exchanges between the student and Zhang:

Why is this important? Well, because the battle is predominately around money: Whoever owns the rights owns much of the money that will come out of meds approved in the future using this tech. It s all still at a preclinical stage, but trials could start in the U.S. and China this year in cancer targets, with more slated to start from 2017 as a slew of different companies, academic centers and organizations seek to be the first to get into the clinic and eventually gain approval.

Each group is using CRISPR in slightly different ways, but the fundamental aspect sees the tech used to edit genes by leveraging an RNA guide molecule to enter in specific cells.

A protein called Cas9 then attaches to the DNA and essentially cuts it, all of which either gets rid of, completely removes or replaces a gene with a better strand of DNA. It could be used in a host of diseases, but oncology appears to be the favored early target.

This is according to people  familiar with the matter  talking once again to the newswire service, and comes after the U.S. giant gained a major boost in its attempt to dominate the non-small cell lung cancer I/O market after rival Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY) this month flubbed a key Phase III test.

Merck can now be added to the ever-growing list of suitors that includes Sanofi ($SNY)--which has publicly made its interest known--as well as Celgene ($CELG), Gilead ($GILD) and Pfizer ($PFE), who are not commenting on the rumors.

Sanofi has in fact already been knocked back twice by Medivation for its lowball offers. The French Big Pharma, in need of a reinvigorated oncology pipeline after backing away from the area in the past two years, has been allowed to look at Medivation s books.

It had been going hostile, but recently dropped its bid to oust its board. Medivation has consistently sought a higher price with its CEO David Hung seemingly ready to play the long game to get the best possible price, and allow the suitors to fall over themselves to bring the largest wad of cash to the table.

Merck has a potential $5 billion at peak blockbuster on its hands in the form of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), but may also be seeking to shore up its own cancer pipeline with Medivation s R&D offerings.

The Californian biotech co-markets the blockbuster prostate cancer med Xtandi with Japanese pharma Astellas, owning rights to the blockbuster sales in the U.S. from the drug, but also has a respected store of cancer candidates in its labs.

Key among these is the PARP inhibitor talazoparib, which has posted strong late-stage data over the past year and was recently boosted by impressive data coming out of biotech Tesaro ($TSRO) and its experimental PARP niraparib after its ovarian cancer patients lived longer.

Medivation contends that its PARP is more effective, and could be the market leader--something it is pushing hard given how this could help up its own sale price.

Medivation saw its shares up 1.5% after hours last night when Reuters broke the news, with a market cap of just over $11 billion.

The new data, published this week in JAMA, showed that 2,463 female osteoporosis patients in the ACTIVE Phase III trial, when treated with a daily injection of abaloparatide for 18 months, had a significantly greater reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures when compared to placebo.

It was a little less strong on nonvertebral fractures when compared to placebo, however, with a P value of 0.049--meaning it just squeaked into significance. But it still did manage to hit its trial targets.

Radius is currently set for an EU approval for its candidate by the end of the year, with the med also under FDA review, with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017.

The Cambridge, MA-based biotech is hoping to beat out competition from Amgen ($AMGN) and its partner UCB for their experimental bone drug romosozumab (a.k.a. romo).

Back in March, romo--an antibody designed to block the protein sclerostin--achieved its Phase III BRIDGE study primary endpoint of increasing bone mineral density of lumbar spine at 12 months, when compared with placebo.

It also hit its secondary endpoints of bone mineral density increase of femoral neck and total hip at 12 months over placebo, and BMD increase of lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip at 6 months over placebo.

This came a month after the company posted generally positive results for the med in its FRAME study for women--although analysts were quick to note that the drug didn't perform as well as abaloparatide.

Both are looking to capture market share from Eli Lilly's ($LLY) rival blockbuster Forteo (teriparatide).

 The landmark ACTIVE trial results are important and further validate abaloparatide s potential to consistently, substantially and rapidly reduce both new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,  said Dr. Paul Miller, medical director at the Colorado Center for Bone Research and lead author of the paper.

 Approximately two million osteoporotic fractures occur annually in the U.S., which create physical and psychological burdens for affected women by diminishing their independence and quality of life. There is a great unmet medical need for therapies which could provide more consistent potent and early benefits to patients. 

Abaloparatide works as a synthetic peptide that engages the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1 receptor) and designed to help with bone building activity.

Radius  shares were up this morning on this news by around 1% at 10am EDT, but then quickly dropped into the red. The company currently has a market cap of around $2.33 billion.

The early-stage biotech is currently working on modulating the molecular targets LSD1 and NPM1, which are implicated in the progression of both leukemia and lymphoma.

 Becoming a public company is a key element of our growth strategy, and the completion of this reverse merger is a significant accomplishment for Rasna Therapeutics,  said James Tripp, acting CEO of Rasna.

 We believe that this breakthrough program may have significant benefits across all forms of leukemia. Our NPM1 program targets the sub-set of acute myeloid leukemia patients with the NPM1 mutation and may also benefit the general AML population. We are aiming to have a lead candidate identified by 2017. 

Rasna was formed in 2013 by biotech entrepreneur Gabriele Cerrone together with Dr. Roberto Pellicciari, a medicinal chemist and the scientific founder of Intercept Pharmaceuticals ($ICPT), and Dr. Brunangelo Falini, a physician and hematologist.","Pharmaceuticals"

But rather than go after its use in diabetes, which many have tried and failed to do, the Israel-based upstart is aiming for specific indications to treat babies with intestinal malabsorption.

Its oral formulation of insulin aims to treat diseases locally, rather than systemically like other failed efforts. The reconstituted powder is administered into the gut via catheter where the oral insulin binds to insulin receptors in the gastrointestinal tract. This is intended to stimulate the intestinal villi and microvilli thereby helping to rehabilitate the bowel.

Nutrinia has nabbed a $30 million Series D that s already slated for a pair of pivotal trials to support registration in two separate gut maturation and adaptation indications: intestinal malabsorption in preterm newborns and Short Bowel Syndrome (SBS) in infants. There are no approved treatments for either indication.

 We are beginning two trials in the US and Europe that will provide robust data as to the safety and efficacy of our proprietary oral formulation of insulin, and if successful, provide a direct path to registration,  said Nutrinia CEO Miki Olshansky in a statement.  These are orphan indications that affect fragile populations with high levels of unmet medical need. 

TPG Biotech led the financing with participation from H.I.G. BioHealth Partners and WuXi Healthcare Ventures, as well as from existing investors including OrbiMed and Pontifax.

 The biological rationale for Nutrinia s product is strong and the company s preclinical data and outcomes of multiple previous clinical trials are compelling,  said TPG Managing Director Eran Nadav.  We believe that neonatology, and specifically the NICU, are areas that deserve particular therapeutic development focus, and we are pleased to support Nutrinia s efforts. 

Nadav and Aaron Davidson of H.IG. are joining the board as part of the financing.

Founded in 2003, Nutrinia has now raised a total of about $43 million, according to SEC filings. It last had financing in December 2014 with a $12 million Series C round.

The two pre-dosing arms are giving NHL patients either rituximab, a CD20 monoclonal antibody sold by Roche ($RHHBY) as Mabthera, or lilotomab before starting them on the experimental treatment being tested. That treatment is Nordic Nanovector s Betalutin, an anti-CD37 antibody-radionuclide conjugate. By pre-dosing, Nordic Nanovector thinks it can ratchet up Belatin levels without running into the safety issues that blighted an earlier version of the study.

 These arms are designed to investigate if different pre-dosing regimens will allow the use of higher doses of Betalutin to potentially achieve even better efficacy,  Nordic Nanovector CEO Luigi Costa said in a statement.

Once Nordic Nanovector has data from the first three patients in each of the pre-dosing arms, it will decide whether to increase the dose of Betalutin to 17.5 MBq/kg or 20 MBq/kg. The dose-finding trial started out at 10 MBq/kg. Nordic Nanovector has been up to 20 MBq/kg in the past, although some patients who received that dose required platelet transfusions.

That experience also taught Nordic Nanovector that 15 MBq/kg doses can cause transient, reversible thrombocytopenia and neutropenia, a lesson that prompted it to make pre-dosing an integral part of the study.

 The role of pre-dosing is to potentially ensure better control of hematological side effects and more specific tumour targeting with Betalutin,  Costa said.

Data presented earlier this year by Nordic Nanovector at 21st Congress of the European Hematology Association lend credence to this hypothesis. The data, which were taken from the ongoing Phase I/II trial, suggest pre-dosing with lilotomab can boost the proportion of patients who respond to treatment.

Nordic Nanovector is now heading toward the day on which it will learn whether the pre-dosing works as it hopes. Assuming the company can emerge from the dose-finding stage of the trial with a regimen that looks safe and effective, it plans to advance into Phase II in the second half of next year.

Its researchers published a paper earlier this month in Molecular Cell that detailed DNA repair profiles after cuts at 223 different sites in the human genome.

The scientists found that after cleavage via Cas9, an RNA-guided DNA endonuclease enzyme, the cells repaired themselves in  highly reproducible patterns  that were  consistent across experimental replicates, cell lines, and reagent delivery methods. 

They found that repair outcomes are determined by the target site sequence, rather than genomic context. Researchers expect that these non-random outcomes could be reproduced systematically to produce a gene knockout or the restoration of a disease-causing allele.

 This discovery represents a fundamental advance in the development of CRISPR-Cas9 technology. Through careful measurement of the outcomes of the DNA repair machinery, we can understand the specific patterns of editing that occur within a cell population with a high degree of certainty,  Caribou CSO Andrew May said in a statement.

He continued,  Our world class scientific team continues to make significant contributions to develop the potential of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. 

The research is expected to enable scientists to use standard cell lines in the expectation that those results can be applied to more challenging, related cell types--including in human primary cells, which are derived directly from living tissue.

The Berkeley, CA-based startup is based on research from the Doudna Laboratory at the University of California at Berkeley. It aims to offer tools and tech not only for drug development, but also for agricultural and industrial biotech as well as biological research.

Caribou just raised a $30 million Series B financing in May from investors including Anterra Capital, Heritage Group, Maverick Capital Ventures, Pontifax AgTech,  F-Prime Capital Partners, Novartis ($NVS), Mission Bay Capital and 5 Prime Ventures.

But those plans have been pushed back as its lead candidate Andexxa, developed to reverse anticoagulation for Factor Xa inhibitors, has received a complete response letter from the FDA.

The company said on a conference call that it could resubmit Andexxa to the FDA before year-end. Portola shares were down about one-third, pushing it to a market cap of about $1.1 billion.

The agency asked for Portola to offer additional information, primarily related to manufacturing. It also asked for more data to support the inclusion of edoxaban and enoxaparin in the label; these are specific Factor Xa inhibitors, with the others named in its planned indication being apixaban and rivaroxaban.

Two Phase III trials evaluated Andexxa s reversal of the anticoagulants rivaroxaban and apixaban in older healthy volunteers, with the data published in The New England Journal of Medicine last November.

The FDA also said it needs to review clinical amendments that Portola recently submitted on its post-marketing commitments, the company said.

Portola hopes Andexxa will become the first universal antidote for Factor Xa inhibitors.

 Because Andexxa addresses an urgent unmet medical need, we and the FDA are committed to resolving the outstanding questions and determining appropriate next steps,  said the company s CEO Bill Lis in a statement.  Portola s goal is to define the most expedient path to approval so we can meet the needs of these patients who have no alternative. 

Andexxa has both an orphan drug and a breakthrough therapy designations from the FDA.

Up next, Portola has betrixaban, which is an oral, once-daily Factor Xa inhibitor anticoagulant. It s in Phase III testing to treat venous thromboembolism in acute medically ill patients. Betrixaban has fast track designation from the FDA and Portola hopes to launch it next year--despite the fact that it failed in pivotal testing.

The drug, Keyzilen (AM-101), could not best a dummy treatment in creating statistically significant changes in tinnitus loudness and tinnitus burden compared to placebo.

The Swiss biotech was looking to the future, reminding investors that results from a second Phase III trial, TACTT3, are due out this year--with the company hoping for better data. The biotech wants Keyzilen to become the first drug to gain approval for treating acute inner ear tinnitus, but this failure will be a major setback for the company.

The treatment contains esketamine hydrochloride, an N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, made in the form of a biocompatible and biodegradable gel.

It is given in one treatment cycle, comprising three intratympanic injections over three to 5 days into the middle ear. From there the drug diffuses through the so-called round window membrane into the cochlea.

 We are disappointed that our TACTT2 trial did not reach its co-primary efficacy endpoints. The assessment of the trial data is ongoing and we intend to discuss outcomes and our plans for a path forward with regulatory agencies prior to the readout from the TACTT3 trial,  said Thomas Meyer, founder, chairman and CEO of Auris Medical.

 We would like to sincerely thank all patients, investigators and study site staff participating in TACTT2 for their dedicated contribution to the trial. Acute inner ear tinnitus represents an important unmet medical need and we remain committed to achieving our mission of providing tinnitus patients with effective and safe therapeutic options. 

TACTT3, which is being conducted in Europe, is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled test in acute and post-acute inner ear tinnitus, following traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media.

The trial has enrolled more than 300 patients during the acute tinnitus stage and around 330 patients during the post-acute tinnitus stage. The mark of its success will be if it can produce a change in tinnitus loudness from baseline to day 84.

Analysts at Leerink were downbeat about the news.  These top-line results are disappointing and we are now compelled to anxiously wait for results from the Phase III TACTT3 EU study in 4Q16 as well as the full TACTT2 dataset analysis later this year. Our price target is under review,  the firm said in a note to clients.

It added:  Ultimately it remains to be seen how the FDA/EMA would consider Keyzilen if TACTT3 is successful in light of today's negative TACTT2 results, as we expect that two successful pivotal trials are necessary for approval. 

The company saw its shares down by more than 65% pre-market this morning on the news, with a market cap as of yesterday at just $186 million. It finished the day up 40% yesterday, before the data were released.

The latest step forward is the filing of an sBLA with FDA, an event that, if the regulator responds as quickly as in the past, could lead to the partners winning approval before the end of the year.

J&J has asked the FDA to handle Darzalex as a priority review, a status it could be eligible for under the terms of its breakthrough therapy designation. If the FDA accepts the request, it will process the sBLA within 6 months of now, setting J&J and Genmab up to receive a decision by mid-February. History suggests a decision could arrive well before then, though. When J&J sought approval in heavily pretreated or double refractory multiple myeloma patients late last year, the FDA made its decision in two months.

Approval of the sBLA would clear J&J to market Darzalex toward a larger proportion of multiple myeloma patients. The current approval makes Darzalex a near last resort option for patients who have already tried multiple other drugs. That could change soon. The sBLA positions Darzalex, a CD38 monoclonal antibody, to be used in combination with Celgene s ($CELG) Revlimid or Takeda s Velcade in multiple myeloma patients who have been through one other line of treatment.

The data in support of the use of the combinations in these patients are compelling. J&J and Genmab unveiled the results at cancer conferences earlier this year, at which time the Danish drugmaker s stock spiraled upward in anticipation of the paydays the data would lead to. Another one of those paydays arrived with the sBLA filing, an event that triggered a $15 million ( 13 million) milestone payment to Genmab.

As well as data from the Phase III Revlimid and Velcade combination trials, J&J included results from a Phase I study in the sBLA. The Phase I trial gave Darzalex in combination with Celgene s Pomalyst, an immunomodulator. Data from the trial, which were presented late last year, have been somewhat overshadowed by the subsequent release of the Phase III results. But the potential of the combination has caught the attention of some physicians.

Speaking to OncLive, Dr. Sagar Lonial, an Emory University School of Medicine professor who has been involved in trialling Darzalex, said:  The data ... was really pretty striking. What I think it really does is speak to the concept of non-cross-reactive drugs working synergistically. 

Given in isolation to refractory multiple myeloma patients, Darzalex and Pomalyst achieve response rates of approximately 30%. The Phase Ib combination trial achieved a response rate of approximately 70%, a fact that Lonial sees as showing the drugs complement each other.

 It really speaks to synergy between an antibody and an immunomodulatory agent ... that seems to not only directly target myeloma, but enhance [the] immune system's ability to make [Darzalex] a better drug,  he said.

Let s go back to the beginning: Biochemist Dr. Jennifer Doudna, from the University of California, Berkeley, submitted her patent application for the core CRISPR technology back in May 2012 after creating the tech along with Emmanuelle Charpentier.

But then biologist Feng Zhang from the Broad Institute of Harvard and MIT submitted a similar patent application in 2013--but he requested a fast-track process and received the official patent in April 2014. Zhang has since been awarded additional patents on the technology.

The two both claim to have invented the tech, leading to a legal  interference  claim in January of this year between the two scientists  patent apps to settle just who is right.

This battle has been simmering in 2016 but boiled over this week when an email from Shuailiang Lin, a junior scientist formerly at the Broad Institute, to Doudna has come to light disputing MIT-Harvard institution s claims to CRISPR, and accusing the org of misleading the patent office.

The email was originally sent in February of last year, but has now been made public by the U.S. Patent Office. Hundreds of millions of dollars have already been invested into this tech and the companies working in it, including Zhang s Editas ($EDIT), as well as CRISPR Therapeutics, Caribou Biosciences, Intellia ($NTLA) and Novartis ($NVS).

Lin s account is made the more interesting given that he worked at Zhang s lab at the time the patents were filed, and because he is listed as an inventor on Broad s earliest patent filing, from December 2012, and says in the email that he was working in late 2011 on CRISPR on his own in Zhang s lab.

He went back to China in 2012, but when Doudna s paper on the tech was published that year, Lin alleges that Zhang and others  quickly jumped to the project without letting me know.  He says he has lists of files and documents that prove the failures coming out of his CRISPR work in those days and can show them to  whoever is interested in the truth. 

The email was in fact designed as a job application to Doudna, where he says:  I think revolutionary technology like this should not be mis-patented. We did not work it out [how to use CRISPR effectively] before seeing your paper.  Lin now works as a postdoctoral researcher at the University of California, San Francisco, but is not commenting on the email.

In a statement Lee McGuire, chief communications officer at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, said that Lin was just a  rotation student, who visited the Broad for a brief period from a Peking University/Tsinghua University joint program.  They confirmed that he worked for Feng Zhang at the Broad on CRISPR projects from October 2011 to June 2012.

But he added that Lin could not be offered a position to return to the Broad Institute.

 Although the rotation student s email makes several claims, the Opposition Document [in the ongoing patent case which is using the email] does not include any evidence to support them,  the statement says.

McGuire goes to claim that:  Abundant evidence already shows that the student s claims are false. Examples include email exchanges between the student and Zhang:

Why is this important? Well, because the battle is predominately around money: Whoever owns the rights owns much of the money that will come out of meds approved in the future using this tech. It s all still at a preclinical stage, but trials could start in the U.S. and China this year in cancer targets, with more slated to start from 2017 as a slew of different companies, academic centers and organizations seek to be the first to get into the clinic and eventually gain approval.

Each group is using CRISPR in slightly different ways, but the fundamental aspect sees the tech used to edit genes by leveraging an RNA guide molecule to enter in specific cells.

A protein called Cas9 then attaches to the DNA and essentially cuts it, all of which either gets rid of, completely removes or replaces a gene with a better strand of DNA. It could be used in a host of diseases, but oncology appears to be the favored early target.

This is according to people  familiar with the matter  talking once again to the newswire service, and comes after the U.S. giant gained a major boost in its attempt to dominate the non-small cell lung cancer I/O market after rival Bristol-Myers Squibb ($BMY) this month flubbed a key Phase III test.

Merck can now be added to the ever-growing list of suitors that includes Sanofi ($SNY)--which has publicly made its interest known--as well as Celgene ($CELG), Gilead ($GILD) and Pfizer ($PFE), who are not commenting on the rumors.

Sanofi has in fact already been knocked back twice by Medivation for its lowball offers. The French Big Pharma, in need of a reinvigorated oncology pipeline after backing away from the area in the past two years, has been allowed to look at Medivation s books.

It had been going hostile, but recently dropped its bid to oust its board. Medivation has consistently sought a higher price with its CEO David Hung seemingly ready to play the long game to get the best possible price, and allow the suitors to fall over themselves to bring the largest wad of cash to the table.

Merck has a potential $5 billion at peak blockbuster on its hands in the form of PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab), but may also be seeking to shore up its own cancer pipeline with Medivation s R&D offerings.

The Californian biotech co-markets the blockbuster prostate cancer med Xtandi with Japanese pharma Astellas, owning rights to the blockbuster sales in the U.S. from the drug, but also has a respected store of cancer candidates in its labs.

Key among these is the PARP inhibitor talazoparib, which has posted strong late-stage data over the past year and was recently boosted by impressive data coming out of biotech Tesaro ($TSRO) and its experimental PARP niraparib after its ovarian cancer patients lived longer.

Medivation contends that its PARP is more effective, and could be the market leader--something it is pushing hard given how this could help up its own sale price.

Medivation saw its shares up 1.5% after hours last night when Reuters broke the news, with a market cap of just over $11 billion.

The new data, published this week in JAMA, showed that 2,463 female osteoporosis patients in the ACTIVE Phase III trial, when treated with a daily injection of abaloparatide for 18 months, had a significantly greater reduction in the incidence of new vertebral fractures when compared to placebo.

It was a little less strong on nonvertebral fractures when compared to placebo, however, with a P value of 0.049--meaning it just squeaked into significance. But it still did manage to hit its trial targets.

Radius is currently set for an EU approval for its candidate by the end of the year, with the med also under FDA review, with a PDUFA date of March 30, 2017.

The Cambridge, MA-based biotech is hoping to beat out competition from Amgen ($AMGN) and its partner UCB for their experimental bone drug romosozumab (a.k.a. romo).

Back in March, romo--an antibody designed to block the protein sclerostin--achieved its Phase III BRIDGE study primary endpoint of increasing bone mineral density of lumbar spine at 12 months, when compared with placebo.

It also hit its secondary endpoints of bone mineral density increase of femoral neck and total hip at 12 months over placebo, and BMD increase of lumbar spine, femoral neck, and total hip at 6 months over placebo.

This came a month after the company posted generally positive results for the med in its FRAME study for women--although analysts were quick to note that the drug didn't perform as well as abaloparatide.

Both are looking to capture market share from Eli Lilly's ($LLY) rival blockbuster Forteo (teriparatide).

 The landmark ACTIVE trial results are important and further validate abaloparatide s potential to consistently, substantially and rapidly reduce both new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis,  said Dr. Paul Miller, medical director at the Colorado Center for Bone Research and lead author of the paper.

 Approximately two million osteoporotic fractures occur annually in the U.S., which create physical and psychological burdens for affected women by diminishing their independence and quality of life. There is a great unmet medical need for therapies which could provide more consistent potent and early benefits to patients. 

Abaloparatide works as a synthetic peptide that engages the parathyroid hormone receptor (PTH1 receptor) and designed to help with bone building activity.

Radius  shares were up this morning on this news by around 1% at 10am EDT, but then quickly dropped into the red. The company currently has a market cap of around $2.33 billion.

The reverse merger, which more quickly propels the formerly private biotech into the public sphere, has been done through Active With Me--a Canadian company that offers online information on activity-based travel to travelers.

The two are strange bedfellows, given that U.K.-based Rasna Therapeutics works on cancer drugs, but the deal has now been finalized and allows the biotech to trade its shares publicly, with the combined company to be named Rasna Therapeutics.

The early-stage biotech is currently working on modulating the molecular targets LSD1 and NPM1, which are implicated in the progression of both leukemia and lymphoma.

 Becoming a public company is a key element of our growth strategy, and the completion of this reverse merger is a significant accomplishment for Rasna Therapeutics,  said James Tripp, acting CEO of Rasna.

 We believe that this breakthrough program may have significant benefits across all forms of leukemia. Our NPM1 program targets the sub-set of acute myeloid leukemia patients with the NPM1 mutation and may also benefit the general AML population. We are aiming to have a lead candidate identified by 2017. 

Rasna was formed in 2013 by biotech entrepreneur Gabriele Cerrone together with Dr. Roberto Pellicciari, a medicinal chemist and the scientific founder of Intercept Pharmaceuticals ($ICPT), and Dr. Brunangelo Falini, a physician and hematologist.","Pharmaceuticals"

Shares in the Reckitt Benckiser (LON:RB) spinout surged 15% after a Phase III trial of its opioid dependence drug met the primary endpoint and a key secondary outcome, setting the candidate up to win approval by the end of 2017.

Slough, U.K.-based Indivior is developing the drug, RBP-6000, to free people with opioid use disorder from the need to take medication every day to control their conditions. RBP-6000 is a slow-release injection of the well-established opioid addiction treatment buprenorphine. Indivior has designed the depot formulation to be administered every month, a schedule that could be beneficial to those who struggle to comply with daily regimens.

Such benefits are all for naught, though, if the drug fails to control addiction. The Phase III data go a long way toward dismissing this concern. The trial enrolled 489 subjects with moderate to severe opioid disorder who, while not currently in treatment, wanted medication to help manage their conditions. After an induction phase in which subjects took Suboxone, a sublingual film containing buprenorphine and naloxone, they were randomized to receive either low or high doses of RBP-6000 or placebo.

Indivior tracked the efficacy of RBP-6000 by testing urine samples for opioids and asking participants about their illicit opioid use. After 24 weeks of testing, Indivior found both treatment arms outperformed placebo against this combined urine sample, self-reported endpoint.

As well as hitting that primary endpoint, RBP-6000 succeeded against a key secondary outcome measure. That endpoint looked at the number of people whose urine tested negative for opioids at least 80% of the time. This secondary outcome, which also incorporated self-reporting, was met by both treatment arms. Indivior is content with the safety data, too, although 4.6% of subjects in the RBP-6000 arm dropped out, compared to 2% for the placebo.

The release sent shares in Indivior up 15% in London, bringing the stock s total gains since it listed at the end of 2014 up to 140% and its market cap to  2.45 billion ($3.2 billion). The latest gains are underpinned by a belief that Indivior is now closing in on approval of a drug that can make a dent on the opioid addiction crisis.

 We believe that RBP-6000 can potentially transform the treatment of opioid dependence, if approved, by possibly reducing patients  treatment administration days from 365 a year to 12,  Indivior CEO Shaun Thaxter said in a statement.  RBP-6000 was designed to offer physicians the potential for increased certainty of treatment adherence, and developed with the desire to help mitigate abuse, misuse and diversion of medication. 

Indivior has FDA fast-track designation for the drug, a status that it thinks can enable it to wrap up the data analysis, file and win approval by the end of 2017. That would represent a big boost to Indivior s chances of thriving as a standalone company. Currently, Indivior s business is built upon daily oral formulations of buprenorphine. Now, with schizophrenia drug RBP-7000 also edging toward a regulatory decision, Indivior could be on the cusp of broadening its portfolio.

The company, Xycrobe Therapeutics, has been at the incubator since 2014.

The partners plan to apply Xycrobe s tech, which includes a library of bacterial strains that have a symbiotic relationship living on human skin. The La Jolla, CA-based company has developed several strains of these commensal skin bacteria that could reduce skin inflammation, including in diseases including acne, psoriasis, dermatitis and eczema.

Interestingly, the deal is with J&J s Consumer business, rather than its drug development arm Janssen.

""The current paradigm for treating skin conditions, such as acne, completely disregards the importance of the commensal skin flora. Overuse of antibiotics have led to a higher prevalence of resistant strains of bacteria and along with that comes less efficacy for conventional treatments. So, we are attempting to change that paradigm,"" said Xycrobe founder and CEO Thomas Hitchcock in a statement.

He continued, ""We feel that the key to better treatment solutions for skin disease lies in understanding our body's interaction with the skin microbiome, and how we can leverage this information. 

Xycrobe expects to pursue programs related to various skin issues including hair loss and toenail fungus, but its initial focus is on these inflammatory skin diseases.

Johnson & Johnson has been actively pursuing microbiome-based treatments. It has created the Janssen Human Microbiome Institute (JHMI) specifically to pursue such research. It has research centers in Cambridge, MA and Beerse, Belgium.

The pharma has done some deals on the microbiome front including a pair that are both focused on inflammatory bowel disease one with Cambridge, MA-based Vedanta Biosciences and the other with South San Francisco, CA-based Second Genome.

The Vedanta deal, which dates from last year, was Janssen s first to in-license a microbiome therapeutic candidate.

It s for an indication of major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide; the prior designation is for treatment-resistant depression, which the pharma received in November 2013.

Esketamine could offer another option to treat depression, which is underserved and has seen scant innovation in decades. It s an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist--and an isomer of the generic anesthetic and notorious party drug ketamine. The intranasal formulation offers fast-acting benefits, unlike standard oral treatment approaches.

J&J has high expectations for esketamine, which it listed last year among the more than 10 late-stage products that it expects could become blockbusters with over $1 billion in sales. The candidate was the only neurology candidate in this list, all of which the pharma expects could be approved before 2020. Neuroscience is one of J&J s five core therapeutic areas.

 What we found was again spectacular results where patients who were refractory to most antidepressants when they go on esketamine within days, their improvement in mood is dramatic and somewhat unpredictable,  said William Hait, J&J s Janssen Global Head of Research & Development on a conference call in early May describing data on the candidate.  The duration of the effect is much longer than one might have predicted from the half-life of the drug. So very rapid improvement in mood, not the weeks and sometimes even months to take SSRI or tricyclic. So very rapid and long duration. 

Phase III data for the treatment-resistant depression indication is expected in late 2017. The Phase II data to support the breakthrough designation in major depressive disorder with imminent risk for suicide was reported in May at the Society of Biological Psychiatry conference.

Hait added,  The study was done in patients who come to the emergency room, they've attempted suicide or about to attempt and someone rescues them. They get admitted to the hospital for standard treatment plus or minus esketamine. And what we saw again, within days, a dramatic improvement in the mood of these patients and a decrease in suicide ideology. 

Ketamine is already used off-label to treat depression patients, a practice that s increasing according to a recent Leerink note based on interviews with a trio of depression physician specialists.

And J&J is not alone in targeting NMDA for depression. Allergan ($AGN) is also developing intravenous rapastinel, which is in Phase III and oral AGN-241660, which is in Phase II, both of which are NMDA modulators. Rapastinel also received breakthrough designation from the FDA in January.

The specialists interviewed by Leerink viewed rapastinel and esketamine as the most promising NMDA modulators to treat depression due to Phase II data showing a rapid onset of action and limited psychotomimetic side effects; the latter is an issue with off-label ketamine use.

The addition of a Brisbane, CA headquarters was sparked by the hire of experienced biotech exec John Donovan to head the company.

Donovan s last endeavor, viral disease play Alios BioPharma, was sold to Johnson & Johnson ($JNJ) for about $1.75 billion near the end of 2014. He founded that company and served as its CBO and CFO. Donovan remained with J&J through the end of 2015. He started out as a Wall Street banker, before transitioning to the corporate side with a job at InterMune prior to its acquisition by Roche ($RHHBY).

Tioma started out as Vasculox in 2006 and until now has survived on some small seed rounds. It plans to use its $86 million Series A to advance it lead candidate, an anti-CD47 immune checkpoint inhibitor, through advanced proof-of-concept clinical trials.

The financing attracted a trio of strategic players: It was co-led by RiverVest Venture Partners, Novo Ventures, Roche Venture Fund and GlaxoSmithKline s ($GSK) corporate venture arm S.R. One.

 We find CD47 to be an extremely interesting target in the evolving cancer immunotherapy landscape,  said Novo Ventures Partner Peter Moldt in a statement.  Tioma Therapeutics, with its portfolio of diverse, functionally heterogeneous antibodies, is well positioned to test the CD47 hypothesis in the clinic. 

Tioma aims to treat solid and hematologic cancers. The startup expects that its anti-CD47 antibody approach could have the potential to promote two different aspects of the immune system: the innate and the adaptive immune response. The innate response is an initial, non-specific defense mechanism that is activated by the chemical properties of an antigen, but the adaptive immune response is antigen-specific and, therefore, more complex.

The company counts William Frazier, a professor of Biochemistry, Molecular Biophysics, Cell Biology, and Biomedical Engineering at Washington University School of Medicine, amongst its scientific founders. He was key in the discovery that CD47 is a receptor for thrombospondin-1. Tioma will keep its St. Louis research labs.

The study will give Astex Pharmaceuticals  DNMT inhibitor in combination with chemotherapy.

In the first phase of the study, CRUK, working out of its clinical trial unit in Southampton, U.K., will give small doses of the DNMT inhibitor guadecitabine to up to 36 patients with advanced solid tumors. In doing so, CRUK expects to confirm the safety of the drug and identify the most effective dose, setting it up to advance into the second phase of the clinical trial. This second phase represents the critical stage for the program.

CRUK plans to enroll 20 patients with bladder cancer who are scheduled to have three or four cycles of chemotherapy before undergoing surgery. Some of the participants will be randomized to receive this standard-of-care treatment. Another cohort will receive the cycles of chemotherapy plus Astex s experimental DNMT inhibitor guadecitabine, also known as SGI-110. Preclinical research suggests the combination could be more effective than chemotherapy alone.

This line of thinking is underpinned by knowledge of the mechanism of action of guadecitabine and the process that causes bladder cancers to develop resistance to chemotherapy. As DNMTs facilitate epigenetic modifications that researchers have for decades linked to the development of resistance to chemotherapy, CRUK is hoping the inhibition of the process will result in tumors of patients in the guadecitabine arm remaining more susceptible to the standard-of-care treatment.

CRUK is running the trial as part of the Combinations Alliance, an initiative that brings the nonprofit together with the Experimental Cancer Medicine Centres Network and drug developers to see which treatments work well when given together. In this instance, the drug developer is Astex, a biotech run out of Cambridge, U.K. and Pleasanton, CA, that was bought out by Otsuka for $886 million ( 786 million) in 2013.

Astex has advanced guadecitabine furthest down the pipeline as a treatment for blood cancers--in April it teamed with Genentech for an anti-PD-L1 combination study in acute myeloid leukemia--but it has also explored its effect on solid tumors. Many of the solid tumor trials, like the CRUK study, are sponsored by third parties that want to assess the effect of guadecitabine in combination with other drugs in indications such as melanoma and colorectal cancer.

Other trials for VX-661, its lead pipeline drug, are still ongoing, but it has stopped its combo Phase III study in a small subpopulation of patients with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a mutation that results in minimal CFTR protein function (F508del het/min).

This comes after an independent Data Safety Monitoring Board, which said that the results it had seen did not warrant further tests. Vertex noted that there were not however any safety issues coming out of the study.

The company will push on with other studies for the two meds, though, and said that this week it had just finished enrollment for the study of VX-661 and Kalydeco in people with two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del homozygous).

Another trial, which will enroll people with one copy of the F508del mutation and one copy of a residual function mutation, should also be completed by September, the company said in a statement.

 While we recognize that people with CF with minimal function mutations have a form of the disease that is particularly difficult to treat, we believed it was important to evaluate whether a dual combination of VX-661 and ivacaftor could provide some benefit to these patients given they do not today have a medicine to treat the cause of their disease,  said Jeffrey Chodakewitz, EVP and chief medical officer at Vertex.

 These results suggest that a triple combination regimen may provide this group of people with CF the best chance at obtaining a meaningful benefit and we look forward to beginning the first study of a next-generation corrector together with VX-661 and ivacaftor in this group of patients later this year, pending data from our ongoing Phase I studies in healthy volunteers. 

Vertex said despite this setback, it still expects to submit an NDA to the FDA for a Kalydeco/VX-661 cocktail treatment in the second half of 2017, pending data from its remaining Phase III trials. The NDA will include data from the study in people with minimal function mutations, the company added.

Vertex already has a combo CF treatment on the market in the form of Orkambi (ivacaftor and lumacaftor), which has a U.S. license for CF in patients who have two copies of the F508del mutation (F508del/F508del) in their CFTR gene.

Analysts at Jefferies did not see the dropping of one of the studies as terminal to its CF pipeline, saying in a note to clients,  We believe expectations were low [for this subpopulation], and this does not change our overall positive CF franchise view. 

But Jefferies said that the  (f)ew details in PR or from company discussions make it difficult to have any increased clarity on '661's ultimate likelihood of success in other populations, though timelines for those other Phase IIIs appear intact.

 Vertex is still not disclosing the bar for this interim analysis, so it is difficult to know if any small signals activity were observed, though we believe if there were any lung function benefits worth following up on the study would likely have proceeded to part 2. 

Vertex traded down 3.2% after hours last night when the news was released, having ended the normal day s trading nearly 1% up.

The California-based Scintilla, which has been wholly owned by the biosimilar and oncology biotech Sorrento, is buying into Scintilla's lead program: a nonopiate epidural steroid injectable to treat chronic back pain that is slated to start Phase III trials next year.

This dovetails with Scintilla s own lead program resiniferatoxin (a.k.a. RTX), which is being tested in patients with intractable cancer pain, and is set for Phase II tests starting in 2017.

The merger deal sees Scintilla pay out $60 million upfront to Semnur s equity holders--which will be made up of $40 million in cash and $20 million in shares of common stock of Sorrento.

There will also be an extra cash boost worth up to $140 million from Scintilla to Semnur's equity holders, should its drug hit certain sales and development targets in the coming years.

This also comes after Scintilla penned a deal to acquire Malvern, PA-based SCILEX Pharmaceuticals just last week, whose lead product is for the chronic pain that can come with shingles.

When both deals are formally closed, Scintilla said it will then:  Operate as a standalone company focused on pain management,  with  key members  of Semnur s management team set to take a seat on Scintilla s existing executive table.

Dr. Henry Ji, president and CEO of Sorrento, said:  Upon completion of the pending acquisitions and integrations of Semnur and SCILEX, Scintilla will immediately become a truly unique pain management company with a multiple product pipeline and an experienced management team led by Jaisim Shah from Semnur and Anthony Mack from SCILEX. 

 The acquisition by Scintilla reflects the strength of Semnur's technology, IP and tremendous potential of our lead product candidate,  added Mahendra Shah, executive chairman of Semnur Pharmaceuticals, and MD of Vivo Capital.

 We are excited to join Scintilla and be a part of such a dynamic company that will be a major player in the pain management space.

The report, coming out from Kineticos--in partnership with Ipsos Healthcare and Demy-Colton--asked 51 biotech CEOs across small and large cap companies how healthy their sector felt in Q2 when compared to the previous quarter.

The answer sheet came back positive on the money side, with CEOs marking the  very confident  box when it came to raising capital in the public market, jumping from a lowly 18% marking the same box in Q1 to a healthier 39% three months later.

And 98% of CEOs said they are either  very confident  (53%) or  somewhat confident  (45%) in their companies and the overall industry.

While deal values and deal competition remained stable, those labeling the overall deal landscape as  good  declined for a third straight quarter (45% in Q1 to 35% in Q2).

When it comes to the regulatory side of things, confidence is slowly rising, although it could only really go up after only 22% of surveyed CEOs said back in Q1 that they were  very confident  in the regulatory environment. In the second quarter, this had edged up to 31%.

On top of this, 75% said they expect the frequency in FDA approvals over the next 18-month period to remain stable.

But when it comes to CEOs planning to partner externally, Q2 saw a decrease in confidence (70% to 65%)--although this remains significantly higher than those planning to market their meds on their own (just 12%).

What s the biggest threat to biotech s future? Unsurprisingly, more than half (57%) of chiefs asked said the largest risk to their business remains getting enough money in to keep going, and comes after several biotechs such as the Cambridge, MA-based cancer company Bind have filed for bankruptcy in the past quarter.

This concern was much higher than the risk of poor clinical results, which was the biggest concern for only 14%.

When asked about the Q2 results, Steve Girling, president of Ipsos Healthcare said:  After a year of surveying biotech CEOs who are leading development stage companies, we've found that early exuberance about the flow of available funds has been replaced by a broader confidence in the potential to bring new assets to market.

 The upcoming U.S. election is likely to have a material impact on the industry, so it will be fascinating to see whether, and how quickly this influences CEO confidence.

Now, Sorrento has brought on a former Celgene ($CELG) Chief Medical Officer Dr. Jerome Zeldis as CMO and President of Clinical Development. He was with the biopharma for almost 20 years, most recently under the joint title of CEO of Celgene Global Health and CMO.

""Sorrento has an impressive portfolio of unique assets that I believe will clearly differentiate themselves in addressing unmet medical needs in a multitude of markets,  Zeldis said in a statement.

At Celgene, he oversaw clinical trial development of Celgene molecules. He was the Associate Director of Clinical Research at Sandoz Research Institute and the Director of Medical Development at Janssen Pharmaceutical Research Institute prior to his position with Celgene.

Zeldis was already quite active amongst smaller biopharmas; he is the board chairman at Alliqua, Semorex, and Trek Therapeutics, as well as vice chairman at MetaStat. He also serves on the boards of Kalytera Therapeutics, BioSig Technologies, IR Biosciences Holdings, PTC Therapeutics, and Soligenix.

He continued,  Jerry's appointment highlights our focus on investing in clinical development and our steadfast commitment to Sorrento shareholders following the recent $150 million private placement led by Ally Bridge Group completed in June of this year.""

In May, Sorrento had been subject to criticism from activist investor Wildcat Capital Management for its prolific creations of subsidiaries and joint ventures which the investor was concerned is resulting in significant expenditures without offering returns.

Wall Street seemed pleased with the addition of Zeldis, sending Sorrento shares up 5% in early trading after the news.

The pharma has said it is looking to combinations, in particular with another of its immunotherapies, Yervoy (ipilimumab), as a way forward on Opdivo in untreated NSCLC; the relatively low 5% rate of PD-L1 expression used in the trial, as opposed to that used in a similar study of competitor Keytruda (pembrolizumab) from Merck ($MRK), was also widely criticized by industry observers.

Under the new clinical development collaboration with Bavarian Nordic, BMS will supply Opdivo for a Phase II clinical trial in combination with CV301 to treat previously treated NSCLC patients. The Bavarian candidate targets cancer antigens CEA and MUC1 and upregulates PD-L1. The companies hope that the combination, a PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibitor, will offer greater benefit than Opdivo alone.

The trial is slated to enroll about 160 patients and will specifically be in patients with previously treated NSCLC--an indication for which Opdivo is already FDA-approved. Bavarian Nordic retains all rights to CV301, which was originally developed by the National Cancer Institute.

 While we have discussed the potential benefit of combining our cancer vaccines with checkpoint inhibitors for some time, this is now within reach as we have once again been able to strike an agreement with the leading immune-oncology company in the world, this time to explore the potential synergy between our programs to benefit patients with lung cancer,  said Bavarian Nordic President and CEO Paul Chaplin in a statement.

He added,  We look forward to the initiation of this study later this year, 

The initial partnership between Bavarian and Bristol-Myers dates back to March 2015--and is worth up to $1 billion. It s specifically an option deal for the former s Prostvac, a prostate-specific antigen (PSA)-targeting cancer immunotherapy to treat prostate cancer.

At the time of the deal, Prostvac was already in an investigator-sponsored Phase II trial in combination with BMS s Yervoy. The partners planned to do one or more exploratory combination studies of Prostvac with BMS immuno-oncology agents.

The two companies will specifically combine both meds in patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma (RCC), a form of kidney cancer, with Bristol-Myers supplying its blockbuster drug for use in the Phase I/II Aveo-sponsored TiNivo trial.

The early-stage test will be assessed with escalating doses of tivozanib with Opvido, and then be followed by an expansion Phase II cohort at an established combination dose.

The trial will be led by the Institut Gustave Roussy in Paris under the direction of Professor Bernard Escudier, chairman of the Genitourinary Oncology Committee.

This will be a much needed positive R&D update for the biotech, which has been beleaguered by problems from its VEGF inhibitor for years.

First up in its history, the FDA shot down its hoped-for approval in renal cell carcinoma, calling its pivotal data ""uninterpretable"" and leading the biotech to lay off more than half of its staff. Then, in December 2013, Astellas and Aveo further dashed hopes for the VEGF blocker by revealing that it was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint in a study on colorectal cancer.

Finally, in early 2014, the two shut down a Phase II study on tivozanib in breast cancer when it failed to enroll enough patients, which looked to have closed the book on the drug's last potential indication.

All of this saw Aveo, now known as Aveo Oncology, badly hit, losing Biogen ($BIIB) and then Astellas as research partners before falling into penny-stock territory and being forced to make a series of job cuts.

But the company is, doggedly, still seeking a reprieve for tivozanib, and in December its shares shot up by 27% after it announced a European licensing pact for the drug. It is also continuing with a trial of the drug as a monotherapy.

Remarkably, however, it got worse when the SEC handed down a $4 million penalty in March of this year. The fine came while seeking to ban three of its former execs from leading any company ever again after allegedly misleading investors on the safety of tivozanib.

The SEC, via a court in Boston, alleges that Aveo deliberately withheld the fact that the FDA had deep concerns about the drug in its public statements in 2012 and 2013, and failed to tell investors that the regulator wanted a second clinical trial to address concerns about the patient death rate during the first study.

The firm never did undertake that second trial and it was left to the FDA--which rejected the drug three years ago--to tell the public about its concerns, promptly sending the firm's stock price down by 31%.

Aveo raised $53 million in a public offering of its stock in January 2013--all while failing to disclose that the FDA staff had explicitly recommended a second study for tivozanib, according to the SEC.

BMS, too, has hit a recent R&D snag with its seemingly all-conquering Opdivo, which already has a license to treat advanced RCC patients in a second-line setting.

The drug was looking to bump itself up the pathway in non-small cell lung cancer, but this month flubbed a key late-stage trial, hampering its chances of a first-line setting in the disease. Both will hope to have better luck with their combined approach to kidney cancer.

 The introduction of immunotherapies has greatly improved outcomes in renal cell carcinoma, and combination therapy is the obvious next step in advancing treatment,  said Professor Escudier.

Dr. Michael Needle, chief medical officer of Aveo, added:  This study has the potential to unlock a more effective, better tolerated new treatment approach in RCC. We appreciate Bristol-Myers Squibb s support for this study, and we look forward to working with Dr. Escudier and his team to fully understand this potential. 

Aveo ended Q2 with $39.5 million in cash, according to its latest financials posted this month.

Canadian biotech Aurinia Pharmaceuticals ($AUPH) posted the topline results from its Phase IIb AURA-LV study this morning in a test that was focused on patients with active lupus nephritis (LN), a form of the disease known as lupus or systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), which has a number of subpopulations and complications from the broader condition.

Lupus kidney disease (a.k.a. lupus nephritis) is one of the most serious and potentially life-threatening complications of this autoimmune disease, affecting as many as 60% of people with lupus.

The biotech said that its trial hit the primary endpoint by showing statistically significantly greater complete remission of the disease in patients treated with voclosporin twice a day over 24 weeks of treatment.

The trial pitted voclosporin added to current standard-of-care therapy, namely Roche s ($RHHBY) organ rejection drug CellCept (mycophenolate mofetil), against placebo plus CellCept in achieving complete remission in 265 patients with active LN.

Data showed that 32.6% of patients in the low dose voclosporin arm, 27.3% in the high dose arm and 19.3% in the control arm achieved complete remission (CR), the study s primary endpoint. Patients treated with voclosporin were also twice as likely to achieve CR compared with placebo. But the market has not responded well to these data, with its shares down around 50% pre-market.

Analysts at Leerink said that the stock was trading down because there were 13 deaths across the study, with 10 in the low dose arm of the drug. The company said however that these deaths were due to the severe underlying nature of the disease, and not its drug.

 While this does naturally raise questions, it is important to be mindful that these lupus nephritis patients were extremely sick and treated at many sites with differing practice patterns in Asia, some of which we believe were in much less developed places,  Leerink said in a note to clients.

 The company noted that there were no clear underlying patterns among the deaths, and that one patient (who achieved complete remission) for example had baseline proteinurea of 29 grams, which was the highest value they have ever seen in their entire career of treating lupus patients. 

After talking with the biotech s exec team this morning, Leerink said that it was  incrementally more comfortable that the FDA will view the risk/benefit of voclosporin favorably. 

The firm added:  We believe that AUPH shares would not be trading down so precipitously (if at all) if this were made clearer [ ] All of the deaths occurred in much less developed places including Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and Russia, and no Americans died in the study. 

It also said on the efficacy side that at first glance, the effectiveness seen in the drug arms  looks lower than what we had expected, but is still respectable. 

The drug works as a calcineurin inhibitor and as an immunosuppressant. By inhibiting calcineurin, voclosporin blocks IL-2 expression and T-cell mediated immune responses.

 We are very pleased by these encouraging results and are grateful to those that participated in our clinical trials,  said Neil Solomons, Aurinia s CMO.

 The AURA study was conducted under rigorous and stringent criteria, enhancing our confidence in voclosporin s potential ability to provide a substantial improvement over the currently accepted standard of care, especially given that study participants had such active disease and were exposed to such a low corticosteroid load. We continue to work diligently towards our goal of improving long-term outcomes for these patients. 

Aurinia said in a statement that it now plans to meet with the FDA at the end of the year to:  Discuss these data and the drug s subsequent clinical development and path to registration in LN. 

There are still more data to be presented, however, and the study will continue through 48 weeks, with results set to be released early next year.

A number of companies are looking into lupus treatments, including Biogen s ($BIIB) anti-BDCA2 antibody that is currently in Phase I and UCB s dapirolizumab pegol, an anti-CD40 ligand currently in early-stage trials that is expected to move into midstage by year s end. Biogen also recently snuck in a new lupus treatment, a Bruton s tyrosine kinase (Btk) inhibitor known as BIIB068, into the clinic earlier this year.

SLE is a difficult-to-treat disease with a number of variations and subpopulations of patients such as LN--but one littered with late-stage failures.

A few years ago, GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) became the first drugmaker in more than half a century to gain approval for a new treatment for the disease in the form of Benlysta (belimumab).

The drug, a human monoclonal antibody that selectively targets B-lymphocyte stimulator, has however struggled to make much of a sales impact for the company since its FDA approval in 2011.

Benlysta has a license for patients with active, autoantibody positive SLE who are receiving standard therapy--but brought home just  230 million ($338 million) in 2015. It has not, however, been approved for severe active lupus nephritis.

Other candidates are also in the mix for lupus, including UCB s epratuzumab--although this failed two Phase III trials last year after missing its primary endpoints. AstraZeneca ($AZN) also posted positive Phase II data for its SLE candidate anifrolumab last year. Eli Lilly ($LLY) had been testing its drug tabalumab for the condition, but this was axed in 2014 after it too failed several pivotal late-stage studies.

Anthera Pharmaceuticals  blisibimod, which focuses on anti-BAFF activity in LSE, is still going in mid- to late-stage studies. And in May, a new startup biotech called Thunderbolt was launched as the brainchild of Baxalta, the Mayo Clinic and Velocity Pharmaceutical Development, with a focus on SLE, also via an anti-BAFF mechanism.

The moves see the Roche ($RHHBY) spinout discard the antibiotic 11 months after revealing its interest in the program, and go after a new indication with its small molecule tumor checkpoint controller.

Basel, Switzerland-based Basilea went public with its inhaled antibiotic plans in September, at which time it committed  5.5 million ($6.1 million) to a consortium to hustle the drug toward the clinic. The drug, monosulfactam antibiotic BAL30072, was part of a 5-year Innovative Medicines Initiative that is funneling  50.7 million into the development of treatments for chronic lung infections in patients with cystic fibrosis and bronchiectasis. Novartis ($NVS) is also involved in the project.

Basilea, however, thinks its inhaled antibiotic is unlikely to make the grade, prompting it to put the program on the scrapheap before advancing as far as Phase I. BAL30072 was selected for the inhaled antibiotic project on the basis of in vitro and in vivo evidence of its activity against numerous multidrug-resistant Gram-negative bacteria, but a full review of data generated to date has led it to conclude the drug is lacking overall.

The decision marks another blow for BAL30072. An intravenous form of the antibiotic has stuttered through early-stage development for years. Basilea first tested the antibiotic in humans in 2011, at which time it was aiming to have the drug in Phase II by 2013. That target came and went. Basilea landed an $89 million contract with BARDA in 2013, leading to the initiation of a Phase I combination study the following year. Elevated liver enzyme levels limited dosing in Phase I.

With Basilea scrapping the inhaled antibiotic project and the BARDA contract ending after the initial funding period, BAL30072 appears to have run out of new avenues to pursue. But, while a door has closed on the antibiotic, another has opened for Basilea s tumor checkpoint controller BAL101553. Having generated evidence the small molecule can penetrate brain tissue and act against tumors in the organ, Basilea is expanding its clinical development program to include glioblastoma.

The plan is to start adding patients with this form of brain cancer to an ongoing Phase I/IIa trial of an oral form of BAL101553 by the end of the year. To date, the study has enrolled patients with other types of solid tumors.

The topline data from Redwood City, Californian-based specialty pharma co AcelRx Pharmaceuticals ($ACRX) were posted from a small, single-arm, open-label Phase III trial of ARX-04 (sufentanil sublingual tablet, 30 mcg) in patients who presented to the emergency room with moderate-to-severe acute pain associated with trauma or injury.

The study--in part funded by the Department of Defense to assess how well this drug might help soldiers injured in the line of duty--saw the 76 patients treated with ARX-04 have an overall mean pain intensity difference to baseline (PID) of 2.9 from a baseline of 8.1, or 35%, on a 0 to 10 rating scale at 60 minutes after taking the med.

The small cap company has not in its statement, however, provided any primary endpoints, and the study itself is very small and not comparative, so a definitive takeaway is not easy to make.

There is also the deeper problem of measuring pain in this clinical setting. In the 2014 paper:  Clinical importance of changes in chronic pain intensity measured on an 11-point numerical pain rating scale , authors writing in the Pain journal say that it is:  Difficult to interpret the clinical importance of changes from baseline on this scale (such as a 1- or 2-point change). To date, there are no data driven estimates for clinically important differences in pain intensity scales used for chronic pain studies. 

The drug itself, which is a powerful opioid stronger than morphine and its parent med fentanyl, is a higher dose version of the company s EU-approved Zalviso (sufentanil sublingual tablet system) for severe post-op pain. In Europe, the drug is marketed with Grunenthal.

Zalviso is in fact a hybrid of Sufent--a treatment which has been authorized in the Netherlands since 1978 as an anesthetic-analgesic. But Zalviso, which is a drug-device system, has had less luck in the U.S., and is currently producing new trials after receiving a complete response letter from the FDA back in 2014.

ARX-04, which is used under the tongue through a disposable, prefilled, single-dose applicator, saw its Phase III carried out in two cohorts.

Drilling down into these data, the first part assessed 40 patients using the experimental drug while the second extension phase enrolled 36 adults who could get up to four doses of ARX-04, given hourly as needed for pain.

Interim results posted back in February from the first cohort showed that patients treated with a single dose of ARX-04 experienced a mean pain intensity decrease from baseline of 2.7 at 60 minutes.

The latest data show that patients in the second cohort reported a mean pain intensity decrease from baseline of 3.1 on the 0 to 10 pain intensity scale, again after one hour.

Of these 36 patients, 7 received a second dose of ARX-04, and two received a third dose. For 75% of patients in the second cohort, a single dose of ARX04 was sufficient for pain relief and 8% of patients received morphine in addition to ARX-04.

 The Department of Defense, which has provided us with development funding for ARX-04, suggested that we conduct a cognitive impairment assessment to determine if ARX-04 causes cognitive deficiencies, which is an understandable concern when treating wounded soldiers on the battlefield,  explained Dr. Pamela Palmer, co-founder and chief medical officer of AcelRx Pharmaceuticals.

 In addition to putting combat units in danger, drug-induced cognitive effects can impede diagnosis and treatment in a civilian emergency room. If borne out, ARX-04 s onset of pain relief, sublingual dosage form and side effect profile could make it an attractive option for doctors considering opioid analgesic treatment in emergency rooms and field-based settings. 

The ARX-04 Phase III clinical program is made up of three studies in patients with moderate-to-severe acute pain.

The first, SAP301, is a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in ambulatory abdominal surgery patients; the second is SAP302, an open-label trial in adult emergency room patients; and SAP303, an open-label trial in postoperative patients.

The company closed up 5% at the end of play on Friday, before these data were released. It currently has a market cap of just $177 million, nearly half the $382 million it had last March just before it announced the need for more trials for its Zalviso NDA resubmission to the FDA.

As for overt sexual harassment, 30% of women said they had experienced it compared to 4% of men.

The findings dovetail with previous research that has found ongoing disparities between men and women in faculty rank at U.S. medical schools, Census data indicating that female physicians and surgeons earn just 69% of what males do, and that women account for only 18% of U.S. hospital CEOs.

While Jagsi's study focused on those in academic medicine, practice-based physicians likely experience harassment at a comparable rate, Emily Martin of the National Women s Law Center told Medical Economics.

 Based on studies we have seen, it seems to be at least one in four women and as many as 60% of women in some occupations are experiencing sexual harassment on the job. Doctors, unfortunately, are not exempt from that pattern,  she said.

Jagsi suggested the medical field cannot simply count on waiting for the larger proportion of women in medical school to naturally lead to a larger proportion of women in leadership roles in the future, given that there continues to be gender inequality in medicine, perhaps sometimes from unconscious bias and assumptions about gender roles.

There needs to be a commitment from the top at healthcare institutions, Martin told Medical Economics, to ensure clear anti-harassment policies, clear complaint procedures that don't require going through a supervisor, and conduct staff training.

Nabel, who received compensation worth a total of $5.4 million in 2014, for an increase of 119% from her $2.5 million compensation in 2013. The difference was primarily due to Nabel 's  compensation in 2014, because she vested that year in a retirement plan from corporate parent Partners HealthCare, the largest hospital network in the state.

Numerous other hospital executives around the state saw their 2014 pay packages go up from anywhere between 7% and 70%, the Globe reported. Meanwhile, overall healthcare spending in Massachusetts rose 4.8% that year--significantly less than executive compensation, but more than the state's 3.6% targeted limit.

Former Partners chief executive Gary L. Gottlieb received a 19% compensation boost that year to $3.1 million, though the company noted two other executives saw their totals go down as a result of changes in retirement vesting amounts.

Since its release, 13 healthcare organizations have adopted the framework, although Carequality member Cerner is not one of them.

As hospitals and health systems become more wired with EHRs and other health IT technologies, interoperability has remained a challenge. For one thing, different medical device and health IT manufacturers each have their own proprietary interface technology, so there s no way to connect the disparate parts. Interoperability has also been hampered by the lack of an overarching architecture and standards.

The federal government has been working to improve interoperability as well. Last October, the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology released its final roadmap on interoperability, with the aim of making the U.S. healthcare system fully interoperable by 2025. In January the Food and Drug Administration issued draft guidance on design for manufacturers of medical devices.

The industry-wide push for improving health IT systems and devices as well as increasing interoperable solutions could be key for the success of population health management. But from hospitals to pharmacies, patient data is gathered across a variety of disparate systems and devices so hospitals and health systems face several challenges with interoperability.

For example only 23% of hospitals in 2014 were able to use their EHR to ""find, send, receive and use electronic information due to substantial barriers,"" according to the American Hospital Association. A 2015 GAO report found such challenges could include insufficient health data standards, different state privacy rules, and accurately matching patients' health records.

Healthcare Dive spoke to Jitin Asnaani, executive director of the CommonWell Health Alliance, a nonprofit trade association with a focus on cross-vendor interoperability, about the current interoperability barriers to keep the conversation on solutions for interoperability going. Asnaani is the former standard and interoperability coordinator at the Department of Health and Human Services, and he served as the director of athenahealth for about three years.  

Healthcare Dive: Why has CommonWell focused so heavily on helping health IT vendors achieve interoperability goals?

Jitin Asnaani, CommonWell Health Alliance executive director: The mission is wherever a patient goes to get care, there is a follow-up snapshot. It's a fairly simple mission but there s a lot of complexity behind it. One of the key values that correlates to our mission is that we believe that the access to patients  data should be accessible in the system the caregiver uses to take care of them. When you take that sort of approach, you really do need a strong collaborative effort of the organizations that are participating because we want to be able to enable all customers to access everyone else s data. So, we have to ensure that your product is updated and that allows new users to be able to get data from the network to take care of their patients.

Asnaani: Once you build the software, it's not like we all use Windows 1.0. There are a lot of versions and most versions get better and better and better. So, the hard part is to continuously develop and improve [interoperability] just like any other product feature that you have already built within the old platform walls. It's not actually that hard but that's what takes a little bit of time.

Healthcare Dive: What are some of the other priorities EHR vendors have?

Asnaani: Having worked at an EHR vendor previously, I have a very good sense of what EHR vendors spend their resources on. It seems we should often expect, for example, improving the usability of their product and improving the number of features available in their product. One of the the beauties and curse of the U.S. is that we have tremendous sub-specialization in healthcare and each subspecialist needs a different workflow or a different type of data. So, if [the EHR vendor] wants to serve all of the subspecialties in the U.S., that is in the vicinity of 200 sub-specialties, which means 200 different workflows. Each one requires significant work. We need those engineers to do much more valuable things around population health. Interoperability is no longer a vice to have like it was 20 years ago but actually crucial now that we need care coordination between sub-specialists and specialists and nurses and social workers and so on. The space between the care is actually just as important as the care itself.

Asnaani: From the health system's point of view, more and more health systems are not accountable only for their hospital. Even independent physicians are responsible for a patient even when they leave. So I need to make sure wherever they go they are healthy. So there s a direct benefit because payments are being adjusted by how healthy patients are regardless of whether or not the patient is in your specific four walls or not, which is why the demand for interoperability has been surging over the last few years.

Healthcare Dive: Has the healthcare industry removed any barriers to interoperability as of yet?

Asnaani: The biggest one for a while was we did not have standards defined. We can define how to exchange the data and when data arrived at a different location, how it could be interpreted. There s a lot more improvement to be made there but there was a big gaping hole before.

Healthcare Dive: What are some of the remaining barriers?

Asnaani: Now, the biggest barriers that I'm seeing are really two issues. One is within the provider organizations where for the first time providers actually have the opportunity to collaborate with each other. After so many years of not being able to do so, it is a cultural change for the provider to realize that they should be getting the data, that they did get the data when and where they wanted. It s also a challenge for the vendors because for the first time providers are saying, ""Hey, I actually wanted that data. I thought I could get it but I couldn t."" So, the old barrier used to be supply of interoperability, the new barrier is how do you stimulate the demand for interoperability now that you actually can exchange data and providers are using it. So, I'm very excited because that means that people are using our software to actually try to do the job we want them to do.

Healthcare Dive: What is the second big issue you're seeing?

Asnaani: There is variability on privacy in the consent laws from one state to the next and that s a little challenging, especially if you are a national network and you want to make a simple and straightforward experience that s relatively uniform. You want to be Google. You don't want to make a Google New York and a Google Texas. You want to do a single service called Google, which everybody can use and you type in a topic and you get data. In our case, you type in a patient and you get data on the patient. Right now we don't look different from state to state because we have a conservative approach but if we could make the system more intelligent, there would be an evaluation of some states  laws. Unfortunately, some states have made it more complicated for the state than they need to be.

Healthcare Dive: Are there any hurdles associated with the provider's experience?

Asnaani: Another barrier is when you ask providers, ""What is it about the interoperability experience that you like and don't like?,"" what they like is getting new data that will help with the patient and the degree that the data is most relevant. What they don't like is the added friction, another window that they have to go through, another system that they have to log onto, another set of clicks they have to make. That is huge in the user experience because its not really a Google experience if you have to wait five minutes for a page to load. You would stop using Google and that is why providers don't interoperate. They know they have to go to a different portal, remember a different password, a different username, and try to get that data to the patient. They really don't have time for it.

Healthcare Dive: What should be the federal government's role in this?

Asnaani: The role of the federal government now is painting some of the end goals. What is the behavior for interoperability? What does an outcome for patient engagement look like? What are good metrics of measuring how well and how healthy our patients are? Facilitating those forward-looking discussions rather than the tactical,  Heres the standard that we re going to use.

","http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/florida-blue-touts-intimate-aca-market-knowledge-as-key-to-success/424662/","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 17:31:07 -0400","NA","Florida Blue touts 'intimate' ACA market knowledge as key to successFlorida Blue does contrast in several ways with Aetna, Geraghty pointed out, with the company being a nonprofit and serving 700,000 ACA plan enrollees in one state, vs. Aetna serving about 800,000 ACA plan enrollees spread across the U.S.

""The big nationals aren't quite as in touch with local markets and it makes a very big difference,"" he told CNBC.

Geraghty also credited Florida Blue with anticipating and planning for its new ACA plan enrollees to be sicker and costlier than its other customers, an issue that has hammered other insurers to a higher degree than anticipated.

The insurer helped head off the issue by opening 20 retail centers around the state to help people enroll and get an immediate risk assessment in order to address problems right away.

Some other Blue plans have fared and strategized differently, however. Blue Shield of California has notably responded to its ACA losses by planning a week-long shutdown in September, eliminating almost 400 jobs and raising its 2017 rates almost 20%. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama is awaiting approval of an average ACA plan rate increase of 39%.

Earlier this week, Aetna, the nation's third largest insurer, announced late Monday evening it was leaving a not insignificant share of the ACA marketplaces on which it currently offers individual plans. In fact, it was a pretty big deal. CEO Mark Bertolini announced the carrier would stop selling on-exchange plans from 778 counties across 15 states to 242 counties in four states, nearly a 70% participation reduction. To borrow a phrase seldom used in healthcare news, then the internet exploded.

Not even 31 hours later after Aetna's announcement, The Huffington Post revealed the insurer in early July threatened to pull out of the ACA exchanges if the Obama administration attempted to block Aetna's pending merger with Humana. (The Justice Department did file a suit on July 21 against the merger. Twenty-six days later, Aetna made it's decision on ACA market participation). That's when the think pieces and the explainers really started picking up across the web.

Some noted Aetna's exit along with other major insurers retreating from the exchanges could put the idea of a public option in the national spotlight come election time this year. Others noted that narrower networks and ""intimate knowledge"" of regional markets help insurers earn money on the exchanges. Andy Slavitt, CMS acting administrator, went on a tweetstorm (aggregated by Politico's Dan Diamond) to share why he thought the market is attractive to insurers for the long haul. In short, Slavitt stated carriers know they need to meet new expectations in a business-to-consumer insurance market and plans need to build and create affordable options as well as customer relationships. Slavitt noted the Medicare Advantage and Medicare Part D markets took time to mature as well.

However, a lot of insurers are currently losing money on the exchanges. Jake Sunderland, public information officer, at Oregon's Department of Consumer and Business Services (ODCBS), told Healthcare Dive the state s seven largest insurers lost $171.6 million in 2015 across all lines of business, compared to a net loss of $46.7 million in 2014, and a gain in net income of $78 million in 2013.

While opinions about what Aetna's market exit means for greater health of the market were in no short supply this week, the truth is that if insurers don't want to participate in the markets, then no one -- including the federal administration -- can make them, as Bloomberg's Zachary Tracer noted.

The result of a few -- and in some cases one -- insurers offering plans in certain locations can lead to higher premiums. But overall, premiums are increasingly whether a region is a competitive market or not. For example, Oregon's final individual premium rates, one of the first states to release approved 2017 premium rates, range from an ""average rate decrease of 8.9% to an average rate increase of 17%."" Silver Standard Plan premiums  -- the most popular plan in the exchanges -- for a 40-year-old in Portland would range from $266 to $362 a month, a prepared release noted.

Sunderland says something that can get lost in the shuffle of conversation over premiums is premium rates are directly related to the cost of healthcare services. Rates that are requested too low will sometimes be pushed up while some requested rates need to be lowered if they are not actuarially sound. ""Our job is to make sure the rates are adequate as well as not excessive to find that sweet spot that allows companies to pay claims and they have a right to a small amount of profit though very few companies are making any money right now.""

From a business participation standpoint, it's somewhat easy to understand why carriers losing money on the exchanges may want to recoup some earlier losses while keeping pace with the general, annual increase of healthcare costs. While the market may stabilize in the future, insurers currently eating the costs of upwards in the millions can't be judged too harshly for not playing into the long game.

""It doesn't do anyone good for companies to become solvent in the middle of the year like we're experiencing now,"" Sunderland added.

Unfortunately, it's the patients and enrollees who suffer as a result of this situation. By Charles Gaba's estimates, 1.6 million individuals or so will need different policies next year. Those estimates are just for those with plans under Aetna, UnitedHealth and Humana; adding numbers from assorted co-ops/small carriers pushes the number up to 1.8 million.

Another part of the reason premiums are increasing next year is the overall greater visibility into the reality of the market. The rate review season for 2017 is the first year that insurers have a full year's worth of claims data under the exchanges. Before this year, premium rates were based on projections. Some to the reasons insurers are losing money on the exchange are because policyholders turned out to be sicker than expected and employers didn't offload their employees onto the exchanges as much as anticipated. ""We were off,"" Sunderland told Healthcare Dive, adding that's not unique to Oregon's individual insurance landscape and he stands by the rate decisions made for the 2014 plan year. ""It's proven to be a challenging environment as carriers are starting to finally get data on what to expect from this population.""

One of the fears for the individual markets -- especially in rural areas -- is if and when all potential carriers cease to offer plans and an entire region's population is shut out of the ACA exchange due to a lack of anyone willing to provide them a plan. While a lone carrier in a market could raise premiums significantly (Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama -- the only major insurer on the state's ACA market -- proposed to raise individual premium rates on the ACA marketplace on average by 39%), not having access to an affordable care plan would be worse. Sunderland notes regulators do not have the authority to compel an insurer to stay in a market it doesn't want to participate in.

Next year, all counties in Oregon will have at least two carriers participating on and off the state's insurance marketplace. But that took some work. While Oregon is a competitive insurance market, some insurers were considering backing out of some of the rural areas of the state.  We are concerned about the shrinking number of options in certain areas of the state, and we asked insurance companies to reconsider their decisions to withdraw,  Patrick Allen, director of the ODCBS, said in a prepared statement.  This is a short-term solution to provide more options in 2017, but we need to focus on long-term solutions to stabilize the individual market. 

The insurers were allowed to adjust premium rates upwards because they were taking on more risk. However, now all Oregonians have options for marketplace plans.

Sunderland notes while regulators enforce -- not make -- policy, a priority for his department includes developing policy ideas to bring to legislation to make it more enticing to get to the root of some of the concerns carriers are experiencing with the exchanges. He adds his department in the past has had success with reinsurance programs to cover high-risk populations and children. ""That's certainly something we are looking at and exploring as we look toward the future.""

While there isn't a single magic bullet being provided, it is generally accepted that something's got to give somewhere to make the marketplace stabilize. CMS officials had recently alluded to policy coming down the line to help strengthen the markets. One action late Thursday signaled the agency is making moves to try and do just that. CMS released a public request for information seeking public comment on concerns that some providers may be employing patient-steering patient eligible for, or receiving, Medicare and/or Medicaid benefits into ACA-compliant individual market plans. Slavitt took to Twitter to make clear today's action is in line with a stronger marketplace for the future:","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

Rather than scaling down its business, Oscar has focused this year on new strategies to reign in its losses.

However, some health insurers like Molina Healthcare, Florida Blue, Centene and Kaiser have found ways to make some money with ACA plans. Narrow provider networks, Medicaid expansion, and high deductibles have led in part to their profitability.

"Salesforce joins growing field of telehealth players with integrated two-way video chat"," The U.S. telehealth market is expected to reach $2.8 billion by 2022, according to Grand View Research. ","http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/salesforce-joins-growing-field-of-telehealth-players-with-integrated-two-wa/424730/","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 09:00:00 -0400","NA","Salesforce joins growing field of telehealth players with integrated two-way video chatCRM leader Salesforce today launched new telehealth features for its Health Cloud patient relationship management solution, enabling two-way video chat that allows patients to connect directly with their care teams via any mobile device.

Powered by Salesforce SOS, the company s branded two-way video chat, the telehealth solution combines three key features: real-time support, providing instant gratification for the patient; contextual care; and ease of use.

The contextual care feature is especially important to enhancing patient care, Joshua Newman, general manager for Salesforce Healthcare and Life Sciences, tells Healthcare Dive.  Unlike other video solutions, this allows you to have video embedded in the application, embedded in the timeline and the care plan and the care team and all the other information that you have on Health Cloud. 

When patients log into the mobile app, Health Cloud automatically recognizes them and brings up their profile, allowing caregivers to quickly get up to speed on their case, and allowing patients to ask questions, check on next appointments or go over post-discharge care plans. Everything shows up in the patient s timeline.

The solution comes as more people are using smartphones and mobile apps to conduct transaction across all industries. According to Salesforce s 2016 Connected Patient Report, nearly two-thirds (62%) of U.S. respondents with a primary care provider and health insurance would be open to virtual care treatments.

Salesforce said it is working closely with its ecosystem of partners   including Silverline, Persistent Systems, and Accenture   to implement the telehealth solution in Health Cloud. The list price is $150 per user per month, on top of the basic Health Cloud fee of $300 per user per month.

In offering the telehealth features, Salesforce joins a growing field of players that includes giants like GE Healthcare, IBM, Philips Healthcare, McKesson, as well as smaller companies and startups.

According to a recent analysis by Grand View Research, the U.S. telehealth market is expected to reach $2.83 billion by 2022, up from $572 million in 2014. Cloud-based products are forecast to be the fastest growing segment over this period, with a compound annual growth rate of 19.5%, the report says.

Fueling that growth are number of factors: a sharp rise in the chronically ill and aging population, physician shortages in many parts of the country, rapid advances in IT capabilities, rising healthcare costs, lowered reimbursement, increasing use of home-based care, and patients  and doctors  growing ease with mobile technologies.

A recent analysis in the New England Journal of Medicine underscores this point, according to Healthcare Informatics. The physician authors point out that increasing policy and reimbursement pressures to create value-based care and expand population health management are fueling demand for telehealth solutions that are convenient and engage the patient, reduce costs, enhance outcomes, strengthen the patient-doctor relationship, and streamline the care delivery process.

Newman says the decision to offer telehealth services at this time was partly pragmatic.  We had Salesforce SOS as part of our service cloud, and it s very easy for us to keep adding to it.  Unveiled in February, the company has committed to introducing new features to Health Cloud every four months.

But there s a deeper reason for this move now, he allows. Increasingly, customers are interested in improving the patient experience   whether that s support for adherence to treatment regimens or coaching or concierge-type services   and they re looking for solutions to help them do that.

What sets Health Cloud s telehealth solution apart from many others in the marketplace, says Newman, is that it offers real contextual care.  There are dozens of companies that have video and there are dozens of companies that have patient engagement. My experience has been that most of them are separate   and what they don t get is the context. 

Salesforce is not entirely alone in this space. Last year, Mesa, AZ-based health tech startup eVisit launched a telemedicine platform that offers secure, high-resolution, two-way video chat between providers and their patients. The software also facilitates reimbursement for providers from third-party payers.

American Well also offers telehealth platform with two-way video chat that includes access to updated patient health information at the point of engagement.

Unlike most industries, which industrialized a century ago, healthcare is trying to industrialize as it adopts newer, more sophisticated technologies.  That s a very taxing and scary proposition,  Newman says. At the same time, many are cash-strapped, having spent much of their capital on establishing EMR networks.

 What we have to do is help them grow and help them solve more proximal problems,  he adds. The other piece is technology, he says   offering customers integrated solutions that can easily be upgraded and expanded.

 It s the idea of getting healthcare on a track of constant innovation, agile growth and being able to accommodate changes at a pace that s orders of magnitude faster than what they used to do,  Newman says.  And with the speed comes the cost savings. ","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

The FDA has no plans to ease off of its increasingly aggressive inspection practices in China, India and elsewhere. The agency does, however, provide some advice to companies that are in violation. As the agency told Concept Products in its warning letter:

Last month for example,  the EMA recommended the suspension of marketing authorization for dozens of generic drugs that relied on bioequivalence studies from the India-based Semler Research Centre, after concluding the center's studies were flawed. The European Commission is currently weighing that recommendation.

As for the violations at Artemis Biotech's API facility, they included failure to keep important GMP data in the quality management system, data integrity problems and abysmal record-keeping. And although the likelihood of recalls is low, there is a chance that the EMA will pull the facility's manufacturing certificate.

While approval times have dramatically decreased, Avalere Health argues that the $300 million in unspent fees should be used to accelerate approval timelines further.

""The significant unspent funds left over from user fee programs suggest that FDA could do more to accelerate product reviews,"" Jay Jackson, manager at Avalere, said in a statement. ""Particularly with public concern around drug prices, speeding approval of the second-to-market products can increase competition that may result in lower net prices.""

There are currently multiple types of prescription drug user fees, including product fees that are paid for marketed products; establishment fees that are paid by all manufacturers annually; and application review fees that are paid when an application is submitted.

Fees have been steadily rising. In 2016, a prescription drug application that includes clinical data has an application fee of more than $2.3 million to the FDA.

45 novel drugs were approved in 2015, significantly more than in previous years when the average number of novel drugs approved was 28.

The current PDUFA program is set to expire in September 2017 and negotiations for PDUFA VI are already underway.

"Innovation in Quality Metrics","The FDA is collaborating with industry to develop a groundbreaking new set of state-of-quality metrics","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/innovation-in-quality-metrics/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 16:17:00 -0400","NA","Innovation in Quality MetricsIn the world of pharmaceutical production, it is universally understood that a robust pharmaceutical quality system provides key elements of assurance and oversight for pharmaceutical manufacturing processes. It ensures that patients are provided with medications that are safe, effective, and reliably produced at a high level of quality. However, despite recent advances in the manufacturing sector, quality issues remain a frequent occurrence, and can result in recalls, withdrawals, or harm to patients. Quality issues have also been linked to the rise in critical drug shortages. 

Regulatory agencies currently assesses the risk profile of manufacturing sites based primarily on their compliance history, as seen in warning letters and field reports, in conjunction with records on product recalls and market-based quality problems. These are not necessarily the most informative measures, and by their nature, provide historical or lagging data or signal detection. More relevant data relating to the state-of-quality, provided in advance, would better inform the risk factors that might predict quality problems and future drug shortages.

FDA s approach to quality oversight has evolved in recent years, and the new Office of Pharmaceutical Quality (OPQ) has made it a priority to establish a sounder basis for ensuring that pharmaceutical products meet high quality standards throughout the product lifecycle

This FDA led Research Project initiates a program aimed at developing and implementing a set of standardized manufacturing quality metrics. The establishment and collection of these metrics should provide various stakeholders   from industry to regulators   with greater insight into the state-of-quality at a given manufacturing facility, and allow stakeholders to better anticipate and address quality issues while simultaneously reducing unnecessary regulatory burden.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE QUALITY METRICS INITIATIVE

Since early 2013, FDA has been working with the pharmaceutical industry to develop goals and objectives for a metrics program. In response, several industry stakeholder groups have worked with FDA to develop consensus around the goals, as well as identify potential metric sets, including developing recommendations for their implementation and interpretation. Through a series of extensive engagements between industry and FDA there has been an acknowledgement of the complexity of the problem at hand, which is to develop a recommeded set of metrics which are objective and meaningful, easy to capture yet normalized to account for factors such as process differences and technical complexity. Furthermore, it is required that those elements selected will promote acceptable behaviors and not lead to any unintended consquences or unwanted behaviors.

Key Research Questions to Address in the Selection of a Proposed Metrics Set:

1. What is the appropriate set of metrics to collect for establishing the state-of-quality at a manufacturing facility?

2. Will this set of metrics provide adequate information for all types of pharmaceutical manufacturing, such as sterile injectables, bio-pharmaceuticals?

3. How should these metrics be defined?

4. What is the optimal reporting process and what support will be necessary to facilitate timely and uniform reporting.

5. What are the potential unintended consequences which may arise with chosen metrics?

a. Such as measuring OOS rate may result in companies not reporting OOS results or changing their standards of identifying OOS results to minimize the numbers.

b. Review of complaint trending might lead firms to resolve problems superficially without getting to root cause.

6. How can the FDA prevent manipulation of data and its unintended consequences?

7. How does company culture impact the data collection and the metrics?

8. How does the underlying quality culture of a manufacturing facility influence quality performance and how does one correlate its impact through these metrics?

9. How can one represent a set of complex behavior and performance criteria via a set of simple metrics?

10. How can these set of metrics be linked to operating efficiency and performance of the plants? Plants are naturally focused towards improving their profitability and cost. Significant efforts such as six sigma, lean, right-first-time programs are underway across the industry and have deep rooted support in many pharmaceutical operations around the world. Can the reportable quality metrics be a natural offshoot of such improvement programs?

ROLE OF QUALITY METRICS IN RISK-BASED SURVEILLANCE

Quality metrics are widely used throughout the pharmaceutical industry to monitor quality control systems and processes, and many of the components that inform those metrics (e.g., data on process capability output or statistical process control) are already collected and maintained as part of cGMP compliance. Several measures of performance are already common throughout the industry. The challenege is that they are currently defined differently across manufacturers, and even between sites operated by the same manufacturer.

The proposed FDA Quality Metrics program is not the first of its kind; rather, it draws from the example of existing private sector quality improvement programs that collect voluntarily reported, standardized quality metrics from a large and varying array of manufacturing sites, which are then used by participating manufacturers to benchmark their performance against industry standards and their peers.

The collection and analysis of standardized quality metrics can serve several functions:

  At a basic level, metrics should provide a quantitative and objective measure of quality at the manufacturing site, and provide a window at a systems level, to the effectiveness of the oversight and control of operations at a given site.","Biotechnology"

"Medical News Today: Notion of 'healthy obesity' further challenged","The existence of 'healthy obesity' has been questioned by health professionals and scientists. A new study provides further evidence against the condition.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312400.php","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Obesity / Weight Loss / Fitness","Notion of 'healthy obesity' further challengedObesity is one of the most visible, yet most neglected public health problems, with an escalating global epidemic of overweight and obesity reaching many parts of the world.

Around 600 million people worldwide are affected by obesity, with the condition significantly increasing the risk of heart disease, stroke, type 2 diabetes, osteoarthritis and some cancers.

Evidence supporting the link between obesity and metabolic and cardiovascular diseases has accumulated since the 1940s. However, experts began to question in the 1970s and 80s the extent to which obesity increases the risk for these disorders.

Furthermore, studies in the late 90s and early 2000s found that not all obese individuals experienced a greater risk of metabolic and cardiovascular complications, and, in fact, they displayed a relatively healthy metabolic and cardiovascular profile, hence the term ""metabolically healthy obesity.""

While no universally accepted criteria exist to define metabolically healthy obesity, a potential hallmark of the condition is a high sensitivity to insulin, a hormone that promotes uptake of blood glucose into cells to be used for energy.

Estimates suggest that up to 30 percent of obese individuals are metabolically healthy and, as a result, may not need as much intervention to prevent obesity-related complications.

Mikael Ryd n, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and colleagues examined the responses to insulin in 15 healthy participants and 50 obese subjects who were enrolled in a gastric bypass surgery clinical study.

Biopsies of abdominal white fat tissue were obtained at the start and end of a 2-hour period of insulin and glucose received by intravenous infusion. Based on the glucose uptake rate, 21 obese individuals were classified as insulin sensitive, and 29 classed as insulin resistant.

Analysis of white fat tissue samples revealed a clear difference between healthy participants and insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant obese individuals.

In response to insulin stimulation, white fat tissue from both obese groups showed almost identical abnormal patterns of gene expression, which were not influenced by cardiovascular or metabolic risk factors such as waist-to-hip ratio, heart rate, or blood pressure.

The researchers uncover that obesity - rather than other common risk factors - is likely the principle factor affecting metabolic health.

""Our study suggests that the notion of metabolically healthy obesity may be more complicated than previously thought, at least in subcutaneous adipose tissue,"" says Ryd n.

""There doesn't appear to be a clear transcriptomic fingerprint that differentiates obese subjects with high or low insulin sensitivity, indicating that obesity per se is the major driver explaining the changes in gene expression,"" he adds.

Study limitations include that gene expression profiles were only examined in white fat tissue and not other types of fatty tissue or other organs. Also, all obese participants were due to go through bariatric surgery, suggesting the finding may only apply to obese individuals at the severe end of the scale.

Overall, the study finds that white fat tissue samples from obese individuals classified as either metabolically healthy or unhealthy show almost identical, abnormal changes in gene expression in response to insulin stimulation.

""Insulin-sensitive obese individuals may not be as metabolically healthy as previously believed,"" says Ryd n. ""Therefore, more vigorous interventions may be necessary in these individuals to prevent cardiovascular and metabolic complications,"" he concludes.

Future studies by the team will concentrate on tracking study participants after bariatric surgery to determine whether the associated weight loss normalizes gene expression responses to insulin. Additionally, Ryd n and his collaborators will investigate particular genes linked to improved metabolic health in these people.

"Medical News Today: Anemia may raise risk of death for stroke patients","Stroke patients who have anemia or whose hemoglobin levels are too high may be at greater risk of death in the year after stroke, study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312399.php","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Stroke","Anemia may raise risk of death for stroke patientsStroke affects more than 795,000 Americans each year, and it is a leading cause of long-term disability in the United States.

Around 87 percent of all strokes are ischemic, whereby the artery that supplies oxygen-rich blood to the brain becomes blocked. When an artery in the brain leaks or ruptures, this is known as hemorrhagic stroke.

According to the research team - including senior author Dr. Phyo Myint of the University of Aberdeen in the United Kingdom - many patients who have experienced stroke have anemia.

Anemia is a condition characterized by low levels of circulating red blood cells or hemoglobin, which causes a reduction in the amount of oxygen that is transported to the body's organs and tissues.

Signs and symptoms of anemia include fatigue, headache, pale skin, dizziness, shortness of breath, coldness in the hands and feet, and chest pain.

While anemia can affect any age group, pregnant women and older adults are at increased risk for the condition.

For their study, Dr. Myint and colleagues set out to investigate how anemia may impact risk of death following stroke.

The researchers analyzed the data of 8,013 adults of an average age of 77, all of whom had been admitted to the hospital with acute stroke between 2003-2015.

The team looked at how participants' levels of hemoglobin - a protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen - and incidence of anemia influenced their risk of death in the year after their stroke.

On hospital admission for stroke, the researchers found that around 25 percent of patients had anemia, and this increased their risk of death over the following year.

Among patients who had ischemic stroke, the risk of death was increased twofold for those with anemia, compared with ischemic stroke patients who did not have anemia. Hemorrhagic stroke patients who had anemia were at 1.5 times greater risk of death.

Furthermore, the researchers found that higher hemoglobin levels among patients were associated with poorer stroke outcomes and increased risk of death, particularly in the first month after stroke.

This finding, the team says, suggests that both low and high hemoglobin levels may raise stroke patients' risk of death.

The researchers' findings were further confirmed with a systematic review of 20 studies - involving almost 30,000 patients - that looked at the link between anemia and stroke outcomes.

Overall, the authors say their research highlights the importance of anemia prevention, diagnosis, and treatment for stroke patients.

""One example of an intervention might be treating the underlying causes of anemia, such as iron deficiency, which is common in this age group,"" says co-author Raphae Barlas, also of the University of Aberdeen.

"Medical News Today: ADHD associated with unhealthy diet in pregnancy","Children with early-onset conduct problems may be more likely to develop ADHD symptoms if their mother had an unhealthy diet during pregnancy, study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312411.php","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","ADHD / ADD","ADHD associated with unhealthy diet in pregnancyStudy co-author Dr. Edward Barker, of King's College London in the United Kingdom, and colleagues publish their findings in the Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry.

According to Mental Health America, conduct disorder is a ""repetitive and persistent pattern of behavior in children and adolescents in which the rights of others or basic social rules are violated.""

Behavior may be aggressive, such as threatening or harming other people or animals, or nonaggressive, such as causing deliberate damage to the property of others.

Children or teenagers with conduct disorder may also engage in deceitful behavior - such as lying and theft - and skipping school, staying out past curfew, and other rule violations are common.

Dr. Barker and colleagues note that conduct disorder often co-occurs alongside attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and research has suggested that such co-occurrence arises from a more serious heritable factor than either condition alone.

Previous studies have linked an unhealthy diet in early life with both conduct disorder and ADHD, which researchers speculate is caused by DNA methylation of the insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) gene. DNA methylation is an epigenetic process by which methyl groups are added to DNA, altering gene function.

IGF2 is involved in fetal development, as well as the development of brain areas involved in ADHD. As such, Dr. Barker and colleagues hypothesized that an unhealthy diet during pregnancy might affect this gene in a way that puts offspring at risk for behavioral problems.

To assess this possible association, the team analyzed data of 164 children and their mothers who were part of the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children - also known as the ""Children of the 90s"" project.

Of these children, 83 had early-onset conduct disorder, while 81 had low levels of conduct problems.

The researchers assessed mothers' diets during pregnancy, as well as blood samples from their children - taken at birth and the age of 7 years - in order to determine whether prenatal diet affects IGF2.

Among both groups of children, those whose mothers had a diet high in fat and sugar during pregnancy showed higher DNA methylation of IGF2 at birth, compared with children whose mothers had a healthy diet in pregnancy.

Importantly, higher IGF2 methylation at birth among children with early-onset conduct disorder was linked to more symptoms of ADHD between the ages of 7-13 years.

Dr. Barker says this study ""highlights the critical importance of a healthy diet during pregnancy.""

The team now plans to investigate how specific nutrition groups affect neural development, in order to better pinpoint the best foods for expectant mothers to consume to lower their offspring's risk of ADHD.

""We already know that nutritional supplements for children can lead to lower ADHD and conduct problems, so it will be important for future research to examine the role of epigenetic changes in this process,"" adds Dr. Barker.

"Medical News Today: How to Deal with a Sebaceous Cyst","Learn all about sebaceous cysts, a type of fluid-filled bump on the skin. This article looks at the appearance, causes, and treatment of sebaceous cysts.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312361.php","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Dermatology","How to Deal with a Sebaceous CystSkin lesions described as sebaceous cysts are not usually, in fact, sebaceous cysts at all.

These skin problems are often epidermoid or pilar cysts. Simply talking about a ""skin cyst"" for both these types may be the best solution. Another term for skin cyst is cutaneous cyst.

Skin cysts are slightly hardened, fluid-filled bumps known as sacs within the skin. The advice on how to deal with one is mainly to avoid worsening the problem. Doctors can treat a bad skin cyst.

There are three common types of skin cyst:

Other types of fluid-filled sac can cause problems. These include boils and abscesses. Cysts are different problems. Cysts tend not to be as big or painful as boils and abscesses.

A skin cyst is a nodule - a dome-shaped, raised area on the skin. Sometimes these cysts have a point at the top called a punctum, which may be a black spot.

The raised bump of a cyst feels harder than normal skin. The cyst and the area of skin around it can be moved like normal skin. This is because cysts are not fixed to anything deeper or below the skin.

A lump that is fixed and cannot be moved around needs to be seen by a doctor.

A skin cyst is usually flesh-colored, but could have slight whitening or yellowing to it.

If it has become infected, a cyst may look red due to inflammation. Infected cysts can also look red with a more visible white appearance, from the infected pus pushing up.

Skin cysts look similar whether they are lined with skin surface cells or lined with root hair cells.

Most range from pea-sized, at about 1 centimeter across, to around 5 centimeters across.

Pilar skin cysts, lined with root hair cells, are almost always on the scalp of the head.

Epidermoid skin cysts are typically found on the face, neck, and upper trunk, or around the genitals.

Tiny epidermoid cysts are often seen on the faces of very young babies. These much smaller cysts are known as milia. They clearly have a pearly white appearance. These facial cysts are filled with the same substance as adult skin cysts.

Skin cysts do not usually cause any troublesome symptoms beyond the effect of their annoying appearance and unattractive contents.

Skin cysts are not usually tender, but their presence can be obvious to the touch. Cysts on the scalp might catch on a brush or comb, for example.

Cysts are only likely to give pain if they get inflamed or infected. Infections sometimes occur because the cyst has burst. If a cyst becomes infected, it may be more of a painful problem in some parts of the skin than others.

Both epidermoid and pilar cysts are filled with a substance that is like toothpaste in consistency, and cheesy and smelly.

However, the substance is not - except for complicated cysts - infected by microbes like bacteria. The pus smells worse when it is infected.

Uninfected contents are made up of keratin, the protein responsible for giving strength to the top layer of skin

True sebaceous cysts, which are not seen as often as the skin cysts above, contain a greasy substance. These contents are the oil that comes from sebaceous glands surrounding the base of normal hairs.

The hair base units in the skin are what go wrong when acne occurs. Acne develops when oil gets ""plugged in"" by pimples. Severe forms of this are not as common, but they can cause cysts.

Epidermoid and pilar skin cysts are different from the cysts that can develop in severe acne.

How skin cysts form is easier to answer than why. The way skin cysts form is by multiplying cells moving inward, rather than moving to the surface and shedding away as skin cells normally do.

The skin is made up of two layers. The top layer is the epidermis, and the outermost of this is where skin cells eventually push up dead and shed away. Underneath the epidermis is the dermis layer.

Epidermoid cysts are when cells from the upper surface layer form a sac down in the lower layer.

Why skin cysts form is not fully known by medical science. In some cases, there is a link to genetics. Gardner's syndrome, for example, is a genetic disorder linked with lots of skin cysts, along with other types of growth. Pilar cysts linked with hairs on the head may have an inherited tendency.

Skin cysts can sometimes form because of damage that causes top-layer cells to be ""implanted"" in the lower layer.

While skin cysts can look bad, doing anything to them can make them worse:

Picking, rubbing, or squeezing at cysts is likely to cause damage and make any infection worse. It is also likely to make any pain and appearance worse.

Dealing with skin cysts that are causing concern or producing symptoms means getting them seen by a doctor. Doctors can help make sure of the correct diagnosis and deal with any other concerns. They can also treat a troublesome cyst without making it worse.

The only appropriate home treatment for cysts is to keep infected ones clean. These should also be seen by a doctor. After a doctor has removed a plain cyst that was causing problems, the area should also be kept clean.

People can keep a cyst clean at home by using a clean cloth, cotton wool, or medical dressing material. This should be used to help bathe the cyst gently with clean, warm water, and then to dab it dry.

If a cyst is not causing any trouble, there is no good reason for a doctor to intervene.

A doctor may remove a cyst if it is causing problems. This might be because of infection, because the cyst gets in the way of normal actions, or because it is particularly bad to look at due to size or location.

If a cyst has burst or there is an infection under the skin, the doctor may need to lance and drain it. A course of antibiotics may also need to be taken.

Tiny cysts can also be treated by lancing and draining them.

Doctors removing a cyst will aim to remove it completely. If part of the sac wall is left behind, the cyst may form again.

Removing a cyst can leave a small scar. Cysts that do not cause any problem can safely be left alone without treatment.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Dementia risk increased with calcium supplements in certain women","In seniors who have experienced cerebrovascular disease, including stroke, calcium supplements may increase the risk of dementia, study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312371.php","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Alzheimer's / Dementia","Dementia risk increased with calcium supplements in certain womenCerebrovascular diseases are conditions caused by problems that affect the blood supply to the brain. The four most common types of cerebrovascular disease are stroke, transient ischemic attack (TIA), subarachnoid hemorrhage, and vascular dementia.

These diseases are the fifth leading cause of death in the United States and increase the risk of developing dementia.

""Osteoporosis is a common problem in the elderly. Because calcium deficiency contributes to osteoporosis, daily calcium intake of 1,000 to 1,200 mg is recommended. Getting this recommended amount through diet alone can be difficult, so calcium supplements are widely used,"" says study author Silke Kern, M.D., Ph.D. with the University of Gothenburg in Sweden.

""Recently, however, the use of supplements and their effect on health has been questioned,"" she adds.

The researchers hypothesized that calcium supplementation is associated with an increased risk of dementia, and this association is heightened in individuals already compromised by ischemic cerebrovascular disease.

The team tested their theory using a population of elderly women initially free from dementia. A total of 700 women between the ages of 70-92 were involved in the analysis and were followed for 5 years.

Participants received tests of memory and thinking skills at the beginning and end of the study, and a CT brain scan was performed on 447 participants at the start of the research.

Also examined, was the use of calcium supplements by participants, and whether they received a diagnosis of dementia over the duration of the study.

At the beginning of the investigation, a total of 98 women were taking calcium supplements. History of stroke was noted in 54 individuals at the start of the study, and 54 more women experienced stroke, while 59 women developed dementia by the study follow-up.

Of the women who received CT scans, 71 percent had lesions in the white matter - a marker for cerebrovascular disease - of their brain.

Results of the study showed that when compared with women who do not take calcium supplements, women who take calcium supplements are twice as likely to develop dementia. However, the increased risk was only observed in women with cerebrovascular disease.

Moreover, women with a history of stroke who also took calcium supplements were seven times more likely to develop dementia than women with a history of stroke who did not supplement calcium.

The participants who had white matter lesions and took calcium supplements had a three-times increased risk of developing dementia, compared with women with white matter lesions and no calcium supplementation.

Women without a history of stroke and women without white matter lesions had no greater risk of dementia when taking calcium supplements.

Overall, out of the 98 women who supplemented with calcium, 14 of them (14 percent) developed dementia, compared with 45 out of 602 women (8 percent) who did not take calcium supplements.

Of the women with a history of stroke who took calcium supplements, six out of 15 of them developed dementia, compared with 12 out of 93 women with a history of stroke who did not take supplements.

Among the 83 women who took calcium supplements with no history of stroke, 18 of them developed dementia, compared with 33 out of the 509 who did not take supplements.

Kern also cautioned that the small nature of the study means that the results cannot be generalized to the overall population; therefore, additional studies need to be conducted to confirm the findings.

Although these findings have been observed in calcium supplements, calcium from foods affects the body differently to calcium supplements and is suggested to be safe and even protective against vascular problems, Kern concludes.

"Medical News Today: New opioid as effective as morphine, without the side effects","Researchers have identified a drug candidate that is as effective as morphine for relieving pain, but without the harmful side effects of opioids.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312393.php","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Pain / Anesthetics","New opioid as effective as morphine, without the side effectsIn a study published in the journal Nature, researchers reveal how they deciphered the atomic structure of the ""morphine receptor"" in the brain to create a drug compound that blocks pain just as well as morphine, but without the harmful side effects that can lead to patient death.

What is more, the team says - unlike current opioids - the compound does not activate the brain's reward region, so it has the potential to reduce addiction.

Opioids are used for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. They work by attaching to proteins called opioid receptors, which reduces the perception of pain.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), between 1999-2014, sales of prescription opioids in the U.S. almost quadrupled. However, during the same period, there was no increase in the amount of pain reported by Americans.

Alongside the soar in opioid prescription sales came a similar increase in prescription opioid deaths; between 2000-2014, the drugs were responsible for almost half a million deaths in the U.S.

This has caused much concern among healthcare professionals, and earlier this year, the CDC issued new prescription guidelines to help tackle what has been referred to as the ""opioid epidemic.""

But could this new study offer a way to tackle this epidemic at its root?

Despite the harms associated with opioids, there is no doubt the drugs offer significant benefits for many patients with moderate to severe pain.

""Morphine transformed medicine,"" notes co-senior author Brian Shoichet, Ph.D., a professor of pharmaceutical chemistry in the School of Pharmacy at the University of California-San Francisco (UCSF).

""There are so many medical procedures we can do now because we know we can control the pain afterwards. But it's obviously dangerous too. People have been searching for a safer replacement for standard opioids for decades,"" he adds.

According to Shoichet, scientists have previously tried to alter the structure of morphine itself in an attempt to abolish its harmful side effects, while maintaining its pain-relieving effects.

Rather than trying to change the structure of morphine, the researchers of the new study looked at how they could develop a new opioid from scratch by using information about the structure of the brain's morphine receptor - the mu-opioid receptor.

Co-senior author Dr. Brian Koblika, of Stanford University School of Medicine, deciphered the atomic structure of this receptor back in 2012.

""With traditional forms of drug discovery, you're locked into a little chemical box,"" says Shoichet. ""But when you start with the structure of the receptor you want to target, you can throw all those constraints away. You're empowered to imagine all sorts of things that you couldn't even think about before.""

For their study, the researchers combined the structural information of the mu-opioid receptor with a computational technique called ""molecular docking.""

This allowed the team to conduct around 4 trillion ""virtual experiments,"" simulating how more than 3 million molecules might fit to the structure of the mu-opioid receptor and activate it.

Specifically, the researchers searched for molecules that bind to the receptor and activate G-protein signaling to reduce pain perception, but that do not activate beta-arrestin2 - a protein that is responsible for respiratory problems and constipation associated with opioid use.

The researchers pinpointed 23 molecules that showed promise, and by increasing the chemical efficacy of these molecules 1000-fold, they found the most effective candidate was once they call PZM21.

Next, the researchers tested PZM21 in lab experiments and mouse models. They found the molecule was able to target the mu-opioid receptor to reduce pain signaling just as effectively as morphine, but it did not trigger breathing problems and constipation.

They also found the molecule primarily targeted opioid circuits in the brain to relieve pain, with little impact on the opioid receptors in the spinal cord. According to the team, no other opioid has such specificity.

Furthermore, mouse experiments revealed PZM21 did not stimulate the dopamine pathways in the brain, which are reward systems known to fuel addiction.

In behavioral experiments, the team found that mice did not increase their time spent in chambers where they had received PZM21 previously; this would not have been the case if the mice were addicted to the drug.

""We haven't shown this is truly non-addictive,"" notes Shoichet. ""At this point we've just shown that mice don't appear motivated to seek out the drug.""

While further research is needed to establish the safety and efficacy of PZM21 in humans, as well as whether it could curb addiction, the researchers believe they are well on the way to developing a drug that could fight the opioid epidemic.

"Medical News Today: Slower blood aging may explain why Hispanics live longer","Hispanics live longer than other ethnicities despite having higher rates of disease. New research finds this may be because they have slower blood aging.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312374.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Seniors / Aging","Slower blood aging may explain why Hispanics live longerLead author Steve Horvath, a professor of human genetics at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA), and colleagues publish their findings in the journal Genome Biology.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Hispanic population in the United States has an average life expectancy of 81.6 years.

In comparison, non-Hispanic white Americans have an average life expectancy of 78.8 years, while black Americans and non-Hispanic black Americans have life expectancies of 75.3 and 74.9 years, respectively.

Interestingly, while Hispanic Americans have a longer lifespan than individuals of other ethnicities, they have higher rates of disease; for example, the rate of diagnosed diabetes among Hispanics is 12.8 percent, compared with 7.6 percent among non-Hispanic whites.

This has long baffled researchers, who often refer to the longer lifespan of Hispanics as the ""Hispanic paradox.""

Now, the study from Horvath and colleagues may help explain why higher disease rates do not appear to hinder Hispanics' longevity.

According to the team, no previous studies have estimated and compared molecular aging rates among different genders or racial/ethnic groups using epigenetic measures.

Epigenetics refers to heritable alterations to gene expression - through external or environmental factors - that do not involve changes to the underlying sequence of DNA.

For their study, the researchers analyzed the DNA in blood, saliva, and brain samples of almost 6,000 individuals from seven different ethnic groups. These included Hispanics, African-Americans, non-Hispanic whites, and Tsimane - an indigenous population of lowland Bolivia who are genetically related to Hispanics.

The team used a number of biomarkers when assessing participants' DNA, including an ""epigenetic clock"" - created by Horvath 3 years ago - that monitors epigenetic changes in the genome related to aging.

On analyzing the DNA in blood samples of participants, the researchers identified significant differences between ethnic groups.

Specifically, they found that cells in the blood of Hispanic and Tsimane populations aged more slowly than those of other ethnic groups.

The researchers believe epigenetics may explain why Hispanics have a longer lifespan, despite having higher rates of certain diseases.

Supporting their hypothesis, they point out that the biological age of postmenopausal Hispanic women - estimated using the epigenetic clock - was found to be around 2.4 years younger than that of postmenopausal women of the same chronological age.

Blood aging was slowest among the Tsimane population, the team reports; the age of their blood was around 2 years younger than Hispanics' blood and around 4 years younger than the blood of non-Hispanic whites.

""Despite frequent infections, the Tsimane people show very little evidence of the chronic diseases that commonly afflict modern society,"" notes study co-author Michael Gurven, a professor of anthropology at the University of California-Santa Barbara. ""Our findings provide an interesting molecular explanation for their robust health.""

While these findings may be good news for Hispanic and Tsimane populations, individuals of other ethnicities should not be disheartened; the team says the results could one day lead to a better understanding of ways to slow the aging process for all ethnic groups.

On assessing the results by gender, the researchers also found that the brain tissue of men ages faster than that of women. This, they say, may explain why women have a longer lifespan than men.

The team now plans to analyze other human tissues in order to establish their aging rate, and they also want to pinpoint the molecular mechanisms by which Hispanics have a slower aging rate.

Both can cause significant distress and are known to complicate and worsen other physical diseases.

Globally, some estimate that 1 in 10 adults are diagnosed with chronic pain each year.

Despite these high numbers, the risk factors involved are still shrouded in mystery, although genetics and environmental factors are both known to play their part.

A recent study found that chronic pain has a heritability of 30 percent.

Other genetic studies, including a number of twin studies, have come to similar conclusions; genes are increasingly considered to be heavily involved in the development of chronic pain.

Depression, which is estimated to impact 15.7 million adults aged 18 or older in the United States each year, also has a genetic component. The influence of genes appears to be of the same order as chronic pain. For instance, one study estimated the heritability of major depressive disorder to be 37 percent.

Although a genetic component to both conditions seems clear, the way in which genes conspire to create chronic pain and depression is not understood. To further muddy the waters, environmental factors, such as lifestyle and sleep quality, are also known to play their part.

The exact interplay between genes and environment has always been a difficult problem to solve.

Researchers from the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom set out to investigate genetic and environmental influences on depression and chronic pain. They used data from two large nationwide studies - Generation Scotland and UK Biobank projects.

Both projects were designed to understand the genetic factors behind health conditions. For the current study, more than 100,000 participants' data were examined.

Each of the individuals' genetic backgrounds were delved into, as were their experiences of depression and pain.

The team found that partners of people with depression were more likely to experience chronic pain, but a person's genetic make-up also played its part.

Overall, heritability was found to account for 38.4 percent of the variation in chronic pain risk; also, a shared environment with spouses or partners accounted for 18.7 percent of the variation in susceptibility to chronic pain.

Additionally, there were unidentified risk factors that were shared by partners or spouses. It became clear that the risk factors for chronic pain and depression had a significant overlap; the authors conclude that ""the cumulative effects of genetic risk factors for depression increased an individual's chance of having chronic pain.""

These findings, published this week in PLOS Medicine, might lead the way toward more effective treatments in the future. Chronic pain, in particular, is a common cause of disability, but very little is known about its causes.

The results of the study show that both genetic factors and chronic pain in a spouse or partner increase the risk of chronic pain for the individual. The authors also conclude that chronic pain is caused by an accumulation of a number of small genetic effects and is associated with some of the same environmental and genetic risk factors that increase the risk of depression.

In short, the two conditions are deeply entwined. Genes play a large part, as does the environment. The more we learn about the interaction, the easier it will be to find effective treatments for the conditions and, perhaps, understand how to prevent them from occurring.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Pregnancy: Antipsychotic use does not increase the risk of birth defects","Exposure to antipsychotic drugs during the first trimester of pregnancy is not associated with an increased risk of congenital or cardiac malformations.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312370.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Mental Health","Pregnancy: Antipsychotic use does not increase the risk of birth defectsThe average number of drugs (over the counter or prescribed, excluding vitamins and minerals) used anytime during pregnancy increased from 2.5 in 1976-1978 to 4.2 in 2006-2008.

In 2008, nearly 94 percent of women took at least one medication during pregnancy; in the first trimester, 82.3 percent used at least one, and 27.6 percent reported taking four or more medications.

These statistics highlight the public health importance of research to inform pharmacotherapy for pregnant women.

Exposure to antipsychotics (APs) during pregnancy is increasingly common. APs are a range of medications that are used for some types of mental distress or disorder - such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorders - or used with antidepressants to treat depression.

There are two different groups of antipsychotics. The first type is titled ""typical"" - an older type of drug that first appeared in the mid-1950s. They block the action of dopamine, some more strongly than others.

""Atypical"" antipsychotics - newer medications that were approved in the 1990s - still block dopamine, but on a smaller scale. They also work on different chemical messengers in the brain such as serotonin.

The new atypical drugs have a decreased risk of affecting fertility when compared with their older typical counterparts. When combined with the deinstitutionalization of psychiatric patients, these factors are attributed to doubling the use of APs during pregnancy in the past decade.

Clinicians understand very little regarding the safety of APs on the developing fetus, and concerns have been raised about a potential association between APs and congenital malformations.

The study, published in JAMA Psychiatry, examined the risk of congenital and cardiac malformations associated with first-trimester exposure to APs.

Krista F.G. Huybrechts, M.S., Ph.D., an associate epidemiologist in the Division of Pharmacoepidemiology and Pharmacoeconomics at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School, and co-authors used a nationwide Medicaid database sample of 1,341,715 pregnant women enrolled from 3 months before their last menstrual period through at least 1 month after delivery.

Exposure to APs was defined as filling at least one prescription during the first trimester - the first 90 days - of pregnancy. Both typical and atypical antipsychotic medications were evaluated.

Individual drugs including aripiprazole, olanzapine, quetiapine fumarate, risperidone, and ziprasidone were assessed. Women were considered unexposed if they failed to fill an AP prescription during the 3 months before the start of pregnancy or during the first trimester.

According to the results, among the more than 1.3 million women, 9,258 women (0.69 percent) filled a prescription for an atypical AP, and 733 women (0.05 percent) filled a prescription for a typical AP during the first trimester. The most frequently used atypical APs in order of frequency were quetiapine, aripiprazole, risperidone, olanzapine, and ziprasidone.

Huybrechts and team found that 4.45 percent of births exposed to atypical APs and 3.82 percent of births exposed to typical APs were associated with congenital malformations, compared with 3.27 percent of births to women who did not fill a prescription for an AP. Similar findings were noted for cardiac malformations.

With the possible exception of risperidone, the authors observed no significant increased risk of birth defects for typical or atypical APs after accounting for co-existing mental and physical conditions and their associated behaviors.

The authors caution that the small increase in absolute risk and relative risk for birth defects observed with risperidone should be interpreted with caution because no clear biological mechanism can readily explain this outcome, and the possibility of a chance finding cannot be ruled out.

""The findings for risperidone should be viewed as an initial safety signal that will require confirmation in other studies,"" the study concludes.

Katherine L. Wisner, M.D., of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, IL, and co-authors write in a related editorial: ""The authors found that associations between AP exposure and birth defects were attenuated after adjustment for confounding, which implies that these variables, rather than AP exposure, account for much of the effect on congenital malformations.""

""This landmark report, with the largest population of women exposed to APs published to date to our knowledge, demonstrates that exposure to APs (other than risperidone) does not significantly increase the risk for birth defects, which has been a major source of concern for women and prescribers,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: What is Hypovolemic Shock? Symptoms and Treatment","Learn all about hypovolemic shock, a severe loss of blood or fluid. This article looks at the causes, symptoms, and treatment of this medical emergency.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312348.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Emergency Medicine","What is Hypovolemic Shock? Symptoms and TreatmentHypovolemic shock is the medical term to indicate that a patient has a decreased amount of blood or blood plasma, resulting in further complications.

There is more to the condition than just a lack of blood from bleeding or drop in sodium levels in the body. In fact, hypovolemic shock occurs for a number of reasons.

As it is linked to blood loss, the cause of hypovolemic shock may be difficult to diagnose. It is even more difficult to prevent.

For an overview of hypovolemic shock, it is important to look at the stages of the condition as it appears.

A person with the earliest stage of hypovolemic shock will have lost up to 15 percent of their blood. This loss can be difficult to diagnose. Blood pressure and breathing will be generally normal.

The most noticeable symptom at this stage is that the skin will begin to look pale. The person may also be experiencing anxiety.

In the second stage, the blood loss increases to up to 30 percent. The patient may experience increased heart and breathing rates.

Their blood pressure may still be within normal range. The diastolic reading, or bottom number, of their blood pressure reading may be raised, however. The patient may begin sweating and feel more anxious and restless.

By stage 3, the person with hypovolemic shock will have had 30 to 40 percent blood loss. The top number or systolic reading of their blood pressure will be 100 or lower. They will have a significantly increased heart rate and abnormally rapid breathing.

The patient will begin to experience mental distress, including anxiety and agitation. Their skin will be pale and cold, and they will begin sweating.

A person with shock from blood loss at stage 4 will be in real danger. They will have experienced a loss of blood volume greater than 40 percent. They will have a weak pulse but rapid heart rate.

Breathing will be extremely difficult. Their blood pressure readings will be under 70 for the top number. They may be in and out of consciousness, sweaty, cool to the touch, and extremely pale.

The obvious cause of hypovolemic shock is blood loss, but that isn't all of it. The loss of blood can come from external or internal bleeding due to illness or injury. Most of the time, hypovolemic shock will be a complication of another condition.

It is also possible for blood levels to drop when the body loses other fluids. Burns, diarrhea, and vomiting can all be potential causes.

Medical professionals and first responders are trained to recognize the signs of blood loss. However, it is also helpful for people to be aware of the possibility for themselves and others so that they can get help as quickly as possible.

Since this type of shock occurs from either illness or injury, it is difficult to determine risk factors. Anyone is potentially at risk for developing this condition, though it is relatively rare.

Dehydration may be a contributing factor in some cases of hypovolemic shock. Continuing to drink water is very important, especially during illnesses where vomiting or diarrhea may occur.

While a person can't always control an injury or illnesses that may cause hypovolemic shock, they can try to prevent further complications by rehydrating.

The easiest way for a medical professional to diagnose hypovolemic shock is by observation. A physical exam will show whether or not the person has low blood pressure, increased heart and breathing rates, and a low body temperature.

There are some tests that can also help make this tricky diagnosis. A blood chemistry test can give some additional clues, along with a complete blood count, also called a CBC.

The following tests can also help determine the condition and underlying cause:

The treatment for the hypovolemic shock itself, which is typically caused by another condition, can be as tricky as diagnosing it. The most common treatments are:

The hospital or doctor will need to get the shock under control to treat the underlying illness or injury.

Hypovolemic shock is an emergency medical situation that is a symptom of an underlying cause. The outlook will have more to do with the long-term implications of that situation than the shock itself.

If the shock itself can be brought under control, the outlook of the injury or illness will be the main factor for the well-being of the person with the condition. Otherwise, the outlook can depend on:

As with many conditions, hypovolemic shock is of specific concern in older adults. Because age has an impact on the body's circulatory system, any stress caused by loss of blood and the other symptoms of the shock can lead to further damage.

Blood loss of this level can also contribute to heart failure or stroke.

Older patients need to have access to emergency care as soon as symptoms are noticed.

As hypovolemic shock is usually a symptom of another emergency situation, the most important thing is to seek treatment right away. It is also important to understand that treating the shock itself won't be preventive, but it can lead to further diagnoses and treatments that can be life-saving.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Obesity-related cancer risk increased by overweight duration","A longer duration of overweight and obesity in adulthood is associated with increased risk of several cancers, including breast and endometrial cancers.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312364.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Cancer / Oncology","Obesity-related cancer risk increased by overweight durationHigh body mass index (BMI) has become the leading risk factor of disease burden in high-income countries.

Worldwide, at least 2.8 million people die each year as a result of being overweight or obese. An estimated 35.8 million (2.3 percent) of global disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) - the sum of years of potential life lost due to premature mortality and the years of productive life lost due to disability - are caused by overweight or obesity.

Recent studies have suggested that the risk of cancer related to obesity is accelerated by time. The aim of the new study was to assess the impact of adulthood overweight and obesity duration on the risk of cancer.

The study was led by Melina Arnold, of the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) - the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO), in Lyon, France - and Prof. Hoda Anton-Culver, of the University of California-Irvine.

The researchers used data from the United States Women's Health Initiative (WHI). They planned to identify dose-response relationships between duration of high BMI and the risk of developing several types of cancer.

The authors note that to date, most studies that have explored the relationship between excess weight and cancer risk have observed cross-sectional exposure information - such as height and weight measured at one point in time - on overweight and obesity.

Using multiple BMI measurements over time, the team examined data from a total of 73,913 postmenopausal women. Around two thirds of the included women were overweight or obese, and 6,301 obesity-related cancers were diagnosed during a mean follow-up of 12.6 years.

Arnold and colleagues explored how the timing, duration, and intensity of overweight and obesity impacts on cancer risk, taking into account other factors related to obesity, such as physical activity, diet, smoking, hormone use, and history of diabetes.

Out of all included study participants, 40 percent were never overweight, and 60 percent were overweight for some time during their adult life, almost half of whom were also obese at some point.

The study found that being overweight for a longer duration as an adult significantly increased the incidence of all obesity-related cancers by 7 percent for every 10-year increase in overweight adulthood period. An increase in risk was also seen for postmenopausal breast cancer, by 5 percent, and endometrial cancer, by 17 percent.

After adjusting for the intensity of overweight - how overweight individuals were - these figures rose to 8 percent for postmenopausal breast cancer and 37 percent for endometrial cancer for every 10 years spent with BMI ten units above normal weight.

The findings highlight that the duration a woman spends overweight, and how overweight they are, play important roles in their risk of cancer, which emphasizes the importance of obesity prevention at all ages from early onset.

The authors write: ""We found that longer durations of overweight and obesity were significantly associated with an increased incidence of obesity-related cancers, postmenopausal breast cancer, and colon, endometrial, and kidney cancer.""

Arnold and team note that although the observational nature of the study prevents them reaching a conclusion about cause and effect, or making clinical recommendations, the findings suggest that reducing overweight duration in adulthood could reduce cancer risk.

""If this is true, healthcare teams should recognize the potential of obesity management in cancer prevention and that excess body weight in women is important to manage regardless of the age of the patient,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: Alzheimer's-causing proteins could be reduced with a healthy diet, exercise","A healthy diet, a healthy BMI, and regular physical activity could reduce the buildup of proteins associated with Alzheimer's disease, a new study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312367.php","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Alzheimer's / Dementia","Alzheimer's-causing proteins could be reduced with a healthy diet, exercisePublished in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, the study found people with mild memory problems who followed a Mediterranean diet, engaged in regular physical activity, or who had a normal body mass index (BMI) were less likely to experience a buildup of beta-amyloid and tau proteins in the brain.

Accumulation of beta-amyloid and tau are hallmarks of Alzheimer's; beta-amyloid clumps together, forming plaques between nerve cells that impair signaling, while tau forms tangles that can damage nerve cells.

The research - led by Dr. David Merrill of the University of California-Los Angeles (UCLA) - comes only days after Medical News Today reported on another study hailing the benefits of a Mediterranean diet against Alzheimer's, providing further evidence that lifestyle factors play an important role in the disease.

However, Dr. Merrill and colleagues say their study is the first to show how such factors affect the buildup of Alzheimer's-related proteins in the brains of individuals with mild memory complaints.

""The fact that we could detect this influence of lifestyle at a molecular level before the beginning of serious memory problems surprised us,"" says Dr. Merrill.

For their study, the team enrolled 44 adults aged 40-85. Of these, 24 had subjective memory impairment and 20 had mild cognitive impairment (MCI), but none of the participants had been diagnosed with dementia.

Subjective memory impairment is where an individual believes they are having problems with memory, while MCI is where memory problems are observed by the individual experiencing them and other people.

Participants self-reported their BMI, physical activity levels, and the extent to which they followed a Mediterranean diet.

Considered the ""heart-healthy"" diet, the Mediterranean diet is typically high in plant-based foods - such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains - and low in red meat. It also involves switching butter for healthy fats - such as olive oil - consuming fish and poultry at least twice weekly, and drinking red wine in moderation.

All study participants underwent a novel type of PET scan known as FDDNP-PET, which measures levels of beta-amyloid plaques and tau tangles in the brain.

The team found that subjects who had a healthy BMI, followed a Mediterranean diet, and who engaged in regular physical activity had lower levels of plaques and tangles in their brains than subjects who did not adhere to such lifestyle factors.

These results, say the authors, highlight the importance of a healthy lifestyle for a healthy brain in later life.

"Medical News Today: Celiac disease: Season, region of birth linked with increased risk in children","Season and region of birth may be associated with an increased risk of celiac disease in children before the age of 15, study finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312353.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Immune System / Vaccines","Celiac disease: Season, region of birth linked with increased risk in childrenCeliac disease (CD) is an autoimmune condition whereby the immune system - the body's defense against infection - mistakenly attacks healthy tissue. The immune system mistakes the substances found in gluten as a threat to the body and attacks them. CD is not an allergy or intolerance to gluten.

Prevalence of CD is estimated at around 1 in 100 people worldwide and affects at least 3 million Americans. CD incidence is increasing globally, which suggests environmental factors may play a role in the cause of the disease.

The objective of the Swedish study was to explore the effects of season of birth on the risk of CD, and compare different areas and time periods to suggest environmental factors that may be associated with CD seasonality.

The research team accessed a long-term study of almost 2 million children up to the age of 15 who were born in Sweden between 1991-2009. A total of 6,569 of the children were diagnosed with CD from 47 pediatric departments across the country.

Fredinah Namatovu, senior research assistant at Department of Public Health and Clinical Medicine Epidemiology and Global Health at Ume  University, and colleagues examined the association between CD diagnosis and season, region, and year of birth.

Results from the research, published in the Archives of Disease in Childhood, showed that the risk of CD diagnosis among children born in spring (March-May), summer (June-August), and autumn (September-November) was 10 percent higher than children born in winter (December-February).

However, seasonal patterns differed by region. Children born in the south of Sweden, where there is intense sunlight in spring and summer, experienced the highest risk of CD, followed by central Sweden, with the lowest risk of CD seen among children born in the north of the country, where spring is colder, and the summer is shorter.

Children under the age of 2 years were more likely to develop CD if they were born in spring, and children 2-14.9 years had an increased risk of CD when born in summer and autumn compared with winter.

Birth year was analyzed in three groups to observe any differences in trends: 1991-1996 represented children born during the CD epidemic, 1997-2002 included children born immediately after the epidemic, and 2003-2009 births were after the CD epidemic had subsided.

Children born between 1991-1996 had an increased risk of CD if born during spring, those born in the 1997-2002 group had a higher risk of CD if born in summer and autumn. In the 2003-2009 group, CD risk was greater if born in the fall.

CD risk was higher in girls than boys, regardless of age across all seasons and birth years.

The authors say that while there have been several studies that look at the association between season of birth and CD in Sweden, this is the first Swedish study investigating CD risk while taking into account four seasons and geographical variations.

No firm conclusions can be drawn from the research regarding cause and effect, as the study is observational. Also, one of the limitations of the investigation is the lack of data on infections and vitamin D level, which could be potential influential factors in seasonality and, subsequently, CD risk.

Namatovu and team write: ""One hypothesis for increased CD risk and spring/summer birth is that, those infants are more likely to be weaned and introduced to gluten during autumn/winter, a time characterized by exposure to seasonal viral infections.""

While some studies suggest breast-feeding to be protective against CD through mechanisms such as regulating gut microbiota and, furthermore, its effect on the immune system, recent studies could not confirm breast-feeding's protective effect.

The researchers also suggest that development of CD could be triggered by viral infections that alter intestinal bacteria and increase the permeability of cells lining the gut.

Among Swedish physicians, it is well known that the yearly epidemics of respiratory syncytial virus, rotavirus, and influenza start in southern Sweden and spread northward over a couple of months, which supports some of the associations observed, the authors add.

Another suggested mechanism for seasonal variation of CD risk is vitamin D deficiency due to differences in sunlight and UVB exposure. Low Vitamin D levels during childhood are a risk factor for immune-mediated diseases such as multiple sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and type 1 diabetes.

However, every child is recommended and offered government-funded vitamin D supplementation from 1 week to 2 years of age, to ensure adequate levels.

""A remaining possible link to sunlight and vitamin D is that pregnant women who give birth in spring have the lowest levels of vitamin D during late gestation when important programming and development of the fetal immune system takes place,"" they suggest.

""Whatever exposures are important in explaining seasonality, they have to work in a well-defined period, that is, during early life when the immune system is in an important developmental phase, otherwise there would be no seasonal pattern,"" they conclude.

"Medical News Today: Brain's empathy center identified","Empathy is a high level emotion that helps us navigate the complex social environment we live in. New research may have found its neural home.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312349.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Neurology / Neuroscience","Brain's empathy center identifiedHumans are complex animals living in a complex environment. Every day, our brain makes thousands of decisions, helping us navigate social challenges.

Sometimes we do things to benefit ourselves; other times, we decide to act in a way that benefits others.

Humans evolved to be social animals, and, in social groups, people who only look after themselves cannot thrive within the group. An individual needs to act in a way that allows them to survive, of course, but there also needs to be generosity.

Being generous involves an understanding of the other person's needs; this takes empathy - an ability to put one's self in another's shoes.

Showing empathy and acting upon it is an essential part of being human.

That being said, some individuals - those with psychopathy or other types of personality disorders - do not have this hardwired ability and desire to help others.

Recently, researchers from the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom decided to add to the current understanding of so-called prosocial behaviors and investigate the neurological origin of empathy and generosity.

Dr. Patricia Lockwood published her work this week in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

To study this human trait, the researchers scanned participants using an MRI machine while they carried out tasks. The specific tasks were based on well-used models that test how people learn to benefit themselves. Participants had to work out which symbols they needed to press to bring themselves the biggest reward.

As a twist to the classic experiment, the participants also had to learn which symbols were more likely to give someone else a reward.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, the results showed that people learned to benefit themselves quicker than they learned to help others. Additionally, using the MRI scanner, the team pinpointed the region of the brain that was activated when carrying out actions that helped other people.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) is an area of the brain known to be involved in the control of a number of automatic processes, such as the regulation of blood pressure and heart rate. It is also thought to be important in higher level functions, including reward anticipation, impulse control, decision-making, and emotion.

When the participants were learning how to help others, a specific part of the ACC was activated called the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC); this region was the only area to light up on brain scans, and it was not triggered while learning actions which favored the individual.

This implies that the sgACC is particularly tuned to controlling and monitoring generosity.

Interestingly, the team also found that the sgACC was not equally active in each of the scanned brains. Those who self-reported higher levels of empathy had higher activation levels, whereas individuals who did not activate it so readily, rated themselves as less empathic.

Although previous studies have highlighted certain, overlapping areas of the brain involved in empathy and prosocial behavior, this study adds a new level of specificity.

These findings are interesting in their own right, but they also hold potential for future psychiatric interventions. Because certain mental disorders involve a loss or lack of empathy, knowing which regions of the brain are likely affected could help in the design of more targeted drugs further down the line.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Prolonged sitting: 'Exercise does not offset health risks,' say AHA","A scientific statement from the American Heart Association says physical activity does not counteract the health risks linked to sedentary behavior.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312356.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Sports Medicine / Fitness","Prolonged sitting: 'Exercise does not offset health risks,' say AHAIn recent years, there has been an increasing number of studies documenting the harms of sedentary behavior - defined as any waking activity that involves sitting or lying down, such as watching TV or working on the computer.

Research has repeatedly linked sedentary behavior with increased risk of obesity, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and more.

A study published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine earlier this year estimated that prolonged sitting is responsible for 430,000 all-cause deaths over 54 countries, and a more recent study claimed that sedentary behavior is a leading risk factor for mortality, second only to smoking.

While some studies suggest that physical activity can offset the harms of the prolonged sitting, other research claims that is not the case.

The new statement from the American Heart Association (AHA) - published in the journal Circulation - supports the latter, finding that no matter how much exercise one does, sitting too much is detrimental to health.

Deborah Rohm Young, Ph.D., chair of the AHA statement and director of behavioral research at Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and colleagues reached their findings after conducting a review of the current evidence on sedentary behavior.

Highlighting the fact that Americans spend too long sitting, the review revealed that younger adults in the United States are sedentary for around 6-8 hours a day, while adults aged 60 and older spend around 8.6-9.6 hours a day sedentary.

The authors explain that sedentary behaviors normally have an energy expenditure of 1.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) or less. Slow, leisurely walking or light housework uses around 2.5 METs, while vigorous to moderate physical activity uses around 3 METs or more.

Based on current evidence, Young and colleagues found that spending too much time sitting may raise the risk of impaired insulin sensitivity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and all-cause death.

What is more, the review revealed that these risks are not reduced by moderate to vigorous physical activity, suggesting that prolonged sitting is harmful to health, regardless of how much one exercises.

Young says that, at present, they are unable to pinpoint exactly how long is too long when it comes to sitting, but for now, their advice is to reduce the amount of time spent sedentary and increase the amount of time spent active.

""There's a lot of research that we need to do. This statement is important because it starts the ball rolling and suggests sedentary behavior may play an important role in heart health and more. But, it's too early to make conclusive recommendations other than to encourage Americans to 'sit less, move more.'""

In line with the AHA's physical activity guidelines, the authors recommend engaging in around 30 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity daily; they note that exercising in smaller amounts each day is more beneficial than trying to fit in the same amount of exercise in fewer days.

"Medical News Today: Flu nasal spray just as effective as flu shot","Contrary to previous studies, new research shows that immunizing children with the flu nasal spray provides similar protection to the standard flu shot.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312326.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Flu / Cold / SARS","Flu nasal spray just as effective as flu shotFlu is a contagious respiratory illness caused by influenza viruses. It can cause mild to severe illness, and it can sometimes lead to death.

The most important step in preventing flu is to get a flu vaccination, while everyday preventative actions - such as covering coughs and sneezes and frequent hand-washing - can slow the spread of germs that cause flu.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend a yearly flu vaccine by the end of October for everyone over the age of 6 months. Vaccinating against flu can reduce flu illnesses, prevent flu-related hospitalizations, and protect people both individually and communally from becoming infected, known as herd immunity.

Current estimates reveal that the percentage of people who received an influenza vaccination during the past 12 months include 49.9 percent of children aged 6 months to 17 years, 31.2 percent of adults 18-49 years, 45.5 percent of adults 50-64 years, and 70 percent of adults 65 years and over.

There are several types of available flu vaccine options, such as the inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and recombinant influenza vaccine (RIV), which are both injected forms, and the live attenuated influenza vaccine (LAIV), also known as the ""nasal spray"" flu vaccine.

Recent observational studies have shown that the flu nasal spray is ineffective, which has led to the Centers for Disease Control Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommending that the nasal spray flu vaccine should not be used during the 2016-2017 flu season.

The results of that research showed that in the last flu season from 2015-2016, the nasal flu vaccine had no protective benefit for children ages 2-17. In comparison, the children that received the flu shot were 63 percent less likely to catch the flu than those people who were not vaccinated.

However, new research published in Annals of Internal Medicine found that immunizing children with the live attenuated influenza vaccine - the type found in the flu nasal spray - did not provide better direct or community protection against flu than the inactivated influenza vaccine, or standard flu shot. The protection was similar in both groups.

Previous studies conducted in young children suggest that the nasal spray vaccine provides better direct flu protection than the standard flu shot, which would also suggest better herd immunity. However, most comparative flu vaccine studies assess direct protection only and do not consider community protection.

Lead study author Dr. Mark Loeb, of McMaster University in Canada, and colleagues conducted the research in the Hutterite community - a colony where individuals live communally and are isolated from cities and towns. The team aimed to identify if vaccinating children and adolescents with the flu nasal spray would provide better direct and community protection than the standard flu shot.

Amongst 52 Hutterite colonies in Alberta and Saskatchewan, Canada, 1,186 children were assigned to receive the nasal spray vaccine and 3,425 to receive the standard flu shot.

The team found that the nasal spray vaccine offered similar direct protection to children and in creating herd immunity as the standard flu shot. Dr. Loeb notes that while the findings do not show the superiority of the nasal spray vaccine over the standard flu shot, what they do show is that both vaccines had a similar effect, which differs from the ACIP data.

The new recommendation against using the flu nasal spray is for the upcoming 2016-2017 flu season. However, the CDC review new data to maintain or change recommendations on a yearly basis.

While lifestyle factors - such as poor diet, lack of exercise, and smoking - are known risk factors for poor health in older age, the research from Dr. and colleagues has focused on how factors inherited from parents may impact healthy aging.

Earlier this year, the team published a study in the journal Aging that found that the offspring of parents who live longer are more likely to possess genes that protect against a number of health conditions, including high blood pressure, high body mass index (BMI), and type 1 diabetes.

The new study builds on those findings, establishing a link between parents' lifespan and disease incidence among offspring.

To reach their findings, the team analyzed the data of around 186,000 adults aged 55-73, following them for up to 8 years.

Participants self-reported the lifespan of their parents, and subjects' incidence of certain diseases - such as heart disease and cancer - and death from these diseases were monitored.

Compared with adults whose parents had a shorter lifespan, those whose parents lived longer were less likely to develop a number of cardiovascular-related conditions, including heart disease, heart failure, stroke, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and atrial fibrillation - abnormal heart rhythm.

In detail, the team found that for every 10 years at least one parent lived after the age of 70, the risk of death from heart disease among offspring was reduced by 20 percent.

Furthermore, sons and daughters of parents who had a longer lifespan were also less likely to develop cancer; each longer-lived parent was associated with a 7 percent lower cancer risk for offspring.

These findings remained relevant after accounting for a number of potentially confounding factors, including smoking, high alcohol consumption, low physical activity, and obesity, the team reports.

""To our knowledge, this is the largest study to show that the longer your parents live, the more likely you are to remain healthy in your 60s and 70s. Asking about parents' longevity could help us predict our likelihood of aging well and developing conditions such as heart disease, in order to identify patients at higher or lower risk in time to treat them appropriately.""

Study co-author Prof. George Kuchel, of the Center on Aging at the University of Connecticut, notes that aging is a major risk factor for chronic diseases, such as heart disease, and the team's findings highlight the important role our parents play in the development of such conditions.

""As we understand these parental factors better, we should be able to help more people to age well,"" he adds.

"Medical News Today: What are BUN Levels and What Do They Measure?","Learn all about BUN levels, how they are measured, and when a BUN test might be used. This article also looks at ways to keep BUN levels healthy.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312337.php","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Urology / Nephrology","What are BUN Levels and What Do They Measure?A BUN, or Blood Urea Nitrogen test, measures the level of urea nitrogen in the blood using a standard blood sample. Urea nitrogen is the natural byproduct of the breakdown of protein.

According to the American Association for Clinical Chemistry, BUN tests are mainly used to assess kidney health. However, altered BUN counts can be the result of almost any disease, drug, or condition that affects the kidneys or liver.

As such, the test may be requested as part of routine checkups. BUN tests are also included in common blood tests, such as metabolic panels.

Medical professionals use BUN tests for a number of reasons, mostly to check or monitor kidney and liver function.

As the waste product of protein digestion, the liver and kidneys influence blood urea nitrogen levels heavily.

Urea is released by the liver into the blood and sent to the kidneys to be removed in the urine. Nitrogen is found in urea and is also the compound responsible for helping clear excess nitrogen from the body. For this reason, ""urea"" and ""urea nitrogen"" are often used to mean the same thing.

A component of many other blood tests, BUN tests may be ordered for just about anyone at any time. They require only a blood sample. A BUN test may also be done alongside other kidney tests, such as the creatine test.

BUN tests are usually ordered in cases of suspected kidney or liver disease. Though common in adults, signs of these diseases are easily overlooked or mistaken for other conditions.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 10 percent of adults in the United States have long-term kidney disease. Many people are unaware that they have the condition.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases explain that a range of medications can impact BUN levels, or how the kidney and liver work. Over-the-counter painkillers, in particular NSAIDS or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, can all affect the kidneys. This class of drugs includes ibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin.

Natural diuretics, such as caffeine, and steroid use can also affect the kidneys. Antibiotics can also impact BUN levels.

There are many prescription drugs that can affect the kidneys, resulting in abnormal BUN levels, including:

According to the National Kidney Foundation, dietary supplements can also have a negative effect on the kidneys and alter BUN levels.

Generally, natural health products are not regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). This means that the effective dosage, source, and even the precise mixture of the supplement is questionable.

This lack of regulation also means herbal supplements may contain kidney-damaging compounds like heavy metals or chemicals like aristolochic acid.

People with kidney or liver disease are normally advised to avoid natural supplement. They are also advised to limit or monitor phosphorous and potassium intake.

Preparing for a BUN test is relatively simple. Those undergoing the test are advised to eat and drink as normal before the test. This helps ensure that results are more of a reflection of long-term levels.

Bringing a list of current medications and supplements on the day of the test can be helpful.

To perform the BUN test, a medical professional will draw blood from a vein. They will often use a vein on the inside of the elbow or outside of the hand. Technicians will then examine the blood sample.

After the sample has been drawn and the proper waiting period has passed, most people immediately return to their usual routine. The results will be sent to the requesting physician.

If the puncture site becomes painful, inflamed, or weeps pus or blood, the patient should seek medical attention. After the test, some patients may also feel faint, hungry, or dehydrated.

A rise or fall in blood urea nitrogen levels may indicate a wide range of health problems. This is because the kidneys and liver are involved in a wide range of body functions.

According to the Medical Council of Canada, normal blood urea nitrogen levels range between 7 and 22 milligrams per deciliter. A result higher than 50 milligrams per deciliter is likely to signal an underlying health problem.

Changes in BUN levels also occur with age and gender, among individuals, and during pregnancy.

Typically, BUN levels increase with age. BUN counts in toddlers are just 66 percent of those in an average healthy adult, and rates in those over 60 are just higher than in young adults.

BUN tests can also help determine the effectiveness of kidney treatments like dialysis.

BUN tests alone are not enough to diagnose any condition.

If BUN results come back as abnormal, medical professionals will usually follow up with other tests. A creatinine test and renal panel can help indicate kidney and liver health. Testing may be done to determine specific substance levels as well, like potassium, sodium, and calcium. Urine tests may also be ordered.

In some instances, physicians may also follow up abnormal BUN results by requesting tests to evaluate the blood creatinine to BUN ratio. The ratio of BUN to creatinine is usually between 10:1 and 20:1.

The course of treatment for each person with abnormal BUN levels varies depending on the cause and severity of the case. Those with organ failure often need intensive treatment, and dialysis may be necessary. Lesser BUN problems may simply require long-term monitoring.

In the case of abnormal BUN levels brought about by eating too much protein, people can limit eating food rich in protein, like meat, fish, beans, and dairy, and increasing fruit and vegetable intake. Staying hydrated also helps prevent the buildup of BUN.

BUN levels have also been tied to high blood pressure and conditions that cause restricted blood flow such as diabetes. As stress can greatly impact blood pressure, exercising, seeking counseling, and reducing stress levels may help steady BUN levels. Controlling blood sugar levels can also promote healthy BUN levels.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Is acetaminophen in pregnancy linked to behavioral problems in offspring?","A study suggests that acetaminophen use, generally considered safe during pregnancy, may lead to a higher rate of behavioral issues in children.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312327.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Pregnancy / Obstetrics","Is acetaminophen in pregnancy linked to behavioral problems in offspring?Acetaminophen - also known as paracetamol - features in a wide range of over-the-counter (OTC) remedies, including actifed, panadol, and Tylenol. Prescription medicines that contain it include oxycodone and tramadol.

Apart from pain and fever, it is also included in treatments for allergy, cough, colds, flu, and sleep problems.

The United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommend a maximum dose of 4,000 milligrams of acetaminophen in a 24-hour period, because overuse can lead to serious liver problems. However, as it is often combined with other ingredients, patients may not realize how much they are taking.

Previous research in animals has suggested that acetaminophen use during gestation can lead to neurodevelopmental problems, possibly due to a disruption in the endocrine function - the body system that regulates the hormones.

Studies of children in Denmark and New Zealand have revealed higher levels of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) or ADHD-type symptoms in those whose mothers used the drug during pregnancy. The FDA have expressed concerns about the use of acetaminophen and other OTC pain relief drugs during pregnancy.

Researchers led by Evie Stergiakouli, from Bristol University in the United Kingdom, studied data for 7,796 mothers who took part in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children from 1991-1992, along with their children and partners.

The team studied associations between behavioral problems in children and the use of acetaminophen by their mothers before and after giving birth. They also examined acetaminophen use by the women's partners.

They distributed questionnaires to assess the use of acetaminophen at weeks 18 and 32 of pregnancy, and when the children were 5 years old.

When the children were 7 years old, their mothers completed questionnaires about their behavior.

At 18 weeks of pregnancy, 4,415 mothers, or 53 percent, said they used acetaminophen. At 32 weeks, 3,381 mothers, or 42 percent, reported using it. The most common reasons for use were headaches, musculoskeletal problems, and infections during pregnancy.

After giving birth, 6,916 mothers, or 89 percent, and 3,454 partners, or 84 percent, used acetaminophen.

Behavioral problems were reported in 5 percent of children.

The findings indicate that children born to women who used of acetaminophen at 18 and 32 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have behavioral problems and to be hyperactive. Those whose mothers used acetaminophen at 32 weeks of pregnancy were more likely to have emotional and other challenges.

The use of acetaminophen by mothers and partners after the child was born was not linked with any behavioral problems, and the team did not find a link between maternal ADHD and the behavioral problems of the children in the study.

This, say the authors, suggests that the behavioral issues are not due to other, unmeasured social or behavior factors related to acetaminophen use.

A limitation of the study is that it does not reveal how much acetaminophen was used or for how long, but the authors believe that there is a link, and that something happens in the womb to cause this reaction. They call for more studies to confirm the results, to find out exactly what happens, or to see if there is another reason.

They also warn, however, that ""the risk of not treating fever or pain during pregnancy should be carefully weighed against any potential harm of acetaminophen to the offspring.""

"Medical News Today: Gout flare-ups could be managed by blood pressure diet","Gout is both painful and common, yet the mechanisms behind it are not known. A new analysis of old data shows that easy dietary changes may keep it at bay.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312314.php","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Gout","Gout flare-ups could be managed by blood pressure dietGout is a rheumatic condition caused by a buildup of uric acid in the joints, known as hyperuricemia.

It is the most common form of inflammatory arthritis in men. Gout normally strikes in the base joint of the big toe and can be debilitatingly painful.

Flare-ups can last for days or even weeks, causing an individual significant discomfort.

Although the exact mechanisms that lead to a gout event are not fully understood, some risk factors are known; these include alcohol intake, hypertension (high blood pressure), insulin resistance, and a diet rich in red meat and seafood.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2007-2008, 3.9 percent of all American adults and 5.9 percent of men (6.1 million individuals) had gout.

They also report that overall incidence of gout has risen 1.2 percent over the previous 20 years.

Although the dietary factors mentioned above are known to play a role in elevating levels of uric acid in the blood, the exact causes remain a mystery. Researchers from Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, MD, recently set out to investigate the influence of diet on gout in more detail.

Dr. Stephen P. Juraschek and his colleagues reopened data from a clinical trial carried out in 1997 called DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension). The landmark study demonstrated that the DASH diet - reduction in salt, an increase in whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and less red meat, sweets, and saturated fats - significantly improved blood pressure and cholesterol.

In the DASH-Sodium experiment, more than 400 participants were given either a DASH diet or a typical American diet for 3 months. Each month, participants were given differing amounts of sodium - 1.2 grams (low), 2.3 grams (medium), or 3.4 grams (high). The higher figure equates to a standard American diet.

Before the trial began and after each month, the researchers analyzed the participants' blood for various chemical markers; these included uric acid.

Dr. Juraschek and his team recently reopened the data set and analyzed the effects of each of the salt interventions on uric acid concentration.

Overall, the DASH diet led to a uric acid decrease of 0.35 milligrams per deciliter. Although that is only a moderate decrease, the team found that the change was greater for individuals who had the highest levels of uric acid at baseline. Participants with a reading of 7 milligrams per deciliter at the start of the study showed a reduction of 1.3 milligrams per deciliter.

To put that figure into perspective, drugs designed to treat gout, such as allopurinol, generally lower uric acid levels by 2 milligrams per deciliter.

When the team examined the interaction between sodium levels and uric acid, the findings surprised them - they were the opposite to expectations. During the low salt phase of the DASH diet, uric acid levels were at their highest; during the medium and high sodium diets, levels were reduced.

These changes due to salt intake were small but significant.

The authors, however, do not recommend that people with gout start adding salt to their diet. ""More than 70 percent of people with gout have high blood pressure,"" says Dr. Juraschek. ""If one was to consume more sodium to improve uric acid, it could worsen blood pressure.""

The results of the analysis are published this week in the journal Arthritis and Rheumatology. Although further studies will be necessary to confirm the findings, the researchers are optimistic. If the DASH diet can prevent or at least minimize gout flare-ups, it would be of substantial benefit for gout sufferers.

Gout currently costs the healthcare system of America around $7.7 billion. A dietary change that controls gout while simultaneously controlling hypertension and cholesterol levels could make a significant difference to millions of lives.

"Campaigners slam government s obesity strategy","The government has let down future generations with a watered-down strategy that will fail to adequately tackle the rising swell of obesity in the country, campaigners say.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/campaigners_slam_governments_obesity_strategy_1102674","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 10:38:31 +0100","NA","The government has let down future generations with a watered-down strategy that will fail to adequately tackle the rising swell of obesity in the country, campaigners say.

A third of children are already overweight or obese by the time they leave primary school, and, based on current trends, half of all children will be obese or overweight by 2020. The NHS in England already spends more than  5 billion a year on overweight and obesity-related ill-health.

It had been hoped that the long-awaited childhood obesity strategy would follow recommendations from Public Health England, particularly curbs on junk food advertising and multi-buy promotions to help address the crisis, neither of which feature in the strategy.

""Even after delaying publication for a whole year, the government has fallen far short of what is needed and is failing to take the necessary measures to tackle childhood obesity,"" said the Obesity Health Alliance, a coalition of 33 leading national charities, Medical Royal Colleges, and campaign groups.

Under the plan, the government is to introduce a soft drinks industry levy on producers and importers across the UK, designed to encourage a reduction in the amount of sugar contained in these products. In England, the revenue from the levy will be invested in programmes to reduce obesity and encourage physical activity and balanced diets for school age children.

It will also launch a ""broad, structured sugar reduction programme"" to remove sugar from the products children eat most, with all sectors of the food and drinks industry challenged to - voluntarily - reduce overall sugar across a range of products that contribute to children's sugar intakes by at least 20 percent by 2020, including a 5 percent reduction in year one.

However, the measures on their own ""will not tackle the obesity crisis and are not sufficient to reduce the rising toll of ill-health, premature deaths and unsustainable costs to the NHS,"" the Alliance warns.

The group welcomed the government's soft drinks industry levy consultation ""as a bold and positive step forward,"" but stressed that the plan outlined ""lacks ambition and will fail to tackle childhood obesity as promised in the Government's manifesto"".

""This strategy was Britain's opportunity to lead the way and to implement real, meaningful environmental change, to start removing the crippling financial burden from our NHS and reversing the tide of diet-related disease,"" said celebrity chef and healthy eating campaigner Jamie Oliver. ""With this disappointing, and frankly, underwhelming strategy the health of our future generations remains at stake"".

Dr Helen Stokes-Lampard, spokesperson for the Royal College of GPs, also said ""it's disappointing that some of the more radical initiatives expected, such as a ban on pre-watershed junk food advertising, that could potentially help to curb rising levels of childhood obesity, don't feature in today's report,"" but she also argued that the measures that do ""are positive steps forward"".

""After the farce of the responsibility deal where Andrew Lansley made the food industry responsible for policing themselves, it is sad to see that this is just another imitation of the same responsibility deal take two,"" said Prof Graham MacGregor, chairman of Action on Sugar and Consensus Action on Salt and Health, as reported by the Guardian.

Current regulations stipulate that experimental medicines are assessed in at least two species - one rodent and one non-rodent (such as a min-pig of non-human primate) - before they can be tested in human trials.

According to Home Office statistics on repeat-dose toxicity tests (just one kind of test for which animals are used), in 2015 there were 9,636 procedures using mice, 29,597 with rats, 2,454 with dogs and 1,330 with non-human primates.

The new project will see NC3Rs ask pharma companies to share data on use of two animal species to determine whether current approaches are in line with best science and offer the highest level of patient safety, and explore if use of just one species pre-human testing could be sufficient.

""A number of similar studies have been published by others with differing outcomes on the need for testing in two species. Our project will have the advantage that we will have access to published and unpublished data and the expert input of industry and regulatory scientists,"" writes NC3Rs chief executive Dr Vicky Robinson in a blog on the collaboration.

A working group convened by the NC3Rs and led by the group's Dr Helen Prior, whose post is funded by the ABPI, will oversee the project, and a number companies have already committed to sharing data, it said.

ABPI and the NC3Rs have now been working together for 12 years on appropriate use of animals in testing.

""This collaboration has been incredibly valuable in supporting industry's implementation of the 3Rs [reduction, refinement, and replacement of animals] across medicines development, to achieve both the best science and best animal welfare,"" said Dr Paul Brooker, chair of the ABPI Nonclinical and Biological Discovery Expert Network (NaBDEN).","Healthcare"

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has now published draft guidelines advising that certain indications for Novartis' Afinitor (everolimus) and Janssen's Imbruvica (ibrutinib) are not cost effective, meaning that they could be pulled from the CDF.

In the case of Afinitor, the Institute ruled that the drug is effective in delaying growth and spread of breast cancer when used in combination with exemestane, new overall survival data suggest it is less clinically effective previously thought.

""The committee considered that even with the price discount in the revised patient access scheme, everolimus plus exemestane would not be cost effective,"" noted NICE's chief executive Sir Andrew Dillon.

When looking at Imbruvica for MCL, the independent appraisal committee also recognised that the drug is clinically effective but when compared with current treatment the benefits are unclear.

The price put forward by the company, incorporating a patient access scheme offered a discount, but was still ""substantially above the normal range considered cost-effective for use in the NHS,"" it said, noting that, for all but one of the scenarios presented by Janssen, the incremental cost-effective ratio was above  70,000 per QALY gained.

Janssen said it is disappointed with the decision. Jennifer Lee, Director of Health Economics, Market Access & Reimbursement at Janssen UK, said: ""Ibrutinib is the most requested treatment on the CDF for patients with this hard-to-treat cancer,"" and that the firm ""remains committed to continuing to work with both NICE and NHS England, to ensure that permanent access to ibrutinib is achieved for patients with relapsed or refractory MCL through a positive NICE recommendation.""

In response to Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt's comments last week that any patient needing cataract surgery should get it ""without delay"", the charity says ""this just isn't happening"", and that some are being forced ""to live with unnecessary sight loss and a reduced quality of life"".

In a letter to the Health Secretary, it stressed that cataract surgery is still being rationed for financial reasons, despite it being approved by the National institute for Health and Care Excellence.

The recent case where St Helens Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) recently announced but then retracted its statement that it would temporarily suspend routine operations in a bid to save cash is ""just one example of decisions being made as a result of cost-cutting rather than clinically-led"".

""Whilst St Helens CCG has now dropped these plans, they are still exploring ways to save money and we're concerned this could include cataract surgery,"" the charity noted, adding: ""no decision about me without me"" principle means that patients should have the opportunity to discuss the merits and risks of surgery with a professional. However, this is being significantly undermined as a result of CCGs' arbitrary policies"".

The Royal College of Ophthalmologists (RCOphth) has also expressed concerns about potential rationing and postponement of second eye cataract surgery which, it stressed, should also be performed based entirely clinical need.

""The [College] understands the financial pressures the NHS faces but we believe that any restriction, postponement or delay in cataract surgery made through commissioning decisions will not produce the efficiencies or cost savings expected,"" said its president Professor Carrie MacEwen.

The RCOphth anticipates an increase of around 50 percent in the number of cataract operations needed over the next 20 years due to an ageing population, but insists that cataract surgery ""is a highly cost effective and efficient surgery that has a rapid effect in restoring a patient's vision and preserving their ability to live an independent life"".

The RNIB has asked for the Health Secretary's support in calling on commissioning groups to ""urgently implement"" NICE-accredited cataract commissioning guidance to secure the best and most appropriate care for patients.","Healthcare"

Also, 77 percent of trusts are failing to notify patients of their rights under the NHS Constitution when the 18 week limit has been missed, the report notes.

The research - taken from 78 percent of 112 trusts responding to freedom of information requests - also found that average waiting times for five procedures (hip replacement, knee replacement, hernia, adenoid and tonsillectomies) exceed 100 days, representing the highest average waiting time in the six years data has been collected.

Also of note, trusts cancelled an average of 753 patient surgeries 'on the day' last year, the most common reasons for which were equipment shortages and/or lack of beds, it said.

Elsewhere, the number of emergency admissions varies wildly from 1,840 to 6,046 per 1,000 of the population, as does the mortality rate for those with recorded mention of dementia, from 441 to 1,617 per 1,000, while the number of patients with dementia who have a blood test recorded ranges across the country from 57.3 percent to 86.6 percent.

""The Atlas exposes varied care, with some areas reporting much higher numbers of emergency hospital admissions,"" noted the Alzheimer's Society. ""We must urgently explore why people with dementia's needs are escalating to this point and what can be done in the community to prevent crisis admissions among this vulnerable group"".

 

""As our Fix Dementia Care campaign unearthed, it's currently easier to find out about your hospital's finances than the quality of dementia care they provide,"" it added. ""To make hospital's more transparent and accountable, we are calling for them to publish an annual statement on dementia care - this would include the number of readmissions and length of stay. We would like to see this level of detailed information featured in the Atlas so we know where to focus efforts to improve standards.""

Actress given Ambassador role

Meanwhile, it was announced that oscar-nominated actress Carey Mulligan has been appointed by the Alzheimer's Society and Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt as the first ever UK Global Dementia Friends Ambassador.

In her new role, Ms Mulligan will bring both international attention to the benefits of making communities dementia friendly, and a renewed focus on the Alzheimer's Society's Dementia Friends programme in England, the charity said.

""At the moment, there's not nearly enough awareness and as a global society we have a duty to change that,"" she said, adding: ""The first step involves educating people and breaking down stigma   not just on our doorstep, but across the world"".","Healthcare"

The nasally-administered drug is a non-competitive and subtype non-selective activity-dependent N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, offering a new mechanism of action from currently available therapies for depression.

If approved by the FDA, esketamine would be one of the first new approaches to treat major depressive disorder - which affects around 16 million people in the US alone - available to patients in the last 50 years.

""In the US alone, there are more than 41,000 suicides each year, many of which result from untreated or poorly treated major depression,"" said Husseini Manji, global head, Neuroscience Therapeutic Area, Janssen.

""This designation reinforces the potential of esketamine as a novel treatment for patients with major depressive disorder who are at imminent risk for suicide, a condition for which there currently is no approved treatment and which represents a major public health challenge"".

The investigational antidepressant already carries breakthrough status for treatment resistant depression, which is currently being investigated in Phase III clinical trials, and Janssen expects it to ultimately pull in sales of more than $1 billion.","Healthcare"

The new Phase I/II trial - called SPIRE and run by the charity's Centre for Drug Development and the Experimental Cancer Medicines Centre (ECMC) network - will test a drug called guadecitabine (SGI-110) in combination with chemotherapy to see if it can treat the disease and stop patients becoming resistant.

Astex Pharmaceuticals' guadecitabine is a type of DNA methyltransferase inhibitor that blocks molecules that can modify DNA. In cancer these molecules turn off genes that should be on, causing resistance to chemotherapy.

The first part of the study will give small doses of the drug to between three and 36 patients with advanced solid tumours, including bladder, lung, stomach and oesophageal cancers, to ensure it is safe and to find the most effective dose, after which it will be tested in 20 bladder cancer patients to gauge its effectiveness.

According to the workforce survey, published by the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, than more than half of paediatric units are failing to meet recommended staffing standards, leaving 89 percent of clinical directors concerned about how child health services will cope in the next six months (up from 78 percent last year).

The survey found that more than one in four general paediatric posts at senior trainee level are now vacant, and that 60 percent of tier 1* and 77 percent of tier 2** rotas, which are mainly made up of junior doctors, have not been able to attract the full complement of 10 full-time staff.

Commenting on the findings, Dr Simon Clark, workforce officer at the Royal College, warned that the paediatric workforce is at breaking point and children's healthcare is increasingly being compromised.

""There is no escaping the fact that an increase in junior and consultant posts is urgently needed, coupled with a radical re-design of services,"" he said.

However, because it can take eight years to complete paediatric training and as long to implement service alterations, the RCPCH has made a number of immediate recommendations to help sustain services for children in the short-term, including a breakdown of barriers to multi-disciplinary working, an increase in children's nurses and immediate opportunities for GP colleagues to access child health training.

According to Dr Clark, continuing to deliver the service as it currently stands is not sustainable. ""I urge decision makers to increase trainee and consultant numbers, better map training places to demand, and plan emergency and non-emergency rotas well in advance"".

*Tier 1 rotas are mainly made up of trainees with a small number of Advanced Nurse Practitioners (ANP), Specialty and Associated Specialty Grade (SASG) and Trust doctors; Tier 2 rotas are mainly consist of more senior trainees, with a small number of ANP, SASG and Trust doctors.

It s really only the beginning. The use of the data will continue and in 10, 20 years from now people will be doing different things with the data than we ever imagined.  Michael Kinsella of Servier

Industry stakeholders have insisted that it could be a costly mistake to view serialisation as a project which only concerns engineering matters. As serialisation data is unique to the pack it requires not only the deployment of new treatment but also expanded staff investment and stakeholder engagement. Therefore,  To characterize it as an engineering issue is therefore to grossly underestimate its consequences, which touch virtually every business function in pharmaceutical manufacturing. 2

The updating of hardware for packaging lines may on first appearances seem to be a usual project comprising of routine timescales and considerations. However, some cases in the market have conveyed that installing and commissioning integrated serialisation ready hardware ends up being considerably more complex than first assumed. 2 New equipment capabilities have to be met in response to data requirements  including multi-substrate inks for TIJ printers and printer abilities to perform to aggregation and verification.

Effective data management is imperative to achieve regulatory compliance with a serialisation programme. Non-standard data exchange and integration methods are seen as one of the biggest hurdles in serialisation compliance.4 These projects will also incur a surge in the amount of data shared between trading partners, with the volume of data units being determined by the length of the supply chain in question.

In light of the data responsibilities expected within serialisation projects, Pharma IQ consults with a selection of experts on software best practices - data integration and implementation.

Download the early draft agenda for the Serialisation and Traceability Event  taking place from 02-04 November, 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland. Download the agenda here

Pharma firms should have a clear map of their current and their target architecture, due to the evolving ecosystem that operates in many pharma companies. Michael Kinsella, Program Director, Serialisation & Traceability at Servier notes that the pharma firm is currently rolling out a SAP implementation at their main sites simultaneously alongside other rationalisation projects concerning historical IT systems.

So, here, a clear roadmap is imperative to ensure Servier is synchronized with their master data requirements to fulfill the needs in a timely fashion.

In response to partnership interaction with CMOs, Michael Kinsella from Servier noted:  The CMO area is quite tricky and it s often left until the last step because there is a lot of hesitancy about specifying  responsibilities. Who s going to pay for the interfaces? You may even have equipment that needs to be put into the CMOs to perform some of the data exchanges, you may need scanners, you may need relabeling, you may need reprinting or re-aggregation capabilities in order to be able to send data back to a mother system and to maintain the integrity. So it s really quite complex.  He adds that assessing CMO interaction is often underestimated. CMOs usually wait for the client to explain their needs, as it is the pharma companies who hold the marketing authorizations that are under the obligation to ensure boxes leave the factories in a conforming manner.

Depending on the responsibility or the contract held between various partners or the pharmaceutical company, it is not always completely clear what kind of investments the CMOs need to make and the interfaces they are responsible for.

 I think the first steps are not the specification of the interface itself   but more mapping out the relationship and the responsibility the business needs. - Michael Kinsella

This will involve categorizing the partners the pharma firm has, the type of CMOs and their responsibilities and requirements. Different arrangements may occur according to the authorisation of a product or the delegation of responsibility in the production, packaging and distribution of a product. Michael notes that in some cases pharma firms may decide not to  integrate their systems into, or to interface with the CMO s systems or exchange data. They may simply connect to the national database to which the data is transmitted to. In other cases, there may be a business need to exchange data to facilitate certain business activities, especially where the product is still in the possession of the pharma firm.  If the product has left their possession or has been sold, the responsibilities for the data integrity or data exchanges change somewhat.

"The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia","Bumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer. This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve","http://www.pharma-iq.com/medical-devices-and-diagnostics/articles/the-impact-of-cognitive-computing-on-healthcare-in","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, August 09, 2016</span>","NA","The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesBumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer. This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve patient outcomes. To find out more, we speak with Dr James Miser, Chief Medical Information Officer at Bumrungrad International Hospital, who describes the implementation process so far and how the technology is likely to transform healthcare.

  To date, Watson for Oncology has compiled nearly 15 million pages of medical content, including more than 200 medical textbooks and 300 medical journals.

  Watson can assemble and assess patient information along with relevant medical information from its entire database in less than a minute.

  Watson provides medical professionals with instant access to information from leading research institutions from around the world.

  At Bumrungrad International Hospital, staff will be using Watson to make their data organization more efficient and ultimately the system will help them decide on the best course of treatment for patients.

How is cognitive computing changing the way medicine is being practised?

Dr James Miser:  Medicine is changing dramatically, in large part due to our genetic and molecular understanding of ourselves and the diseases that we can contract. In essence, we re getting more complicated to medically understand. This leads to greater quantities of patient information and the necessity for more organisation of said information, along with more disease and treatment information. 

 Within the next 5-10 years, this mass of accumulated patient, disease and treatment information is going to become dramatically more complex. In order to give patients the best treatment  options, all of that data needs to be available immediately. This represents an immense challenge for physicians all over the world. Fortunately, a cognitive computing solution is able to absorb thousands of medical journals, textbooks, papers and guidelines from leading institutions in order to piece together the most appropriate data and outline the best course of action for the patient. 

Why is this of particular importance in Southeast Asia?

Dr James Miser:  The challenges in Southeast Asia are magnified because of the uneven distribution of  healthcare throughout the region, for example, the differences between major medical centres and more rural areas. If we can address this balance with cloud based cognitive computing solutions then I think we can have more of an impact here than anywhere else. 

Dr James Miser:  It s a cloud-based system meaning that primary, secondary and tertiary care centres would all have access to it. So even if a primary care centre was unable to properly diagnose a patient or provide the suggested treatment (many cancers require molecular diagnosis with advanced technological processes), its staff would be able to accurately determine where the patient needs to be referred to, with a clear idea of what tests and potential treatments may be  necessary. 

What benefits does using Watson give your colleagues in the oncology department at present?

Dr James Miser:   We re just about to start actively using Watson, which means we re piloting it after numerous test cases. So to be honest, initially the results will be modest but over time it will become more and more important as it is used in connection with a wider variety of cancers and cancer patients, especially in complex cases where the cancer regresses and then reappears often.

 Currently, it will help doctors using the system become more efficient as it helps organise the data, combine the relevant healthcare literature, provide roadmaps and so on. All of these processes will quickly become standardised too, which will allow healthcare professionals to practise in a more efficient and timely manner. 

So it s accurate to say that the benefits delivered by Watson haven t been fully realised yet and are going to increase significantly as more healthcare professionals become used to utilising it?



Dr James Miser:   Certainly. It s also going to deliver increased benefits for patients too in terms of helping to design more effective treatment plans. By March we re hoping to be able to present more concrete data regarding this area. The key issue is ensuring the information is available across the entire healthcare network, so that each medical professional involved is properly informed and can subsequently keep the patient properly informed at every step. In this way,

everybody benefits: the hospitals and healthcare professionals benefit financially and get a boost to their reputation, but more importantly, the patients will benefit. Instead of feeling cut off from the care that they need, they can go to their local healthcare facility and receive a diagnosis and treatment plan supported by the entire hospital network s expertise based on effective dissemination of information. 

Can you give a ballpark estimate regarding how much of an impact the system will have on oncology department efficiency rates?

Dr James Miser:  Cancer diagnosis requires the completion and analysis of multiple tests which Watson can carry out for the doctor. It can gather all of the patient s data, organise it and ensure it is complete before consulting its databank of medical literature and then making a suggestion on what the best treatment might be, based on its findings. All of this can be done in perhaps less than a minute   it s more to do with the speed of the internet than anything else. Moreover, it doesn t give just the best treatment option, it also suggests the next best option, and the next, with more options available if necessary. In some cases this is more for the patient to decide, because what s best for one patient may not be best for another, like whether or not to receive chemotherapy, for example. Essentially, Watson puts all of those options, all of the relevant data, literature and several other information tools right at the doctor s fingertips. It s really going to help them make efficient, informed decisions in a much more timely manner. 

We ve been talking primarily about Watson s impact on oncology. What other applications and impacts do you see this technology having?

Dr James Miser:   I think that Watson has wider applications to health in general. It can be applied to all types of cancer but it also has applications to the treatment of any serious or chronic disease because it can keep medical professionals updated on the latest practices, treatments and therapies as they are developed 

Will the costs of implementing Watson keep it prohibitively expensive for other less well-funded medical institutions?

Dr James Miser:   Watson was certainly expensive to develop but like any technology the costs of implementing it will decrease over time. For example, initially it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to map the human genome but now it only costs around $1000. In the same way, once Watson is applied more broadly, I imagine that the costs will decrease dramatically. There s even a case to be made by governments that its implementation will eventually save money as it improves healthcare efficiency. Ultimately, Watson can and should be implemented outside of the wealthiest institutions, because they already have the expertise, so they have less of a need for Watson s capabilities. It s in more remote and less specialised healthcare facilities in regions like South-East Asia that Watson will have the greatest impact on improving the overall health of the population and I believe that IBM and the other developers of Watson have that vision for their creation. 

What advice would you give any other healthcare organisation that is looking to integrate Watson into their existing processes?

Dr James Miser:  It s essential that you are able to link Watson to your medical staff effectively. Creating the right user interface and the right IT platform takes time, care, diligence and ICT expertise in order to create a scenario where your employees have a seamless connection to the expertise provided by Watson. So it s vital that you create a team of both ICT technicians and healthcare professionals to design that integration effectively. It s also very important to ensure that the right training in the use of Watson is carried out, so that everyone is up to speed with what it can do and how best to utilise its information tools.

 Due to its cloud-based nature, Watson isn t a simple  straight out of the box  tool; it does need some time and thought to go into its implementation. However, it is a fantastically user-friendly system and can be effectively integrated with any healthcare ICT systems. ","Pharmaceuticals"

The most popular professional social media networking website is LinkedIn which was acquired by Microsoft in June 2016 and has greater than 100 million registered users. With such a large outreach, these and other less well-known social media communication and networking websites are being utilised with increasing frequency by commercial organisations to communicate with existing customers as well as to lure new ones. In the case of the pharmaceutical industry, social media is now actively used to convey information relating to education, marketing, connecting with patients/physicians and receiving feedback. The major pharmaceutical companies have links on their websites to multiple social media websites and the potential of these is vast and thus far is largely untapped. However, statistics such as the number of visitors to these social media websites is comparable to those of other large industries such as finance and oil.

Benefits and risks of social media for the pharmaceutical industry

Safeguarding of information that the pharmaceutical industry disseminates via social media is essential. Although pharmaceutical industry websites contain a wealth of useful information, there appears to be a general apprehension in their use to disseminate medically relevant information [3]. The benefits of social media for the pharmaceutical industry are significant, such as its high outreach with messages being broadcast to other market segments [4]. A public hearing on the promotion of FDA regulated medical products using the internet and social media tools was held in 2009 with the presentations for all stakeholders that attended made available and this is a valuable resource [5]. Subsequently, a social media guidance webinar was held in July 2014 with all material also being publically available [6]. This is especially relevant, as the FDA have issued warnings in some cases where the existence of potentially objectionable information has been identified on social media websites [7]. The pharmaceutical industry should tread carefully in this territory, especially with third party data being a potential liability. This is because an imbalanced view of a product s risks and bene ts with erroneous claims being posted by such third parties (largely consumers) may capture the attention of regulators [8].

New trends and likely future directions

Despite the above caveats, social media offers significant benefits that should not be underestimated. Recent trends indicate encouraging signs of change as the latest raft of guidelines provides more clarity detailing new FDA guidelines [9, 10]. There are limitations of social media and the somewhat unclear regulations have impeded the pharmaceutical industry from utilising this channel whole-heartedly. However, the recent spate of laws governing social media use has brought more clarity to its use and may potentially embolden the pharmaceutical industry.

As such, access to large clinical populations that represent a diversity of backgrounds and risk factors, could provide a solid foundation for the next major development in large-scale dementia trials.

The ways in which dementia impacts on an individual can manifest in different ways, depending on a number of contributing factors, such as the person s personality and their lifestyle prior to becoming sick. It is widely accepted that the symptoms of dementia are broken into three stages. These stages include:

The early stage: where the symptoms are relatively nuanced. Due to the gradual decline that is experienced in this stage, there is rarely any clinical intervention, despite, perhaps, the recommended alleviation of risk factors.

The middle stage: the disease becomes more prominent and the symptoms begin to impact on the individual, their family and/or their carer.

The late stage: is characterised by the individual s total incapacitation and complete dependence on their carer.  The physical and mental symptoms are obvious and memory disturbance is serious.

The length of time that it takes a patient to move through the three stages, again, is individualized. It is difficult to speculate how any one individual will interact with their physician s intervention. Due to the inconsistent/diverse appearance of symptoms and the broad range of contributing risk factors that may influence how the disease presents, developing a broad clinical population from which to derive data is critical in determining the efficacy and safety of any compound thought to alleviate symptoms and prolong the patients decline.

The scientific leadership that George Clinical engage with have been responsible for some of the world s largest studies into the risk factors that impact dementia.

 What George Clinical and its parent company- The George Institute for Global Health have achieved through their multi-regional trials [has] already had a significant impact on dementia,  Associate Professor Maree Hackett, Director of The George Institute s Neurological and Mental Health Division said.  The George s formidable track record in conducting large-scale, multi-regional trials into salt reduction, blood pressure lowering and stroke management, for example, have no-doubt made a significant dent in the instances of dementia globally. 

Stroke and blood pressure are two major contributors to the development of dementia. The INTERACT trials, led by George Clinical scientific leader, Professor Craig Anderson, is the largest ever clinical trial into acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) ever conducted with 2839 patients participating from 144 hospitals around the world. The study measured the impact blood pressure lowering has on patients after acute brain haemorrhage. The intervention appeared to reduce disability and improve quality of life at 3 months. Similarly, the ENCHANTED trial conducted with over 3000 patients globally, again led by Professor Craig Anderson, analysed the effect of two doses of a clot dissolving agent in acute stroke and showed that by giving a low dose, the risk of brain haemorrhage, a known side effect of this widely used drug, was reduced. These global trials, conducted across a diverse range of patients, countries, backgrounds and cultures provide a solid foundation for similar sized, similarly complex, trials into dementia.

Likewise, George Clinical scientific leader - Professor Bruce Neal leads the ongoing China Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS), the largest study of its kind, conducted in 600 rural villages across five northern provinces in China and Tibet. The study recruited 35 high risk individuals from each village, making a total of 21,000 participants. The rationale being that lowering salt intake will lower blood pressure and the stroke risk in this population. This approach to salt reduction has been identified by the World Health Organization as amongst the most cost-effective strategies for vascular disease prevention. The size, scale and impact of the SSaSS trial is staggering. The wealth of clinical data on one of the major risk factors for dementia, across one of the most populous regions on earth, provides future researchers with unparalleled clinical access and data sources.

 When conducting a clinical trial on something as complex as dementia, access to a largely trial-naive population with diversity demographic characteristics is key,  Associate Professor Hackett said.  The best thing about conducting clinical trials in the Asia-Pacific is that a large and diverse population is available, whose participation can produce definitive trial results   it is inherent to the region! 

As the world s population ages, and more people succumb to the debilitating impact of dementia, the capacity for researchers to access a diversity of clinical populations will be vital to the integrity of clinical trial data and the long-term sustainability of any intervention. Access to clinical populations throughout the diverse Asia-Pacific region, particularly to populations who have been identified as at risk, would provide a more robust data set for addressing a disease such as dementia.","Pharmaceuticals"

While mapping out the areas of interest specifically which would gain investment from pharma firms over 2016, Tom Macfarlane, drug development professional  noted:

 Much growth in the sector is being driven by expansion into developing markets, thus increasing demand for people with international experience. Taking the supply chain as an example, although track-and-trace initiatives should simplify and facilitate logistics in the long-term, in the short term there may be increasing competition for those with specialist knowledge of developing markets.

 Additionally, changes in the broader business model are driving a need for non-traditional skillsets and backgrounds, especially technology and the healthcare-provider/payor side. Pharma companies are digitising their internal processes and data, taking an increasing interest in electronic marketing as a more cost-effective alternative to large teams of sales-reps, and needing to obtain and make use data from patients and heathcare providers. One can see the reflection of this in the healthcare workstreams being pioneered by the tech giants, such as Apple, Google and IBM. 

The Pharma IQ team has conducted some research and compiled this ultimate guide on the pharmaceutical industry's top 10 firms based on the Forbes Fortune 500 ranking. The majority of pharma firms managed to improve their Fortune 500 rankings, with Celgene rising by 65 places.

Please note that the order follows that of the Fortune 500 rank.

First once again emerging first in the pharma industry ranking, J&J saw many successes over the past year, including its award winning efforts with the supply of an Ebola vaccine through Sierra Leone and joining the combat against the Zika Virus. This year saw the opening of JLabs in Toronto, a new 40,000-square-foot life sciences incubator, providing entrepreneurs shared lab space and offices, modular lab suites and access to scientific, industry and capital funding experts as they work to build important and successful early-stage companies.

However, the pharma giant has encountered some complications, for example with a court case arising focusing on alleged side effects of Johnson s baby powder. Also, media reports have noted that there may be a major restructuring in the firm to obtain cost savings, with expected net positions being eliminated from their global medical devices segment standing at around 3000.

Climbing one place in its Fortune 500 rank, Pfizer is reported to be providing 130 new jobs to manufacturing sites in Dublin and Cork. In Q3 of 2015, Pfizer finalised its acquisition of Hospira, Inc - a provider of injectable drugs and biosimilars. Additionally, following the termination of the potential Allergan merger, Pfizer announced that it is considering conducing strategic split in some form.

3 Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada)

Earlier this year, Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada) was reported to have paid US$20 million for an oncology drug produced by a team of scientists at Harvard. This is said to have been the highest upfront cash payment Harvard has ever received from a pharma licensing deal. In regards to the firm s Ebola Zaire, V920 (rVSV G-ZEBOV-GP, live attenuated): the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the vaccine candidate Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) status.

Also,  Merck KGaA owned Sigma-Aldrich is reported to add 100 new jobs to its St.Louis base.

Making considerable progress on its ranking last year, Gilead Sciences has seen a number of wins recently, with the European Commission Grants Marketing Authorization for Gilead s Epclusa   also the firm has a a HIV-1 infection treatment in its pipeline. The firm saw year-on-year growth in total product sales in Q1 of 2016. Gilead s product Sovaldi ranked 3rd  in the world s top global pharmaceuticals in IMS  ranking.

Humira, labelled as the world s best selling drug for the past couple of years, has faced reports of potential competition this year as the US FDA accepted for review Amgen s Biologics License Applicaiont for ABP 501- labeled as a biosimilar candidate for Humira. Abbvie has achieved a number of drug approvals from regulators and have recently announced its oncology clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to assess the combination of Abbvie s Rova-T and BMS  Opdivo as a treatment for  relapsed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

Amgen s Enbrel is estimated to come in 6th in the ranking of top global pharmaceutical products in 2020 by revenue, charted to have accumulated US$7 billion in revenue by 2020. A patent suit has been brought in regards to this product in Q1 of 2016.

In the final quarter of 2015,  Eli Lilly and Merck s extended their Immuno-oncology Collaboration  to evaluate the fusion of Lilly s ALIMTA and Merck s KEYTRUDA. The combination therapy is said to be in Phase III and is focused on first line nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer.

Earlier in 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb signed an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Padlock   biotechnology company focused on the treatment of destructive autoimmune diseases. The deal is set to further strengthen the firm s immunoscience pipeline. Also BMS completed acquisition of Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc.   The trade contains complete rights to Cardioxyl s leading asset   CXL- 1427   which is in phase 2 of clinical development positioned as treatment for acute decompensated heart failure.

Last year Biogen was reported to have reduced its global workforce by around 800 people, in line with its corporate restructuring to focus its R&D pipeline which features Alzheimer disease candidates. Last month, Biogen s investigational alzheimer s disease treatment Aducanumab was accepted into European Medicines Agency s PRIME Program.

Celgene saw the most dramatic rise in ratings out of the Pharma Top 10 companies for 2016 - rising by 65 places. This firm was charted as the second fastest growing pharma company within the fortune 500 in 2015. Its cancer treatment Revlimid is attributed to be the engine behind this surge.  Also, Celgene has made a range of partnerships with small biotech companies.

In providing insight for job seekers in the pharma industry looking for their next opportunity, Tom Macfarlane noted:  Many job-seekers are inclined to focus on the larger multinationals, which they percieve to offer greater security and a greater potential for advancement. However these multinationals are doing an increasing amount of their research by partnering or backing smaller companies, including start-ups, with a view to acquiring them and their assets in the fullness of time. It can therefore makes sense to evaluate a potential employer based on their pipeline, rather than just their size. ","Pharmaceuticals"

Recognition has not been a problem for the field of protein engineering this year. Protein engineering has been receiving special attention though a number of awards ceremonies and other publicity-friendly events. Although protein engineers will never be called  bankable,  a term reserved for the stars of Hollywood blockbusters, they may still leverage their honorifics to achieve something like career stability. Even better, they may secure the funding they need to see ambitious productions through to completion.

Among protein engineering s leading performers, methods vary as dramatically as acting techniques. At one extreme is rational design, which could be called the classical approach. It relies on a comprehensive understanding of the structure and function of existing proteins, and extrapolates from there, gauging how selected structural variations will lead to functional modifications.

Rational design, or de novo design, is a computationally intense approach, and it emphasizes the development of predictive rules for phenomena such as protein folding. These rules guide simulations that not only confirm the folding dynamics of existing and well-characterized proteins (the protein-folding problem), but also predict how novel proteins are likely to fold into three-dimensional structures (the inverse protein-folding problem).

In rational design, models loom large, as they do in classical acting, which is, according to Wikipedia,  based on the theories and systems of select classical actors and directors.  This kind of protein engineering is complemented by another approach, one called directed evolution, which is extreme in its own way. It shuns the calculated approach, the conscious emulation of existing protein structures and the systematic tweaking of these structures by means as tentative as site-directed mutagenesis. No, directed evolution, like the method approach to acting, is a bold shortcut to the heart of the matter.

In directed evolution, mutagenesis is not site directed, but random. And, through random mutagenesis actually multiple rounds of mutagenesis many protein variants are generated, most of which are deleterious. A few of the variants, however, may exhibit even higher degrees of fitness than rationally designed proteins. These exceptional proteins, however, must be identified somehow. Typically, the isolation of the fit (if poorly understood) variants depends on some sort of screening or selection mechanism.

Overall, directed evolution mimics natural evolution. Like the  method  approach to acting, directed evolution may seem a strenuous and even painful way to achieve something that has the ring of authenticity. Directed evolution, however, takes advantage of robotics (to implement iterative cycles of random mutagenesis) and high-throughput screening technology (to detect fitness differences among numerous protein variants).

Rational design and directed evolution are not mutually exclusive approaches to protein engineering. Yet one approach or the other tends to predominate in the work of individual researchers. At least, that appears to be the case among the researchers who have been receiving accolades of late.

In one  method  approach, actors are encouraged to ask multiple  what if  questions of their characters and themselves to flesh out motivations and arrive at scenic truths. Seemingly inconsequential questions may end up being profound. Because the ultimate importance of any particular question is impossible to predict, the method may seem haphazard, but there is still a method to the, um, method.

A similar dynamic holds in directed evolution, if we accept the comments shared by Frances H. Arnold, Ph.D., a professor of chemical engineering, bioengineering, and biochemistry at the California Institute of Technology and the winner of the 2016 Millennium Technology Prize. Upon winning the Millennium Technology Prize, Dr. Arnold said that directed evolution  allows us to circumvent our inability to explain how mutations affect protein behavior, much less to predict beneficial ones. 

 The most beautiful, complex, and functional objects on the planet have been made by evolution,  she continued.  We can now use evolution to make things that no human knows how to design. Evolution is the most powerful engineering method in the world, and we should make use of it to find new biological solutions to problems. 

Dr. Arnold s innovations have revolutionized the slow and costly process of protein modification, and today her methods are being used in hundreds of laboratories and companies around the world. Modified proteins are used to replace processes that are expensive or that utilize fossil raw materials in the production of fuels, paper products, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and agricultural chemicals.

Because Dr. Arnold s work emphasizes green technology, it is a good fit for the Millennium Technology Prize, a Finnish prize that is awarded each year in recognition of innovators of technologies that promote sustainable development and a better quality of life.

Dr. Arnold s research group is pursuing several projects that harness the power of directed evolution or feature the recombination of protein blocks to arrive at to simplified (additive) sequence function relationships. Current projects include opsin engineering, structure-guided protein recombination, enzyme engineering for fuels and chemicals, expanding the chemistry of the flavocytochrome P450 BM3 through directed evolution, and engineering P450 BM3 for noninvasive imaging of neurotransmitters.

The Protein Society, which calls itself the premiere international society dedicated to supporting protein research, announced the winners of the 2016 Protein Society Awards back in July. Among the winners were researchers representing both kinds of protein engineering, both rational design and directed evolution.

The winner of the Protein Society s Christian B. Anfinsen Award, which recognizes  technological achievement or significant methodological advances in the field of protein science,  was awarded to Andreas Pl ckthun, Ph.D., director of the department of biochemistry at the University of Zurich. To achieve this distinction, Dr. Pl ckthun combined rigorous biophysical studies with the invention of new combinatorial and evolutionary technologies, which he then applied to the production of synthetic antibodies and G-protein-coupled receptors.

Dr. Pl ckthun s laboratory combined the Escherichia coli platform with ribosome display, a method of cell-free selection and evolution from very large libraries of whole proteins, to create a true in vitro protein evolution technology. Over the last few years, this technology has facilitated the development of repeat proteins as an alternative to antibodies.

 By using consensus engineering, libraries of repeat proteins have been designed from which specific, high-affinity binding proteins can be selected,  notes the laboratory s website.  Most of our work so far has concentrated on designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins).  These antibody mimetic proteins  are very stable and do not have disulfide bonds and therefore, unlike most antibodies, also work inside the cell. They can be prepared in very large amounts from E. coli, and show affinities up to the picomolar range. 

The directed evolution technology has also led to highly stable G-protein-coupled receptors that can be used for structural studies and in drug screening. Several engineered therapeutics, developed on the basis of his research, are now in late-phase clinical development.

The winner of the Protein Society s Stein and Moore Award, reserved for  leaders in protein science who have made sustained, high-impact research contributions to the field,  was Jane Clarke, Ph.D., a professor of molecular biophysics at the University of Cambridge. Her research is multidisciplinary, combining single-molecule and ensemble biophysical techniques with protein engineering and simulations to investigate protein folding, misfolding, and assembly.

Dr. Clarke s group studies families of proteins using a multidisciplinary approach, to shed light on the folding of related proteins, the folding of multidomain proteins, and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs). For example, Dr. Clarke s group compares the folding of a number of related proteins from large structural families to advance her investigations of the relationship between amino acid sequence and topology and protein stability.

Most proteins, her group points out, consist of a number of independently folding domains. Consequently, pertinent questions include the following: How do domain:domain interactions modulate the properties of the protein? How do larger, multidomain proteins avoid misfolding?

Finally, the many proteins that have large disordered segments are often involved in important signaling pathways. IDPs fold upon binding to a target. Going forward, Dr. Clarke s group will develop tools to study globular protein folding and investigate IDP folding mechanisms.

Film lore has it that Dustin Hoffman, true to his  method  ways, prepared to play a sleep-deprived character by actually neglecting to sleep. Hoffman s co-star, the more classically oriented Laurence Olivier, was moved to ask,  Why not try acting? It s much easier. 

If the story is true, the question was probably asked in jest, since classical acting, despite appearances, might actually require more work than method acting. (According to Wikipedia, classical acting integrates  the expression of the body, voice, imagination, personalizing, improvisation, external stimuli, and script analysis. ) Similarly, rational design may be more effortful than directed evolution. It s just that in rational design, much of the work is carried out by a computer. In fact, there can be so much work that even the most powerful computers can be overtasked.

Computers may be used to calculate all the atomic-level attractions and repulsions between a protein s constituent parts, as well as between the protein s constituent parts and the water molecules in the protein s vicinity. All the pushes and pulls, all the deflections and rebounds, and all the stretches and contractions, in aggregate, account for how a protein can start as an extruded sequence of linked amino acids and end as a warped, coiled, and folded three-dimensional structure, fit for a particular role.

This solution to the  protein-folding problem,  however, is itself a problem. It is a brute-force approach for which no amount of available computational power may suffice to see it through at least not until computers become considerably more powerful, or until the experimental data that is incorporated into computer models becomes much more finely grained, or both.

Rather than wait for such improvements, rational design is looking for computational shortcuts. Actually, it has already found one big shortcut, one that bypasses structural possibilities that are inconsistent with the co-evolution of amino acid pairs. This sort of co-evolution became apparent only after high-quality genome sequence data started to became available, making it possible to identify amino acid pairs that are distant from each other when the protein is unfolded, but are near to each other when the protein is in its active, three-dimensional form.

Amino acid co-evolution has been exploited in the work of David A. Baker, Ph.D., director of the Institute for Protein Design at the University of Washington. Dr. Baker might qualify as the Laurence Olivier of protein engineering since he is, in addition to being classically oriented, in possession of a mantle full of awards. Dr. Baker received young investigator awards from the National Science Foundation and the Beckman Foundation. He has also received and the Packard Foundation fellowship in Science and Engineering, the Irving Sigal Young Investigator award from the Protein Society, and the Overton Prize from the International Society of Computational Biology. He is a recipient of the Feynman Prize from the Foresight Institute, the AAAS Newcomb Cleveland prize, the Sackler prize in biophysics, and the Centenary award from the Biochemical Society.

His most recent distinction? His laboratory s work was recognized on the cover of the July 22 issue of Science magazine. This issue included a feature,  Rules of the Game,  which suggested that Dr. Baker s team had all but solved the protein-folding problem, and a report,  Accurate Design of Megadalton-Scale Two-Component Icosahedral Protein Complexes,  which described how Dr. Baker s team designed and assembled large protein nanocages that are similar to viral capsules and are, potentially, capable of serving as drug delivery platforms.

The Science feature indicated that Dr. Baker looks forward to going beyond  a strategy he refers to as  Neandertal protein design,  tweaking the genes for existing proteins to get them to do new things.  He was quoted directly as follows:  We were limited by what existed in nature. ... We can now short-cut evolution and design proteins to solve modern-day problems. 

Dr. Baker expressed similar sentiments in his commentary on his team s nanocage work:  As we pursue applications, we can design protein structures specifically for those applications, [without having to deal with] a lot of evolutionary baggage, of things evolving for one reason and then trying to adapt them for a new purpose.  In addition to pursuing applications, future work, he said, will focus on designing  more dynamic structures that undergo structural transitions in response to environmental changes.

This finding appeared August 17 in the journal Nature, in an article entitled,  Tumour Hypoxia Causes DNA Hypermethylation by Reducing TET Activity.  The article, which was contributed by scientists based at VIB (the Flanders Institute for Biotechnology)-KU Leuven, suggests that maintaining a proper oxygen supply within tumors could inhibit epigenetic aberrations that favor tumor growth. For example, new drugs could be developed that target blood vessels and enhance circulation. Alternatively, drugs could target the epigenetic aberrations directly.

 The activity of oxygen-dependent ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzymes is reduced by tumour hypoxia in human and mouse cells,  wrote the article s authors.  TET enzymes catalyse DNA demethylation through 5-methylcytosine oxidation. This reduction in activity occurs independently of hypoxia-associated alterations in TET expression, proliferation, metabolism, hypoxia-inducible factor activity or reactive oxygen species, and depends directly on oxygen shortage. 

Uncovering the link between oxygen shortage and tumor growth was the result of the analysis of over 3000 patient tumors. As a next step, the researchers verified another assumption: Would interfering with tumor oxygen supply strike a blow against the progression of cancer? They were pleased to see this hypothesis confirmed. Using mice, they proved that normalizing the blood supply is sufficient to stop the epigenetic alterations from occurring.

 Our data suggest that up to half of hypermethylation events are due to hypoxia, with these events conferring a selective advantage,  detailed the authors.  Accordingly, increased hypoxia in mouse breast tumours increases hypermethylation, while restoration of tumour oxygenation abrogates this effect. 

Although epigenetic changes don't affect the genetic code, they can strongly disturb gene function in a similar way, to the benefit of cancer cells. But until now, the origins of these epigenetic changes mostly remained a mystery.

""Our study shows that these epigenetic alterations are caused by the environment of the tumor, and more specifically by oxygen shortage, which we call  hypoxia,   said the VIB s Diether Lambrechts, who was a co-senior author of the current study  Oxygen is required by the enzymes that normally remove the methyl groups from the DNA. When there is oxygen shortage, too much methylation is retained, causing hypermethylation. Even more, hypoxia explains up to half of the hypermethylation in tumors. While we dedicated much of our efforts to breast tumors, we also demonstrated that this mechanism has a similarly broad impact in bladder, colorectal, head and neck, kidney, lung, and uterine tumors. 

The VIB lab is now testing whether analyzing tumor DNA can be used to predict tumor oxygenation. It is also engaged in new research that focuses on blood vessel normalizing therapies.

""Our new insights can have a potentially huge impact on cancer management,  explained the VIB s Bernard Thienpont, the other co-senior author of the current study.  First of all, we could use epigenetic aberrations to monitor the oxygen supply to a tumor, allowing us to better predict tumor behavior and make more informed treatment decisions. Secondly, it sheds new light on existing blood vessel targeting therapies. They don't only help deliver chemotherapy to the tumor, but also inhibit new epigenetic aberrations. This could in turn help make relapses less aggressive, and thus prove to be therapeutically beneficial. 

""We want to know whether it's not just possible to inhibit, but maybe even to reverse some of these epigenetic aberrations,  added Lambrechts.  Following through on these and other new research avenues gives us great faith in the future of cancer research.""","Pharmaceuticals"

 We characterized a specific population of nanoparticles derived from edible ginger (GDNPs 2) and demonstrated their efficient colon targeting following oral administration,  the authors wrote.  These nanoparticles contained high levels of lipids, a few proteins,  125 microRNAs (miRNAs), and large amounts of ginger bioactive constituents (6-gingerol and 6-shogaol). We also demonstrated that GDNPs 2 were mainly taken up by intestinal epithelial cells (IECs) and macrophages, and were nontoxic. 

The findings from this study were published recently in Biomaterials in an article entitled  Edible Ginger-derived Nanoparticles: A Novel Therapeutic Approach for the Prevention and Treatment of Inflammatory Bowel Disease and Colitis-associated Cancer. 

Each ginger-based nanoparticle was about 230 nanometers in diameter put into perspective, it would equate to more than 300 of them fitting across the width of a human hair. Using mouse models of IBD, the research team showed that the nanoparticles targeted the colon efficiently and were absorbed mainly by cells in the lining of the intestines, where inflammation from IBD occurs.

Additionally, the researchers described evidence that showed the particles reduced acute colitis and prevented chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer. Moreover, the particles enhanced intestinal repair by boosting the survival and proliferation of the cells that make up the lining of the colon, while concomitantly lowering the production of proteins that promote inflammation.

 Using different mouse colitis models, we showed that GDNPs 2 reduced acute colitis, enhanced intestinal repair, and prevented chronic colitis and colitis-associated cancer (CAC),  the authors remarked.  2-D fluorescence difference gel electrophoresis/mass spectrometry (2D-DIGE/MS) analyses further identified molecular target candidates of GDNPs 2 involved in these mouse models. Oral administration of GDNPs 2 increased the survival and proliferation of IECs and reduced the pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-  [tumor necrosis factor- ], IL[interleukin]-6, and IL-1 ), and increased the anti-inflammatory cytokines (IL-10 and IL-22) in colitis models, suggesting that GDNPs 2 has the potential to attenuate damaging factors while promoting the healing effect. 

The researchers hypothesize that part of the therapeutic effect comes from the high levels of lipids in the particles a result of the natural lipids in the ginger plant. The nanoparticles also retained key active constituents found naturally in ginger, such as 6-gingerol and 6-shogaol, which in previous studies have shown to be active against oxidation, inflammation, and cancer.

While ancient cultures have used ginger medicinally for centuries, and health food stores carry ginger-based supplements such as chews or the herb mixed with honey in a syrup as digestive aids, the authors of this new study surmise that delivering the ginger-derived compounds in a nanoparticle may be a more efficient way to target colon tissue than just providing the herb as a food or supplement. The advantage of ginger, say the researchers, is that it's nontoxic and could represent a very cost-effective source of medicine.","Pharmaceuticals"

TACTT3, which is being conducted in Europe, is studying acute and postacute inner ear tinnitus following traumatic cochlear injury or otitis media. The trial has enrolled more than 300 patients during the acute tinnitus stage (Stratum A) and approximately 330 patients during the postacute tinnitus stage (Stratum B). The primary endpoint is the change in tinnitus loudness from baseline to day 84; the change in the tinnitus functional index (TFI) is the key secondary efficacy outcome. Results from TACTT3 are expected later this year.

Keyzilen is a small-molecule N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. According to the company, evidence suggests that NMDA receptors in the cochlea play a major role in the occurrence of tinnitus following acute injury to the inner ear, e.g., from exposure to excessive noise, infections, disturbances in inner ear blood supply, or the administration of certain ototoxic drugs. Persistent overexpression of NMDA receptors may lead to pathologic excitation of auditory nerve fibers, which in the brain is perceived as tinnitus.","Pharmaceuticals"

Early-onset conduct problems (e.g., lying, fighting) and ADHD are the leading causes of child mental health referral in the U.K. These two disorders tend to occur in tandem (more than 40% of children with a diagnosis of conduct disorder also have a diagnosis of ADHD) and can also be traced back to very similar prenatal experiences such as maternal distress or poor nutrition.

In this new study of participants from the Bristol-based Children of the 90s cohort, 83 children with early-onset conduct problems were compared with 81 children who had low levels of conduct problems. The researchers assessed how the mothers' nutrition affected epigenetic changes (DNA methylation) of IGF2, a gene involved in fetal development and the brain development of areas implicated in ADHD, i.e., the cerebellum and hippocampus. Notably, DNA methylation of IGF2 had previously been found in children of mothers who were exposed to famine in The Netherlands during World War II.

The researchers from King's and Bristol found that poor prenatal nutrition, comprising high-fat and high-sugar diets of processed food and confectionary, was associated with higher IGF2 methylation in children with early-onset conduct problems and those with low levels of conduct problems.

Higher IGF2 methylation was also associated with higher ADHD symptoms between the ages of 7 and 13, but only for children who showed an early onset of conduct problems.

""Our finding that poor prenatal nutrition was associated with higher IGF2 methylation highlights the critical importance of a healthy diet during pregnancy,"" said Edward Barker, Ph.D., from King's College. ""These results suggest that promoting a healthy prenatal diet may ultimately lower ADHD symptoms and conduct problems in children. This is encouraging given that nutritional and epigenetic risk factors can be altered.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Phosphoinositides are critical cell-signal mediators present on the plasma membrane. The dynamic change of phosphoinositide concentrations on the membrane including clustering and declustering mediates signal transduction. The importance of phosphoinositides is scored by the fact that they participate in almost all cell-signaling events, and a defect in phosphoinositide metabolism is linked to multiple diseases including cancer, bipolar disorder, and type-2 diabetes. Optical sensors for visualizing phosphoinositide distribution can provide information on phosphoinositide dynamics. This exercise will ultimately afford a handle into understanding and manipulating cell-signaling processes. The major requirement in phosphoinositide sensor development is a selective, cell permeable probe that can quantify phosphoinositides. To address this requirement, we have developed short peptide-based ratiometric fluorescent sensors for imaging phosphoinositides. The sensors afford a selective response toward two crucial signaling phosphoinositides, phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) and phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI4P), over other anionic membrane phospholipids and soluble inositol phosphates. Dissociation constant values indicate up to 4 times higher probe affinity toward PI(4,5)P2 when compared to PI4P. Significantly, the sensors are readily cell-permeable and enter cells within 15 min of incubation as indicated by multiphoton excitation confocal microscopy. Furthermore, the sensors light up signaling phosphoinositides present both on the cell membrane and on organelle membranes near the perinuclear space, opening avenues for quantifying and monitoring phosphoinositide signaling.

Assays for phosphoinositides phosphates (PIP) have been constructed using PIP binding domains in cell lysates or expressed in cells. This paper describes a cell penetrating reporter peptide, which can act as cellular sensor of phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) (Figure 1). The peptide is based the protein gelsolin which has 20aa sequence known to bind PIP with particular selectivity toward PI(4,5)P2. To engineer a fluorophore into this sequence, a cysteine residue was introduced at Val59, which is a region of the peptide that interacts with membranes. A 2-dimethylamino-6-acyl-naphthalene (DAN) fluorophore was then coupled to Cys59. The DAN fluorophore undergoes a 60 70 nm shift in emission spectra (a change from green to blue emission) upon binding to membranes. Therefore, a ratiometric assay could be constructed by measuring the fluorescence of the PIP bound versus the unbound peptide (F450/F520 values were measured). Furthermore, DAN can be excited using two-photon microscopes using 780 nm light, which enables imaging of biological samples without confounding absorbance or autofluorescence from the sample. The affinity of the PIP sensor peptide was found to be in the 4 6  M range for PI(4,5)P2. In vitro studies using small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) were initially performed to confirm that the PIP sensor peptide responded to different concentrations of PI(4,5)P2 content in membranes. A shorter DAN-13aa sensor was found to be capable of measuring PI(4,5)P2 localization in HEK293 cells. Variation of this peptide could improve the selectivity of this probe and potentially expand to other PIP species.

This two-step strategy occurred to scientists based at the University of California, Berkeley. They began by considering a long-standing puzzle: Why do some sgRNAs work well, setting up the Cas9 nuclease to cut and disable a gene nearly 100% of the time, while other sgRNAs bind to DNA but seldom or never knock out a gene?

The scientific director of UC Berkeley s Innovative Genomics Initiative, Jacob Corn, Ph.D., suspected that Cas9's occasionally poor cutting efficiency might be related to how DNA is repaired, since DNA repair mechanisms the enzymatic corner men that fix any breaks or deletions in the DNA that might lead to a deadly mutation differ from cell to cell. Dr. Corn reasoned that random strands of DNA none of them similar to any actual human DNA (that is, nonhomologous) might confuse the repair process and improve the knockout success rate.

""It gives the cell a little kick to prevent normal repair from happening,"" said Dr. Corn.

He portrays CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing as a competition between cutting and DNA repair: once Cas9 cuts, the cell exactly replaces the cut DNA, which Cas9 cuts again, in an endless cycle of cut and repair until the repair enzymes make a mistake and the gene ends up dysfunctional. Perhaps, he speculated, the oligonucleotides decrease the fidelity of the repair process, or make the cell switch to a more error-prone repair that allows Cas9 to  break the gene more readily.

Dr. Corn is the senior author of an article ( Non-homologous DNA Increases Gene Disruption Efficiency by Altering DNA Repair Outcomes ) that appeared August 17 in the journal Nature Communications. The article describes how the two-step gene knockout strategy increased knockout efficiency by as much as five times.

 Non-homologous single-stranded DNA greatly stimulates Cas9-mediated gene disruption in the absence of homology-directed repair,  wrote the article s authors.  This stimulation increases the frequency of clones with homozygous gene disruptions and rescues otherwise ineffective sgRNAs. 

The authors added that the molecular outcome of enhanced gene disruption depends upon cellular context,  stimulating deletion of genomic sequence or insertion of non-homologous DNA at the edited locus in a cell line specific manner.  Most important: ""Non-homologous DNA appears to divert cells towards error-prone instead of error-free repair pathways, dramatically increasing the frequency of gene disruption.""

""It turns out that if you do something really simple just feed cells inexpensive synthetic oligonucleotides that have no homology anywhere in the human genome the rates of editing go up as much as five times,"" asserted Dr. Corn. The technique boosts the efficiency of all CRISPR/Cas9s, even those that initially failed to work at all.

With higher efficiency, researchers will have better success at creating the knockouts they want, and then using those knockout cell lines to explore the function of a gene or a group of genes. Because most long-lived cell lines are derived from cancer cells including the very popular HeLa cell line these cell lines typically have more than the normal two copies of each gene. This can make it difficult to knock out all copies at once, and higher efficiency greatly increases the chance of success.

High efficiency also is essential when knocking out genes to correct hereditary mutations in humans. Physicians have speculated about knocking out genes that make people susceptible to infectious diseases, such as AIDS, or prone to autoimmune, inflammatory, or neurodegenerative disorders. It remains to be seen whether the approach described by Dr. Corn and colleagues could be used in a therapeutic context, but it is very effective for research purposes.

Dr. Corn and colleagues also intend to take advantage of the peculiarities of DNA repair to improve sequence insertion, so that a defective gene can be replaced with a normal gene, and possibly cure a genetic disease.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Want to Survive Ebola? Perhaps Malaria Infection Can Help?","

While close to 15% of patients died from the malaria infections, at the time this treatment course was deemed preferable to the almost-certain death from syphilis.

Now, a study led by scientists from National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) found that people infected with Ebola virus were 20% more likely to survive if they were co-infected with malaria-causing Plasmodium parasites. Moreover, higher parasitemias (percentage of parasites in the blood) correlated with increased rates of Ebola survival. Though the scientists are not advocating deliberate infections with malaria as Dr. Wagner-Jauregg did, they are hopeful that their study will open up much need avenues of research in dealing with highly virulent microbial pathogens such as Ebola.

The findings from this study were published recently in Clinical Infectious Diseases in an article entitled  Plasmodium Parasitemia Associated With Increased Survival in Ebola Virus Infected Patients. 

At a joint diagnostic laboratory established in Liberia by the NIH and the CDC, the scientists tested 1868 blood samples taken from individuals seeking care for possible Ebola virus infection at the M decins Sans Fronti res ELWA3 Ebola treatment unit in Monrovia. Testing confirmed Ebola virus infection in 1182 samples, of which 956 were tested for Plasmodium parasites, resulting in 185 positives.

Amazingly, 58% with co-infections survived, compared to 46% who were infected with Ebola virus alone. Furthermore, those with the highest parasitemia levels showed an 83% survival rate.

Antimalarial drugs were routinely administered to all patients seen at the treatment unit during the Ebola outbreak. However, the investigators claimed that it had no bearing on the increased survival in Plasmodium-infected patients in the study. This evidence was supported by separate experiments conducted in the U.S., where treatment with antimalarials did not affect survival in laboratory mice infected with Ebola virus.

The research team is now in the process of pinpointing a mechanism that could explain the association between Plasmodium infection and surviving an Ebola infection with the hope of uncovering new treatment modalities.

 Plasmodium species parasitemia is associated with an increase in the probability of surviving Ebola virus infection,  the authors concluded.  More research is needed to understand the molecular mechanism underlying this remarkable phenomenon and translate it into treatment options for Ebola virus infection. ","Pharmaceuticals"

In fact, phosphorylating a specific spot on the protein called S421 protected a mouse model of Huntington's from developing symptoms of the disease.

""I was shocked at the profound effect phosphorylation had on the Huntington's model mice,"" said first author Ian Kratter, M.D., Ph.D., a former graduate student at Gladstone and the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF). ""They showed few signs of the motor dysfunction, depression, or anxiety that are characteristic of the disease. In most of our tests, they were virtually indistinguishable from healthy mice.""

The mice were also protected against neuron death, particularly in the striatum, the movement and reward center of the brain that is first affected in Huntington's disease. The scientists think that phosphorylation enables neurons to remove more of the harmful protein so it does not accumulate and damage the cell.

""Phosphorylation helps control how proteins fold and the systems in cells that clear proteins,"" explained Dr. Finkbeiner, who is a senior investigator at Gladstone. ""This is exciting, because a lot of the work we've done points to these protein removal pathways as being important not only for Huntington's disease, but also for other neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding how phosphorylation links to these pathways could help treat several different brain diseases.""

The researchers are now exploring ways to mimic the effects of phosphorylation with a drug.

A spate of recent announcements shows how closely state officials, industry and academic leaders, and entrepreneurs have followed that advice.

Since June alone, MilliporeSigma announced plans for a $115 million R&D campus in Burlington, MA, replacing its site in Billerica, MA, while Pfizer broke ground on a $200 million biologics clinical manufacturing facility in Andover, MA. Merck & Co. and Takeda Pharmaceutical said they will expand R&D in Cambridge. GE Healthcare Life Sciences opened its North American headquarters in Marlborough, MA, while its corporate parent signaled its interest in building a new corporate HQ at Boston s Fort Point.

Zumutor, a developer of monoclonal antibodies, is establishing business development operations in Woburn, MA, while keeping its R&D in Bangalore. Another recent arrival, Eurofins Lancaster Laboratories, has expanded into the state by opening its first northeastern office at the Cambridge Innovation Center.

 Other clusters have strengths and weaknesses, but none of them have the innovation that we have here,  Matthew Powers, an evp with JLL who leads the commercial real estate firm s New England Life Sciences practice, told GEN.  Not only do you have employees, you have academic institutions. You have what I like to call industry inertia, since all these companies come here and stay and build off of the innovation that underpins the cluster. You have the full spectrum of a pipeline, so you have startups through mature companies. ","Pharmaceuticals"

A particularly challenging biochemical symphony, one that included movements in both RNA synthesis and RNA replication, had been played through, possibly for the first time in four billion years.

According to a study that appeared August 15 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), scientists based at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) created a ribozyme that succeeded in replicating short lengths of RNA efficiently, and in performing transcription on even longer RNAs to make functional RNA molecules with complex structures. This virtuoso performance comes close to what scientists imagine an  RNA World  RNA replicator would have been capable of doing to support life before modern biology, where protein enzymes now handle gene replication and transcription.

The study, which was led by TSRI s Gerald F. Joyce, Ph.D., and David P. Horning, Ph.D., culminated in the PNAS article, which was entitled,  Amplification of RNA by an RNA Polymerase Ribozyme.  The article describes how the TSRI scientists used test-tube evolution techniques to tackle the decades-old challenge of creating an enzyme that could both replicate and transcribe RNA and thus support an RNA world.

The team started with an enzyme that had been developed and improved upon by other researchers since the early 1990s. The class I RNA polymerase ribozyme, as it has come to be known, can perform the basic task of RNA synthesis required for transcribing an RNA template into a functional RNA molecule by binding to a strand of RNA and using it as a template to stitch together a complementary RNA strand.

The team reported that it developed an improved polymerase ribozyme that can synthesize a variety of complex structured RNAs, including aptamers, ribozymes, and, in low yield, even transfer RNA (tRNA).

 The polymerase can replicate nucleic acids, amplifying short RNA templates by more than 10,000-fold in an RNA-catalyzed form of the PCR,  wrote the authors of the PNAS article.  Thus, the two prerequisites of Darwinian life the replication of genetic information and its conversion into functional molecules can now be accomplished with RNA in the complete absence of proteins. 

Prior forms of the ribozyme had been very limited in the RNA sequences they could handle and couldn't transcribe RNAs that have even moderately complex structures. Because of those limitations, they also could not perform full replication of RNA, which requires the transcription of a complementary strand back into a copy of the original.

""We found that the new ribozyme can handle most sequences and all but the most difficult structures, so we can use it to make a variety of functional RNA molecules,"" said Dr. Joyce.

Even when synthesizing the limited RNA sequences that the original class I RNA polymerase ribozyme could handle, the improved ribozyme, called 24-3, proved capable of stitching them together about 100 times faster than its ancestor could.

Turning to the much harder task of replication, the TSRI researchers found that ribozyme 24-3 could copy RNAs of up to two dozen nucleotides, achieving what biologists call ""exponential replication"" and creating as many as 40,000 copies of a target RNA within 24 hours.

The 24-3 ribozyme is thus the first ever to combine the two basic capabilities RNA synthesis and RNA replication necessary for a pre-protein, pre-DNA world of RNA life.

To generate and sustain a true ""RNA world,"" the new ribozyme will have to be improved further to enable the replication of longer, more complex RNA molecules crucially including the polymerase ribozyme itself. The Joyce laboratory is now driving its ribozyme toward that goal with further test-tube evolution experiments.

""A polymerase ribozyme that achieves exponential amplification of itself will meet the criteria for being alive,"" Dr. Joyce concluded. ""That's a summit that's now within sight.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, visible light, as detected by the human eye, represents an array of colors of various wavelengths. The evidence is continuing to mount suggesting that particular wavelengths affect sleep and wakefulness states within the brain.

Now, investigators led by scientists at Oxford University have published results from a recent study that shows blue light wavelengths keep mice awake longer, whereas green light wavelengths put them to sleep more easily. The researchers are hopeful that this new information will not only provide new insight into sleep and sleep disorders but could also have potential implications in future lighting designs.

For mice, which are mostly nocturnal, light is a sleep-inducer. Previous studies in mice and humans have shown that nonimage-forming light perception occurs, in particular photosensitive cells in the eye and involves a light sensor called melanopsin. Mice without melanopsin (Opn4 / ) show a delay in their response to falling asleep when exposed to light, pointing to a critical role for melanopsin in sleep regulation.

The Oxford researchers wanted to investigate this phenomenon further by studying sleep induction in mice exposed to colored light, i.e., the light of different wavelengths. On the basis of the physical properties of melanopsin, which is most sensitive to blue light, the researchers hypothesized that blue light would be the most potent sleep inducer.

However, much to their amazement, the scientist found that green light puts mice to sleep quickly, whereas blue light seems to stimulate the mice, although they did fall asleep eventually. Mice lacking melanopsin were oblivious to light color, demonstrating that the protein is directing the differential response.

 We assessed the effects of light of different wavelengths on behaviourally defined sleep,  the authors wrote.  Here, we show that blue light (470 nm) causes behavioural arousal, elevating corticosterone and delaying sleep onset. By contrast, green light (530 nm) produces rapid sleep induction. Compared to wildtype mice, these responses are altered in melanopsin-deficient mice (Opn4 / ), resulting in enhanced sleep in response to blue light but delayed sleep induction in response to green or white light. 

The findings from this study were published recently in PLOS Biology in the article ""Melanopsin Regulates Both Sleep-Promoting and Arousal-Promoting Responses to Light. 

Additionally, the researchers found that both green and blue light elevated levels of the stress hormone corticosterone in the blood of exposed mice compared with mice kept in the dark. However, corticosterone levels in response to blue light were higher than levels in mice exposed to green light. Interestingly, when the researchers gave the mice drugs that blocked the effects of corticosterone, they were able to mitigate the effects of blue light drugged mice exposed to blue light went to sleep faster than control mice that had received placebos.

The Oxford team feel this work adds the growing body of data concerning the effect of colored lights  on humans. For instance, previous work has shown that exposure to blue light a predominant component of light emitted by computer and smartphone screens recapitulates arousal and wakefulness in humans, as it does in mice.

""Despite the differences between nocturnal and diurnal species, light may play a similar alerting role in mice as has been shown in humans,  the authors remarked. Overall, the authors say their work ""shows the extent to which light affects our physiology and has significant implications for the design and use of artificial light sources.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The study (""A Genome-Editing Strategy to Treat  -Hemoglobinopathies That Recapitulates a Mutation Associated with a Benign Genetic Condition""), which appears online in Nature Medicine, provides proof-of-principle for a new approach to treat common blood disorders by genome editing, according to the investigators.

 

 ""Our approach to gene editing is informed by the known benefits of hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin,"" said Mitchell J. Weiss, M.D., Ph.D., chair of the St. Jude Department of Hematology and one of the study's lead authors. ""It has been known for some time that individuals with genetic mutations that persistently elevate fetal hemoglobin are resistant to the symptoms of sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia, genetic forms of severe anemia that are common in many regions of the world. We have found a way to use CRISPR gene editing to produce similar benefits.""

 

 Fetal and adult hemoglobin are two different molecular forms of the essential oxygen-carrying molecule in red blood cells. Hemoglobins are made up of different combinations of four molecular subunits. Sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia are caused by mutations in a gene encoding the adult-expressed  -subunit. Disease becomes apparent after birth as the levels of adult hemoglobin take hold and levels of fetal hemoglobin decline. These mutations can affect the survival of red blood cells and inhibit oxygen delivery to tissues, causing impaired function of different organs with devastating consequences for patients.

 

 Fetal hemoglobin lacks  -subunits and has  -subunits instead. Thus,  -thalassemia or sickle cell disease associated mutations, which impair the production or function of the  -subunit, do not cause problems with fetal hemoglobin, which can transport oxygen effectively in adults.

 

 Experts have known for some time that inhibiting or reversing "" -to- "" switching of hemoglobin subunits can raise levels of fetal hemoglobin in adults and significantly ameliorate the debilitating symptoms of  -thalassemia or sickle cell disease.

 

 ""Our work has identified a potential DNA target for genome editing mediated therapy and offers proof-of-principle for a possible approach to treat sickle cell and  -thalassemia,"" added Dr. Weiss. ""We have been able to snip that DNA target using CRISPR, remove a short segment in a control section of DNA that stimulates  -to-  switching, and join the ends back up to produce sustained elevation of fetal hemoglobin levels in adult red blood cells.""

 

 When the scientists edited the DNA of blood-forming stem cells derived from patients with sickle cell disease, they were able to activate those genes and produce red blood cells that had enough fetal hemoglobin to be healthy.

 

 Recently, scientists have used several gene-editing approaches to manipulate blood-forming stem cells for the possible treatment of sickle cell disease and  -thalassemia, including repair of specific disease-causing mutations and other strategies to inhibit  -to-  switching. All of these approaches remain untested in patients.

""Our results represent an additional approach to these existing innovative strategies and compare favorably in terms of the levels of fetal hemoglobin that are produced by our experimental system,"" said Dr. Weiss. Using genome editing to restore the hereditary persistence of fetal hemoglobin is an attractive possibility, because it can be achieved relatively easily using current technologies. The condition is known to be benign in people who inherit similar naturally occurring mutations.

 

 The researchers want to refine the gene-editing process further and perform other experiments to minimize potentially harmful off-target mutations before in-human clinical trials are considered.

The young researcher, Duo An, is currently a doctoral student in the laboratories of Dan Luo, Ph.D., and Minglin Ma, Ph.D., both of the Department of Biological and Environmental Engineering at Cornell. When he was a summer intern, An was making nanoclay hydrogels, injecting one solution into another to create a gel. But during one particular procedure, instead of direct injection, he dripped one solution into another. When the first solution entered the second, it created vortex-ring particles.

Eventually, it occurred to An that the vortex-ring particles, or tiny donuts, could be more useful than anyone might have imagined, especially if they contained, well, a filling not a fruit filling, as in a donut for human consumption, but a filling that would help the hydrogel donuts  hit the spot  in biotechnology applications as varied as cell encapsulation, three-dimensional cell culture, and cell-free protein production.

These possibilities were outlined in an article that appeared August 4 in the journal Nature Communications. The article,  Mass Production of Shaped Particles Through Vortex Ring Freezing,  describes how stable hydrogel or solid microparticles of a defined shape can be produced through a gelation or precipitation process. ( Freezing  in the article s title may be read as  gelation. )

According to the article, which was contributed by a group of scientists led by Drs. Luo and Ma, controlling the shape and speed of a fluid spray, as well as the speed of the chemical reaction within the spray s droplets, could yield different structures.

 During its formation, the fluid experiences a rich variety of intriguing geometrical intermediates from spherical to toroidal,  wrote the article s authors.  Here we show that these constantly changing intermediates can be  frozen  at controlled time points into particles with various unusual and unprecedented shapes. 

The Cornell researchers exploited their electrospraying technique to mass produce inorganic and organic particles, with their sizes well controlled from hundreds of microns to millimeters. Multitudes of vortex ring-derived particles (VRPs) were produced, up to 15,000 rings per minute, then frozen at precise time points.

 Guided further by theoretical analyses and a laminar multiphase fluid flow simulation, we show that this freezing approach is applicable to a broad range of materials from organic polysaccharides to inorganic nanoparticles,  the authors continued.  Moreover, compartmentalization and ordered-structures composed of these novel particles are all achieved, creating opportunities to engineer more sophisticated hierarchical materials. 

Dr. Ma admitted that the concept of using a doughnut-shaped encapsulation hadn't occurred to him, but made perfect sense: ""We knew the concept that a doughnut shape is better, but we never thought of making it until we saw it [from An].""

An advantage of the doughnut-shaped encapsulation over a spherical-shaped one is shorter diffusion distance the distance the encapsulated particle must travel to escape the capsule while at the same time maintaining a relatively large surface area.

This concept could pave the way for other as-yet-unknown applications of vortex ring freezing, according to Dr. Luo. For example, the Cornell scientists employed nanoclay hydrogel donut-microVRPs to encapsulate DNA molecules for improved cell-free protein production. The group s previous work had shown that the bulk nanoclay hydrogel protects DNA from DNase and hence enhances the cell-free protein production yield. Compared with a bulk nanoclay hydrogel, the donut-microVRP have a much higher surface area for mass transfer and are therefore ideal for protein production applications.

""Our hope is that this type of material in these shapes can be used much more extensively in other labs for whatever they're trying to do,"" noted Dr. Luo. ""There is a whole field devoted to just particles, but by default, they are all thinking in terms of spherical particles. Hopefully, this will add to that field of study.""","Pharmaceuticals"

A greater understanding of these defensive pathways would allow scientists to develop therapies that could precisely modulate the immune response in the treatment of virulent pathogens.

Now, immunologists at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital have identified the protein trigger in the body's quick-reaction innate immune system that specifically recognizes the influenza virus in infected cells and triggers their death. The researchers believe that the protein they identified called ZBP1 could provide much-needed hope for developing drugs to protect against influenza's sometimes lethal complication of pneumonia.

Viral pneumonia from influenza is often exacerbated by lung inflammation and cell damage caused by an overreaction of the innate immune system. The development of new therapies that would modulate ZBP1's action could allow the body to fight the virus by killing infected cells, but preventing that overreaction.

In the new study, the investigators sought to understand how the body's innate immune system is alerted to the presence of the virus and mobilizes to trigger infected cells to commit suicide. The innate immune system triggers the body's ""emergency response"" to invaders such as infections. This rapid attack gives the body's adaptive immune system time to generate antibodies that specifically target the virus or bacterium. Flu vaccines train this adaptive immune system to attack specific viral strains.

First, the research team uncovered the specific machinery that the innate immune system uses to induce cell suicide as controlled by type I interferon. Subsequently, the researchers began to search for the protein molecule that recognizes the virus and triggers the cell death machinery. Their experiments used cells from genetically altered mouse strains, in which genes for particular proteins are removed selectively, to discover whether the cells lacking that protein would commit suicide when infected with influenza.

Amazingly, they found that cells lacking ZBP1 were completely resistant to viral-induced cell death. The result was surprising because ZBP1 was known to sense foreign DNA in the cell, but the influenza virus uses RNA as its genetic material.

""Our discovery was totally unexpected,"" explained senior study author Thirumala-Devi Kanneganti, Ph.D., a member of the St. Jude Department of Immunology. ""We never thought we would actually identify this molecule to be important in influenza viral infection because there is no DNA stage in the influenza life cycle.""

Further experiments revealed that ZBP1 was, indeed, a ""master assassin"" in the cell, responsible for triggering three separate cell-death pathways. Moreover, the team discovered that ZBP1 was particular for recognizing influenza. The sensor did not trigger cell death in response to other similar viruses or bacteria

The findings from this study were published recently in Science Immunology in an article entitled  ZBP1/DAI Is an Innate Sensor of Influenza Virus Triggering the NLRP3 Inflammasome and Programmed Cell Death Pathways. 

The St. Jude s team work also revealed that ZBP1 acts as a protein detector, not a DNA detector, sensing telltale viral-produced proteins in the infected cell. The scientists moved their studies into Zbp1-knockout mice strains infected with influenza. Due to the fact that the innate immune system wasn't killing off infected cells, the mice showed an increased viral load and delayed recovery. However, because the immune system wasn't able to overreact, the mice showed reduced lung inflammation and damage to lung cells and were protected from mortality.

""Since the pathology that we saw in the mice matches what is seen in humans, we will now explore translating these findings to humans,"" Dr. Kanneganti noted. ""If we can somehow modulate the activation of this pathway, then that will help to decrease the exaggerated inflammatory response that causes mortality during influenza infection.""

Lead author Teneema Kuriakose, Ph.D., a postdoctoral research associate in Dr. Kanneganti s laboratory, added that the timing of such drug treatment would be extremely critical, stating that  ZBP1 does an amazing job of killing off infected cells, but it would be very useful to modulate ZBP1 in later stages of the infection, when the uncontrolled inflammation causes damage.""

""We have shown that these molecules are important in viral infections, but now we want to test their role in other inflammatory conditions,"" Dr. Kanneganti concluded. ""ZBP1 is likely not dedicated to attacking only the influenza virus.

Their study (""Amine Synthesis via Iron Catalysed Reductive Coupling of Nitroarenes with Alkyl Halides"") is published in Nature Communications.

The amines are one of the most important classes of chemical compounds today. Amines that contain a ring-like aryl group are used widely in pharmaceuticals, such as the top-selling drugs Abilify    (aripiprazole), Crestor  (rosuvastatin), Gleevec  (imatinib mesylate), and Lidoderm  (lidocaine patch 5%). The process of making different amines (amination) involves connecting an amine to an organic molecule. The amine itself must first be prepared in advance by the hydrogenation of anilines, which are used as a nitrogen source and are derived from nitroarenes.

Xile Hu, Ph.D., and Chi Wai Cheung, Ph.D., at EPFL developed a technique for making (hetero)aryl amines through the reductive coupling of nitroarenes with organic compounds, without needing to go through the aniline step first. Using an iron catalyst, the researchers were able to couple amines to a number of alkyl halides, a group of organic compounds widely used in commercial products.

 The method was shown to have a high tolerance to functional groups, including some that require protection under conventional amine synthesis, making them versatile and well suited for a broad range of applications, according to the investigators.

The new method allows chemists to synthesize alkyl or aryl amines directly from nitroarenes, which are often cheaper than anilines. Moreover, using nitroarenes directly is more step-economical than using anilines, because the latter have to be derived from nitroarenes anyway, add the scientists. In addition, certain anilines containing are difficult to produce, while their corresponding nitroarenes are readily available.

""From these points of view, the current method can be considered as a valuable alternative to the conventional amination methods such as direct alkylation and reductive amination,"" said Dr.Hu.","Pharmaceuticals"

ProNAi said it incurred a one-time $2.8 million restructuring charge toward estimated close-out expenses for PNT2258.

The restructuring comes two months after the company revealed in June that PNT2258 showed only modest efficacy in the Phase II Wolverine trial, assessing the candidate in 61 patients with relapsed or refractory (r/r) diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

ProNAi immediately suspended development of PNT2258 in DLBCL, after interim results showed a response rate of 8.1% overall and 15.8% in a subgroup of 19 patients with a performance status of 0-1, who were exposed to one to three prior systemic regimens and received at least eight doses of PNT2258 within 35 days of starting therapy. No response was seen in 10 patients with a performance status of 2 and/or four or more prior lines of therapy enrolled before the eligibility criteria were amended, nor in eight additional patients enrolled after the April 25 data cutoff date for the interim analysis.

PNT2258 won the FDA s Orphan Drug Designation for DLBCL in March, and earlier received a similar designation from the European Commission.

ProNai has shifted its R&D focus to advancing PNT141, a selective, oral small-molecule inhibitor of the Cdc7 kinase. According to ProNAi, PNT141 is a key regulator of both DNA replication and DNA damage response, making it a compelling emerging target for the potential treatment of a broad range of tumor types.

Legend has it the song was inspired by shortages another banana variety, the Gros Michel. Like the Cavendish, the Gros Michel was genetically uniform and vulnerable to blight. Ultimately it was taken out of cultivation, even though it was widely considered tastier than the Cavendish.

Could the Cavendish avoid the fate of the Gros Michel? Maybe, with the help of gene-sequencing technology, which has been used to unravel the DNA of P. fijiensis. Gene sequencing has also been used to discover how P. fijiensis and two closely related pathogens, P. musae and P. eumusae, have evolved into a lethal threat to the world s bananas. P. musae causes yellow sigatoka disease, and P. eumusae causes eumasae leaf spot disease. Of the three pathogens, P. fijiensis poses the greatest constraint to banana production worldwide.

By studying the genomes of these pathogenic fungi, scientists hope to find ways to ensure the sustainable production of the banana, the world s leading fruit crop. At present, the banana ranks fourth as a global staple food, with 140 million tons of bananas produced annually in subtropical and tropical regions. The banana industry could, however, be wiped out in just 5 10 years by fast-advancing fungal diseases. Already, the Sigatoka disease complex can reduce banana yields by 50 70%, if not controlled.

Genomic details of the pathogens threatening the banana appeared August 11 in the journal PLOS Genetics, in an article entitled,  Combating a Global Threat to a Clonal Crop: Banana Black Sigatoka Pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis (Synonym Mycosphaerella fijiensis) Genomes Reveal Clues for Disease Control."" The article, which was contributed by scientists based at the University of California (UC) Davis, and Wageningen University, suggested genomic insights could suggest ways to improve host resistance. Such insights could also inform sophisticated management of fungicide resistance in the pathogen.

 In the P. fijiensis genome sequence, we identified an effector that induced an HR [hypersensitive response]-like necrosis on a resistant banana accession but not on a susceptible cultivar,  wrote the article s authors.  If validated, this assay may be useful for identifying resistance in banana breeding programs. 

The authors also reported that the genomic sequence was used to develop highly polymorphic molecular markers for analyzing P. fijiensis field populations and to identify a strong enrichment (nearly 100%) for fungicide resistance markers in fungicide-treated banana plantations compared to untreated wild-type populations.  This rapid evolution of fungicide resistance poses an immediate threat to sustainable banana production,  the authors noted. They added, however, that the P. fijiensis genome could aid in developing fungicide treatment schedules to combat the black sigatoka pathogen and in improving the efficiency of banana breeding programs.

Black sigatoka is airborne and affects the leaves of banana plants in small- and large-scale plantations, and without chemical control it results in huge yield losses. The disease also reduces the quality of the fruit, causing premature ripening.

""Black sigatoka has a huge social, ecological, and economic impact worldwide,  explained Gert Kema, professor in tropical phytopathology at Wageningen University.  Thanks to the sequencing of the DNA of the Pseudocercospora fungus, we are now gaining a greater insight into the interaction between the fungus and the banana plant. This provides us with leads for increasing the sustainability of banana cultivation, making it better for the environment, the local population, and the economy. For example, the insights offer us opportunities to develop a banana plant that is suitable for production and export, and which is also resistant against black sigatoka.""

This fresh understanding of the DNA of the black sigatoka fungus is also providing new information that is useful in the development of more effective and, hopefully, less environmentally unfriendly crop protection products. This could reduce the amount of fungicide spraying, which, in turn, would improve the quality of life of the people working in the plantations and those who live in the immediate surroundings.

""We have discovered that the two more destructive pathogens share a pattern of parallel changes in their core metabolic pathways that enables them to exploit more efficiently the nutrient resources available in banana,"" added UC Davis molecular plant pathologist Ioannis Stergiopoulos. ""Now, for the first time, we understand the genomic basis of the evolution of virulence in these fungal diseases, thus giving us an opportunity for intervention.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Now, scientists at the University of Cambridge found that CMV alters gene expression in the tomato plants it infects, causing changes to volatile airborne chemicals the scent emitted by the plants.

Most interestingly, the researchers found that bees could smell these subtle changes, as glasshouse experiments have shown that bumblebees prefer the infected plants over healthy ones. The Cambridge team believes that by indirectly manipulating bee behavior to improve pollination of infected plants by changing their scent, the virus is effectively paying its host back. Yet, this is not an altruistic mechanism, because it seemingly aids the spread of the pollen to susceptible plants, inhibiting the chance of virus-resistant plant strains emerging.

The authors of this new study, which was published recently in PLOS Pathogens in an article entitled  Virus Infection of Plants Alters Pollinator Preference: A Payback for Susceptible Hosts?  say that understanding the smells that attract bees, and reproducing these artificially by using similar chemical blends, may enable growers to protect or even enhance yields of bee-pollinated crops.

""Bees provide a vital pollination service in the production of three-quarters of the world's food crops. With their numbers in rapid decline, scientists have been searching for ways to harness pollinator power to boost agricultural yields,"" explained senior study author John Carr, Ph.D., head of Cambridge's virology and molecular plant pathology group. ""Better understanding the natural chemicals that attract bees could provide ways of enhancing pollination and attracting bees to good sources of pollen and nectar which they need for survival.""

CMV, typically transmitted by aphids and not by bees, is one of the most prevalent pathogens affecting tomato plants, resulting in small plants with poor-tasting fruits that can cause serious losses to cultivated crops. Not only is CMV one of the most damaging viruses for horticultural crops, but it also persists in wild plant populations, and the authors say their results suggest why.

""We were surprised that bees liked the smell of the plants infected with the virus it made no sense,  remarked Dr. Carr.  You'd think the pollinators would prefer a healthy plant. However, modeling suggested that if pollinators were biased toward diseased plants in the wild, this could short-circuit natural selection for disease resistance. 

""The virus is rewarding disease-susceptible plants,  he added,  and at the same time producing new hosts it can infect to prevent itself from going extinct. An example, perhaps, of what's known as symbiotic mutualism.""

The investigators describe findings that reveal a new level of complexity in the evolutionary  arms race  between plants and viruses, in which it is traditionally believed that plants continually evolve new forms of disease-resistance while viruses evolve new ways to evade it.

""We would expect the plants susceptible to disease to suffer, but in making them more attractive to pollinators the virus gives these plants an advantage,  noted Dr. Carr.  Our results suggest that the picture of a plant-pathogen arms race is more complex than previously thought, and in some cases, we should think of viruses in a more positive way. 

The blend of volatile organic compounds that plants emit has evolved to perform multiple functions, attracting pollinators and repulsing plant-eating animals and microbes. In the current study, the Cambridge team grew plants in individual containers and collected air with emissions from CMV-infected plants, as well as mock-infected control plants. Using mass spectrometry, the researchers could see the change in emissions induced by the virus. More importantly, they found that bumblebees could smell the changes.

""Bees are far more sensitive to the blends of volatiles emitted by plants and can detect very subtle differences in the mix of chemicals,  Dr. Carr stated.  In fact, they can even be trained to detect traces of chemicals emitted by synthetic substances, including explosives and drugs. 

Finally, the researchers used mathematical modeling to show how pollinator bias for infected plants can cause genes for disease susceptibility to persist in plant populations over vast numbers of generations. With the global population estimated to reach nine billion people by 2050, producing enough food will be one of this century's greatest challenges. The researchers hope that their work will help address issues surrounding food security at local, national, and international scales.","Pharmaceuticals"

These so-called induced pluripotent stem cells won Yamanaka the Nobel Prize in medicine just 6 years later for their promise in research and medicine. Since then, researchers have discovered other ways to convert cells between different types. This is mostly done by introducing many extra copies of ""master switch"" genes that produce proteins that turn on entire genetic networks responsible for producing a particular cell type.

Now the Duke team has developed a strategy that avoids the need for the extra gene copies. Instead, a modification of the CRISPR genetic engineering technique is used to directly turn on the natural copies already present in the genome. These early results indicate that the newly converted neuronal cells show a more complete and persistent conversion than the method where new genes are permanently added to the genome. These cells could be used for modeling neurological disorders, discovering new therapeutics, developing personalized medicines, and, perhaps in the future, implementing cell therapy.

The study (""Targeted Epigenetic Remodeling of Endogenous Loci by CRISPR/Cas9-Based Transcriptional Activators Directly Converts Fibroblasts to Neuronal Cells"") is published in Cell Stem Cell.

""This technique has many applications for science and medicine. For example, we might have a general idea of how most people's neurons will respond to a drug, but we don't know how your particular neurons with your particular genetics will respond,"" said Charles Gersbach, Ph.D., the Rooney Family Associate Professor of Biomedical Engineering and director for the Center of Biomolecular and Tissue Engineering at Duke. ""Taking biopsies of your brain to test your neurons is not an option. But if we could take a skin cell from your arm, turn it into a neuron, and then treat it with various drug combinations, we could determine an optimal personalized therapy.""

""The challenge is efficiently generating neurons that are stable and have a genetic programming that looks like your real neurons,"" says Joshua Black, the graduate student in Gersbach's lab who led the work. ""That has been a major obstacle in this area.""

In the 1950s, Conrad Waddington, Ph.D., a British developmental biologist who laid the foundations for developmental biology, suggested that immature stem cells differentiating into specific types of adult cells can be thought of as rolling down the side of a ridged mountain into one of many valleys. With each path a cell takes down a particular slope, its options for its final destination become more limited.

If you want to change that destination, one option is to push the cell vertically back up the mountain. That's the idea behind reprogramming cells to be induced pluripotent stem cells. Another option is to push it horizontally up and over a hill and directly into another valley.

""If you have the ability to specifically turn on all the neuron genes, maybe you don't have to go back up the hill,"" said Dr. Gersbach.

Previous methods have accomplished this by introducing viruses that inject extra copies of genes to produce a large number of master transcription factors. Unique to each cell type, these proteins bind to thousands of places in the genome, turning on that cell type's particular gene network. This method, however, has some drawbacks.

""Rather than using a virus to permanently introduce new copies of existing genes, it would be desirable to provide a temporary signal that changes the cell type in a stable way,"" said Black. ""However, doing so in an efficient manner might require making very specific changes to the genetic program of the cell.""

In the new study, Black, Dr. Gersbach, and colleagues used CRISPR to precisely activate the three genes that naturally produce the master transcription factors that control the neuronal gene network, rather than having a virus introduce extra copies of those genes.

The CRISPR system was administered to mouse fibroblasts in the laboratory. The tests showed that, once activated by CRISPR, the three neuronal master transcription factor genes robustly activated neuronal genes. This caused the fibroblasts to conduct electrical signals--a hallmark of neuronal cells. And even after the CRISPR activators went away, the cells retained their neuronal properties.

""When blasting cells with master transcription factors made by viruses, it's possible to make cells that behave like neurons,"" said Dr. Gersbach. ""But if they truly have become autonomously functioning neurons, then they shouldn't require the continuous presence of that external stimulus.""

The experiments showed that the new CRISPR technique produced neuronal cells with an epigenetic program at the target genes matching the neuronal markings naturally found in mouse brain tissue.

""The method that introduces extra genetic copies with the virus produces a lot of the transcription factors, but very little is being made from the native copies of these genes,"" explained Black. ""In contrast, the CRISPR approach isn't making as many transcription factors overall, but they're all being produced from the normal chromosomal position, which is a powerful difference since they are stably activated. We're flipping the epigenetic switch to convert cell types rather than driving them to do so synthetically.""

The next steps, according to Black, are to extend the method to human cells, raise the efficiency of the technique, and try to clear other epigenetic hurdles so that it could be applied to model particular diseases.

""In the future, you can imagine making neurons and implanting them in the brain to treat Parkinson's disease or other neurodegenerative conditions,"" said Dr. Gersbach. ""But even if we don't get that far, you can do a lot with these in the lab to help develop better therapies.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Dr. Subramanian along with Dr. Umar Saif, chairman of the Punjab Information Technology Board, and a team of computer researchers were able to find the signal in the noise from more than 300,000 phone calls about dengue, a virus that is similar in transmission to Zika.

Those calls were to a health hotline set up to improve the surveillance and response times following a 2011 dengue epidemic in the densely populated province of Punjab. In that outbreak 21,000 cases were reported and more than 350 lives lost.

The team created a working dashboard that not only flags outbreaks but also provides an accurate forecast by location two to three weeks ahead of time.

 If you give a signal to a hospital two weeks before an outbreak, it s a big deal,  Dr. Subramanian says. Their results were published in Science Advances.

Hospitals in that region use that lead time to prepare special wards and prevent patient-to-patient spread of the infection and public health officials are able to implement targeted containment activities. The researchers plan to publish follow up data on these efforts.  So far the results have been promising,  he says.

Another study also on dengue transmission in Pakistan published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Science, found predictive clues in much bigger data more than 40 million mobile phone records. Dengue has been prevalent for decades in the southern port city of Karachi, but newly emerging outbreaks in the northeast provided researchers with the opportunity to analyze how and when the disease spreads in a wired world.

The researchers were able to generate fine-scale dynamic risk maps with direct application to dengue containment and epidemic preparedness.

 Mobile phone data provide dynamic population mobility estimates that can be combined with infectious disease surveillance data and seasonally varying environmental data to map these changing patterns of vulnerability,  says author Dr. Caroline Buckee, assistant professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in the study.","Pharmaceuticals"

Approximately one dozen genes have variants that are associated with sociability, or with fear and aggression.

The gene variants were uncovered by researchers based at Nationwide Children s Hospital. According to these researchers, reduced-fear gene variants may have been involved in the domestication process. The researchers also assert that their findings are relevant not only to dog behavioral problems, but also to human anxiety disorders.

The new findings appeared August 8 in the journal BMC Genetics, in an article entitled,  Genetic Mapping of Canine Fear and Aggression.  In the near term, the findings could inform genetic tests that would reveal the risk of specific types of fear and aggression in dogs. In the long term, the findings could shed light on human anxiety disorders and aggression, violence, and criminality.

 We conducted genome-wide association (GWA) mapping of breed stereotypes for many fear and aggression traits across several hundred dogs from diverse breeds,  wrote the article s authors.  We confirmed those findings using GWA in a second cohort of partially overlapping breeds. Lastly, we used the validated loci to create a model that effectively predicted fear and aggression stereotypes in a third group of dog breeds that were not involved in the mapping studies. 

The researchers found that known loci variants (IGF1 and HMGA2) for small body size are associated with separation anxiety, touch sensitivity, owner-directed aggression, and dog rivalry. The researchers also notice that two other loci (between GNAT3 and CD36 on chromosome 18, and near IGSF1 on the X chromosome) are associated with several traits, including touch sensitivity, nonsocial fear, and fear and aggression that are directed toward unfamiliar dogs and humans.

""Our strongest focus is on specific genes related to aggression toward unfamiliar humans and dogs, which are associated with highly relevant genes at two genome regions,"" said Carlos Alvarez, Ph.D., principal investigator in the Center for Molecular and Human Genetics in The Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital. ""Those genes are consistent with the core fear and aggression neural pathway known as the amygdala to hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis.""

Because these risk variants are common across dog breeds, the canine veterinary setting provides an ideal test bed for new therapies targeting those biochemical pathways. Once it is determined which neuronal circuits are affected by the risk variation, this will likely reveal drug targets that could be inhibited or activated to increase or decrease the emotional behavioral effects. Those findings can immediately be tested in pet dog patients under owner consent. And, if those therapies are effective in dogs, they can then be applied to humans with similar conditions. Knowledge of the affected pathways will also provide biomarkers that can be used to identify the patients who are most likely to respond to such treatments.

""This project has only just begun,"" noted Dr. Alvarez. ""We are continuing to identify and validate other genes associated with these traits, including the expansion of dog breeds studied and biological validation of the findings. We are excited about what this work will continue to uncover.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet, can it be true that various microbes that constitute the oral microbiota negatively affect colorectal cancer (CRC)? A new study led by researchers at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has found evidence strongly suggesting that they can.

While some previous evidence alluded to common mouth bacteria worsening CRC in animals, it had not been clear how these microbes made their way to the gut to exert their adverse effects. In the new study, the Harvard investigators found evidence that microbes called fusobacteria might use the bloodstream to reach colorectal tumors. Moreover, the research team was able to show exactly how these bacteria home in on colorectal tumors causing them to proliferate and subsequently accelerate colorectal cancer.

""As fusobacteria contribute to colon tumor development, revealing the mechanism that guides them to the tumor and why fusobacteria become abundant there might inform ways of blocking this,"" explained co-senior study author Wendy Garrett, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of immunology and infectious diseases at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and the Dana-Farber Cancer Center. ""Alternatively, and perhaps more importantly, if we know how fusobacteria localize and become enriched in colon tumors, hopefully, we can utilize the same or similar mechanisms to guide and deliver cancer therapeutics to colon tumors.""

CRC is the third leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the United States, and microbes have recently begun to emerge as key factors influencing the development and progression of the disease. Recent studies have shown that fusobacteria promote the formation of colon tumors in animals and are enriched in human colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. But these studies left it unclear how bacteria from the mouth localize to, and become abundant in, colorectal tumors.

The research team had a suspicion that oral microbes might reach colorectal tumors through the bloodstream. To test this idea, the scientists injected fusobacteria into the tail veins of two mouse models with either precancerous or malignant colorectal tumors. Surprisingly, in both types of mice, the fusobacteria became enriched in colorectal tumors compared to adjacent normal tissue. The researchers also detected fusobacteria in the majority of human colorectal cancer metastases tested, but not in most samples taken from tumor-free liver biopsies.

The findings from this study were published recently in Cell Host & Microbe in an article entitled  Fap2 Mediates Fusobacterium nucleatum Colorectal Adenocarcinoma Enrichment by Binding to Tumor-Expressed Gal-GalNAc. 

Using human samples and mouse models, the researchers went on to discover that the Fap2 protein located on the surface of fusobacteria recognizes a sugar called Gal-GalNac, which is abundant on the surface of colorectal tumor cells.

 We identify a host polysaccharide and fusobacterial lectin that explicates fusobacteria abundance in CRC,  the authors wrote.  Gal-GalNAc, which is overexpressed in CRC, is recognized by fusobacterial Fap2, which functions as a Gal-GalNAc lectin. 

Additional experiments showed that Fap2 mediates fusobacterial colonization of colorectal cancer tumors and metastases. Recent studies have demonstrated that this protein also impairs the ability of the host immune system to kill tumor cells. Taken together, the findings suggest that fusobacteria travel through the bloodstream to reach colorectal tumors and then use their Fap2 protein to bind to host cells and proliferate in tumors, thereby accelerating colorectal cancer.

 F. nucleatum binding to clinical adenocarcinomas correlates with Gal-GalNAc expression and is reduced upon O-glycanase treatment,  the authors wrote.  Clinical fusobacteria strains naturally lacking Fap2 or inactivated Fap2 mutants show reduced binding to Gal-GalNAc-expressing CRC cells and established CRCs in mice. 

""The strengths are that the study involved both human samples and mouse models. The weakness is that the available mouse models for colorectal adenocarcinoma do not completely reflect the slowly developing disease in humans,"" noted co-senior study author Gilad Bachrach, Ph.D., associate professor in the Institute of Dental Sciences at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. ""Based on our findings, it's too early to say whether we can prevent mouth bacteria from traveling through blood to the colon and promoting tumor formation or if some people are more at risk than others.""

In future studies, the researchers will look to examine further how fusobacteria contribute to the development, growth, and spread of colorectal cancer. ""Although it may not be possible to prevent oral microbes from entering the bloodstream and reaching colorectal tumors, our findings suggest that drugs targeting either Fap2 or Gal-GalNac could potentially prevent these bacteria from exacerbating colorectal cancer,"" Dr. Garrett concluded.","Pharmaceuticals"

The deal is designed to expand Mallinckrodt s hospital products portfolio with developmental products that include the StrataGraft  regenerative skin tissue and a technology platform for genetically enhanced skin tissues.

StrataGraft is being developed as the first biological ""off-the-shelf"" skin substitute product for treatment of severe, deep, partial-thickness burns an alternative to current standard of care for second- and third-degree burns, which requires autograft.

StrataGraft is in Phase III development for treatment of severe, deep, partial-thickness burns, with an FDA approval decision anticipated by 2020. The product is also in Phase II development for treatment of severe, full-thickness burns. StrataGraft received the FDA s orphan designation in 2012.

Mallinckrodt and Stratatech added that the technology platform offers the potential for new products through topically applied, genetically enhanced tissues designed to produce elevated levels of natural wound healing and antimicrobial factors. The platform is in Phase I development in diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers, with other potential applications under consideration.

 We believe Stratatech's technology has the potential to transform the standard of treatment for wound care. Additionally, the acquisition will bring world-class Stratatech researchers with deep expertise in cell-based, differentiated regenerative medicine to Mallinckrodt's research team,  Mallinckrodt CEO and President Mark Trudeau said in a statement.

Mallinckrodt reasons that Stratatech s progenitor keratinocyte technology platform provides potential for new products through genetically enhanced tissues, applied topically, that produce elevated levels of natural wound healing and antimicrobial factors.  StrataGraft is in Phase I development in diabetic foot and venous leg ulcers, with other potential applications being considered.

 In our next phase of development, the unique cell line used to produce living tissue in StrataGraft can also be genetically modified to potentially increase production of a variety of factors to support and promote wound healing, such as antimicrobial and vascular endothelial growth factors. This could offer utility in a number of skin injury settings beyond burns,  added Stratatech CEO Lynn Allen-Hoffmann, Ph.D.

Dr. Allan-Hoffman founded privately held Stratatech in 2001, telling GEN 8 years later that she was inspired to pursue tissue engineering while watching a patient with third-degree burns covering 95% of his body receive painful grafts of his own skin:  That was my epiphany day, when I refocused my efforts to develop a cell line that could be clinically useful. 

Mallinckrodt said its planned acquisition of StrataSys will result in  slight  dilution to the company's near- and longer-term adjusted diluted earnings per share. However, the buyer did not offer guidance concerning the effect of the deal on its GAAP diluted EPS  due to the inherent difficulty of forecasting the timing or amount of items that would be included in calculating such impact.

""This could allow us to investigate questions such as why some people genetically predisposed to a disease are protected from it? Why events during early life and adolescence have such a lasting impact on brain health? Is it possible to 'reset' gene expression in the human brain?""

Histone deacetylases (HDAC) are important regulators of gene transcription, and one group of HDACs has been linked to important brain disorders. Several established neuropsychiatric drugs are HDAC inhibitors, and others are currently being studied as potential treatment for Alzheimer's disease and Huntington's disease. Martinostat was developed in Dr. Hooker's laboratory and is patterned after known HDAC inhibitors to bind to HDAC molecules tightly in the brain.

PET scans with Martinostat of the brains of eight healthy human volunteers revealed characteristic patterns of uptake, reflecting HDAC expression levels, that were consistent among all participants. HDAC expression was almost twice as high in gray matter as in white matter. Within gray matter structures, uptake was highest in the hippocampus and amygdala and lowest in the putamen and cerebellum. Experiments with brain tissues from humans and baboons confirmed Martinostat's binding to HDAC, and studies with neural progenitor stem cells revealed specific genes regulated by this group of HDACs, many of which are known to be important in brain health and disease.

""HDAC dysregulation has been implicated in a growing number of brain diseases, so being able to study HDAC regulation both in the normal brain and through the progression of disease should help us better understand disease processes,"" says Dr. Hooker, who is an associate professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School.

Yet, again in recent decades science has impressed upon our fragile egocentric minds that there are literally billions of microorganisms living on and within our bodies exerting an enormous, if not imperceptible, amount of influence on all of our systems. These communities composed primarily of bacteria outnumber all of the cells of the human body and work symbiotically with our systems, like a harmonious Lilliputian army hell-bent on keeping Gulliver running in tip-top shape.

Yet, as is often the case during various times in our lives, our biological systems run amok caused from either the relatively benign like an infection from a microbial pathogen, not unlike those that constitute our microbiomes, or from our cells turning against the collective and branching out on their own accord. It has come to the attention of many scientists in recent years that many of these biological perturbations have a link to the microbiome, either directly or indirectly. Even seemingly distant and somewhat disconnected systems such as the brain and the lumen of the intestinal tract have become inextricably linked to disorders like multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer s disease, autism, and mood disorders.

Although killer T cells are known to give cancer cells a pass early in tumor development, it is unclear whether they wink at driver mutations from the start, or whether they surveil these genetic aberrations before turning a blind eye. According to new research from the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, killer T cells are vigilant at first, but soon become inattentive. This finding raises the possibility that killer T cells could regain their sense of mission, enhancing the effectiveness of immunotherapies against cancer.

The new research appeared August 9 in the journal Immunity, in an article entitled,  Tumor-Specific T Cell Dysfunction Is a Dynamic Antigen-Driven Differentiation Program Initiated Early during Tumorigenesis.  This article describes how preclinical cancers were studied in mice to reveal the killer T-cell response. The killer T cells, the article explained, not only recognize changes that drive cancer, they also attempt to launch an immune attack on cancerous cells.

 Early during the pre-malignant phase of tumorigenesis, TST [tumor-specific CD8+ T] cells became dysfunctional, exhibiting phenotypic, functional, and transcriptional features similar to dysfunctional T cells isolated from late-stage human tumors,  wrote the article s authors.  Thus, T cell dysfunction seen in advanced human cancers may already be established early during tumorigenesis. Although the TST cell dysfunctional state was initially therapeutically reversible, it ultimately evolved into a fixed state. 

The authors added that persistent antigen exposure, rather than factors associated with the tumor microenvironment, drove dysfunction. Moreover, the authors indicated that TST cell differentiation and dysfunction program exhibited features distinct from T-cell exhaustion in chronic infections.

""Our results highlight that driver mutations, which theoretically would be the most effective antigens to target because they represent the basis for a tumor behaving as a tumor, are not immunologically silent and can indeed be recognized,"" said Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center immunologist Phil Greenberg, M.D., who led the study along with Andrea Schietinger, Ph.D., a former Fred Hutch postdoctoral research fellow who now leads an immunotherapy lab at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.

"Malaria Transmission Significantly Reduced Using Human Odor-Baited Traps"," 
	 
 
	 The use of a newly developed mosquito trap incorporating human odor has resulted in a 70% decline in the population of the most significant malaria mosquito on the Kenyan island of Rusinga. After the introduction of the odor-baited traps on the island, the proportion of people with malaria was 30% lower among those living in houses with a trap compared to people living in houses who were yet to receive a trap.  ","http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/malaria-transmission-significantly-reduced-using-human-odor-baited-traps/81253075/","NA","NA","Malaria Transmission Significantly Reduced Using Human Odor Baited Traps | News Highlights That makes combating malaria increasingly tricky and less environmentally friendly,  Dr. Takken continued.  Alternative methods are therefore urgently needed. As we use a natural lure namely human odor in our approach there is no negative impact on the environment, and it is very improbable that the mosquitoes will become 'resistant' to being captured. After all, the mosquitoes need their attraction to the lure in order to be able to survive.""

The findings from this new study were published recently in The Lancet in an article entitled  The Effect of Mass Mosquito Trapping on Malaria Transmission and Disease burden (SolarMal): A Stepped-Wedge Cluster-Randomised Trial. 

The success of the new malaria control approach lies in its combinatorial strategy of using the odor-baited traps with mosquito nets, antimalaria drugs, and a solid social strategy. The traps require electricity to operate, but there is no central power supply on Rusinga, an island in Lake Victoria, so solar panels were installed on the roofs of homes. These not only provided electricity for the mosquito traps but also provided the homes with power for light and to charge a mobile phone. The use of solar energy to control malaria gave rise to the project name: SolarMal.

Thanks to this combined approach, all 25,000 inhabitants of Rusinga participated in the study. When the odor-baited traps are used, the use of insecticides to combat the mosquito population can be minimized avoiding any harmful side effects of such products. The Wageningen antimalaria approach, therefore, has had not only benefits in reducing the spread of malaria but also had positive effects on the living conditions of the population.

While the mortality rate due to malaria infections especially in children under the age of five still rank the disease as one of the leading causes of death worldwide, it is the morbidity associated with malaria that often gets overlooked, costing Africa $12 billion a year in health-care costs and lost productivity, particularly in the agricultural sector.

""The effect of the disease on agricultural production is hugely underestimated,"" Dr. Takken noted. ""As children with malaria need access to hospital care, their parents cannot work on the land and as a result food production rates decline. If those parents themselves also suffer from malaria infections four or five times a year, they are also not able to work for around 6 weeks. In such cases, extra labor needs to be brought in, or the crop will be lost. An African household loses 10% of its annual incomes through malaria. It is for good reason that reducing the prevalence of malaria was included in the ten-millennium development goals formulated by the UN.""

The World Health Organization (WHO) is aiming to eradicate malaria by 2030. To that end, investments are being made in the development of vaccines against the parasite and in combating the vectors of the parasite: the mosquitoes. The odor-baited trap dubbed the Suna trap represents an efficient and safe solution in the fight against the mosquito.","Pharmaceuticals"

""We have figured out a way to mine these data for the benefit of cancer patients.""

Dr. Okimoto and collaborators developed a computational algorithm called the Joint Analysis of Many Matrices by ITeration (JAMMIT), which uses advanced mathematics to identify different patterns across multiple molecular data types, such as gene expression and genetic mutations, that when taken together accurately predict what treatments would be best for a given cancer patient.

""The algorithm could accelerate the approval of powerful treatments for many cancers, improve clinical outcomes, and reduce costs for treating cancer. I believe this discovery can open a path to more precision medicine clinical trials that could be initated and run locally in Hawaii,"" said Randall Holcombe, M.D., incoming Director of the UH Cancer Center.

The findings (""Joint Analysis of Multiple High-Dimensional Data Types Using Sparse Matrix Approximations of Rank-1 with Applications to Ovarian and Liver Cancer""), published in Biodata Mining, highlight JAMMIT analysis of ovarian and liver cancer data pulled from private research labs and public databases such as The Cancer Genome Atlas. The analysis identified small sets of genes that accurately predict which patients would benefit most from chemotherapy. These same signatures also suggest that many of the ovarian and liver cancer patients studied would benefit from combining chemotherapy with immunotherapy. Dr. Okimoto plans on analyzing the data for dozens of more cancers.

The liver cancer results were based in part on tissue samples collected locally by the liver cancer working group (TeamLiver), which includes about 15 researchers and physicians from the Cancer Center and local hospitals that make up the Hawaii Cancer Consortium collaborating on liver cancer research for more than 4 years. Hawaii has one of the highest rates of liver cancer in the nation and the second highest liver cancer mortality rate in the U.S.","Pharmaceuticals"

Overweight mice treated with these nanoparticles lost 10% of their body weight over 25 days  without showing any negative side effects.

The drugs work by transforming white adipose tissue, which is made of fat-storing cells, into brown adipose tissue, which burns fat. The drugs also stimulate the growth of new blood vessels in fat tissue, which positively reinforces the nanoparticle targeting and aids in the white-to-brown transformation.

These drugs, which are not FDA approved to treat obesity, are not new, but the research team developed a novel method to deliver them so that they accumulate in fatty tissues, helping to avoid unwanted side effects in other parts of the body.

""The advantage here is now you have a way of targeting it [the drug] to a particular area and not giving the body systemic effects. You can get the positive effects that you'd want in terms of antiobesity but not the negative ones that sometimes occur,"" says Robert Langer, Sc.D., the David H. Koch Institute Professor at MIT and a member of MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.

Dr. Langer and his colleagues have shown that promoting angiogenesis can help transform adipose tissue and lead to weight loss in mice. However, drugs that promote angiogenesis can be harmful to the rest of the body.

To try to overcome these harmful effects, Dr. Langer and Omid Farokhzad, M.D., director of the Laboratory of Nanomedicine and Biomaterials at Brigham and Women's Hospital, turned to the nanoparticle drug-delivery strategy they have developed in recent years to treat cancer and other diseases. By targeting these particles to the disease site, they say they can deliver a powerful dose while minimizing the drug's accumulation in other areas.

The researchers designed the particles to carry the drugs in their hydrophobic cores, bound to a polymer known as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA), which is used in many other drug-delivery particles and medical devices. They packaged two different drugs within the particles rosiglitazone, which has been approved to treat diabetes but is not widely used due to adverse side effects, and an analog of prostaglandin. Both drugs activate the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR), which stimulates angiogenesis and adipose transformation.

The outer shell of the nanoparticles consists of a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) polymer embedded with targeting molecules that guide the particles to the correct destination. These targeting molecules bind to proteins found in the lining of the blood vessels that surround adipose tissue.

The researchers tested the particles in mice that had become obese after being fed a high-fat diet. The mice lost about 10% of their body weight, and their levels of cholesterol and triglycerides  also dropped. The mice also became more sensitive to insulin. (Obesity often leads to insulin insensitivity, which is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes). The mice did not show any side effects from the treatment, which was delivered every other day for 25 days.

With the current system, the particles are injected intravenously, which could make this approach suitable for morbidly obese patients who are at significant risk of obesity-related diseases, says Dr. Farokhzad. ""For it to be more broadly applicable for treatment of obesity, we have to come up with easier ways to administer these targeted nanoparticles, such as orally,"" he says.

The challenge to delivering nanoparticles orally is that it is difficult for them to penetrate the lining of the intestines. In a previous study, however, Drs. Langer and Farokhzad developed a nanoparticle coated with antibodies that bind to receptors found on surfaces of cells lining the intestine, allowing the nanoparticles to be absorbed through the digestive tract. More recently, Dr. Farokhzad and colleagues have developed another orally delivered nanoparticle that uses transferrin, a protein involved in the transport of iron in the body, to facilitate active transport of nanoparticles across the intestine.

The researchers also hope to find more specific adipose tissue targets for the nanoparticles, which could further reduce the possibility of side effects, and they may also investigate using other drugs with lower toxicity.","Pharmaceuticals"

Selumetinib is also under study for adjuvant treatment of patients with stage III or IV differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC), for which the treatment received the FDA s Orphan Drug Designation in May, and in patients with neurofibromatosis type 1.

AstraZeneca said it remained committed to developing selumetinib, including in Phase III trials in patients with DTC, and in a U.S. National Cancer Institute-sponsored Phase II registration trial in pediatric neurofibromatosis type 1 patients.

AstraZeneca acquired exclusive worldwide rights to selumetinib from Array BioPharma in 2003 in return for the pharma giant agreeing to pay Array $10 million upfront, research funding, potential development milestones of over $85 million, depending upon the number of successfully commercialized products, and royalties on product sales.","Pharmaceuticals"

Now scientists at the Wellcome Trust, Novartis Research Foundation (GNF), Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases (NITD), University of York, University of Washington, and the University of Glasgow have identified a chemical that can cure three of these neglected diseases in mice Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Additionally, the newly developed compound does not harm human cells in laboratory tests, providing a strong starting point for drug development.

""We found that these parasites harbor a common weakness,  explained senior study author Frantisek Supek, Ph.D., research investigator at GNF.  We hope to exploit this weakness to discover and develop a single class of drugs for all three diseases.""

Chagas disease, leishmaniasis, and human African trypanosomiasis affect 20 million people worldwide and lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually. These eukaryotic parasites commonly referred to as kinetoplastids  share similar biology and genetics, which led the researchers to think it possible to find a single chemical that could destroy all three. The research team uncovered an enzyme common to all three parasites and developed a chemical that binds to the ""target,"" preventing it from functioning.

As part of the research, three million compounds held in the Novartis chemical library were tested by a phenotypic screen against live parasites and the most active were then modified over 3000 times using synthetic chemistry before the most potent one was identified  a compound called GNF6702.

""It's a breakthrough in our understanding of the parasites that cause the three diseases, potentially allowing them to be cured,  noted co-author Jeremy Mottram, Ph.D., chair in pathogen biology at the Centre for Immunology and Infection within the University of York. ""This early-phase drug discovery project will now move toward toxicity testing prior to human trials.""

The findings from this study were published recently in Nature in an article entitled  Proteasome Inhibition for Treatment of Leishmaniasis, Chagas Disease, and Sleeping Sickness. 

Much of the research was performed using in vivo imaging technology and initially focused on human African trypanosomiasis, a disease found in sub-Saharan Africa and transmitted by the tsetse fly. The disease gets its more common name from the disturbance of the sleep cycle caused by the protozoan parasites Trypanosoma brucei infecting the brain, causing victims to fall into a coma and die.

Finding a drug that can target the disease in the brain has always been a challenge for scientists, but the research team believes they have made a breakthrough using an animal model of the human disease.

""We were able to detect the parasite in the brain using an imaging system that detects the presence of genetically modified light-emitting parasites,  remarked co-author Elmarie Myburgh, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the department of biology at the University of York. ""We then tested the chemical developed by Novartis using our imaging method, which showed that it could get into the brain and kill the parasites.""

""It is a great example of collaboration between industry and academic partners,  Dr. Myburgh added.  By combining resources and expertise, you can really make significant scientific progress.""

Existing treatments for the three diseases are expensive, often have side effects, and are not very effective. The fact that GNF6702 does not seem to have any adverse effects in mice suggests that it might have fewer side effects than existing drugs, although this will need to be explored in human studies. GNF6702 is now being tested for toxicity before it can be moved into clinical trials.

""These three diseases lead to more than 50,000 deaths annually, yet they receive relatively little funding for research and drug development,  stated Stephen Caddick, Ph.D., director of innovation at the Wellcome Trust.  We hope that our early-stage support for this research will provide a basis for the development of new treatments that could reduce suffering for millions of people in the poorest regions of the world.""","Pharmaceuticals"

This switch, this manifestation of a phenomenon called alternative splicing (AS), has been known to occur in mammals. But it is also, as has been recently discovered, something that occurs in planarians, invertebrate organisms that split off from the ancestors of mammals around 600 million years ago.

The new find comes from an international team of scientists. In collaboration with Jordi Solana and Nikolaus Rajewsky and other colleagues from the Max Delbr ck Center for Molecular Medicine in the Helmholtz Association (MDC) in Germany and the University of Toronto, Manuel Irimia, a group leader at the Center for Genomic Regulation, examined the shifting patterns of gene activity in stem cells in planarians and reported their results in the journal eLife. Their paper, entitled,  Conserved Functional Antagonism of CELF and MBNL Proteins Controls Stem Cell-Specific Alternative Splicing in Planarians,  appeared August 9.

The scientists noted how curious it is that a stem-cell-specific AS mechanism should be shared across such a wide evolutionary range. The scientists suggested that the mechanism must be very ancient, and that it may be equally important as transcription factors are for giving animal stem cells their unique properties.

 We studied AS in a powerful in vivo model for stem cell biology, the planarian Schmidtea mediterranea,"" wrote the article s authors. ""We discover a conserved AS program comprising hundreds of alternative exons, microexons and introns that is differentially regulated in planarian stem cells, and comprehensively identify its regulators. 

The researchers identified splicing processes that operate only in the stem cells of the worms, and identified numerous alternative exons responsible for stem-cell-specific protein variants. Surprisingly, introns were often not removed from the RNA, which meant that no more functioning proteins could be generated. The researchers also found small exon snippets, ""micro exons,"" in fully developed cells.

In subsequent experiments, the scientists switched off the proteins that control AS. One of these proteins is MBNL, which suppresses the production of stem-cell-specific protein variants. They also discovered that the CELF protein counteracts MBNL by stimulating the production of these variants. During development from a stem cell to a tissue cell, the two factors competed for predominance. This interaction between MBNL and CELF has been previously described only in mammalian cells.

""In our study we identified new mechanisms that we weren't aware of from the usual studies into mammalian stem cells. With this knowledge, it's now possible for us to look in a targeted manner for the same processes in human cells,"" said Solana.

""I found it particularly fascinating that it's impossible to understand how MBNL without knowing about the function of CELF,  observed group leader Prof. Nikolaus Rajewsky, who is an expert on the systems biology of RNA.  Maybe other splicing factors compete or cooperate in a similar way.""

The scientists' work also raises fundamental questions about the function of stem cells in animals. ""To find the antagonism between MBNL and CELF in flatworms is interesting from an evolutionary biologist's perspective,  noted Solana.  For the first time, we described mechanisms in stem cells in organisms from extremely distant branches of the evolutionary tree.

Pharming said the deal would accelerate its shift into a profitable specialty pharmaceutical company, with its own independent commercial infrastructure that will underpin future growth.

Ruconest, developed by Pharming, is approved in the U.S. and the EU for the treatment of acute hereditary angioedema (HAE) attacks. The drug has generated annualized net product sales of approximately $25 million as of the end of the second quarter, within a market Pharming said is valued at about $700 million.

Pharming reasons that it can enter another $700 million market if it can win approval for an additional indication. On July 18, Pharming trumpeted positive results in a Phase II trial of Ruconest for prophylaxis of HAE, with the drug meeting its primary endpoints for both once-weekly and twice-weekly dosing regimens.

Pharming agreed to pay Valeant $60 million upfront upon closing of the deal, which is expected in the fourth quarter of this year, and up to $65 million in potential payments tied to achieving sales milestones.

The acquisition will be funded through a combination of straight debt and new equity capital of between $80 million and $100 million, the buyer added.

Pharming said it expects Valeant s 11-member Ruconest sales force will join the buyer and continue selling the drug in the U.S. That sales force will be increased, the company said, with Pharming also planning to spend more on medical science liaison personnel and additional marketing activities, including patient advocacy programs and  significant  unconditional support for the U.S. Hereditary Angioedema Association, its programs, and other HAE centers of excellence in the U.S.

Also planned, Pharming added, is additional spending to make Ruconest available in Canada and Mexico, as well as generating more sales in the E.U., Middle East, and Africa markets that Pharming will take over from Sobi in October.

The deal has already completed prenotification and clearance procedures under the Hart Scott Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act 1976, Pharming said.

Pharming said it anticipates that the deal will add to its 2016 earnings, and enable the company to reach profitability as much as 3 years earlier than under the license with Valeant.

Valeant acquired North American rights to Ruconest when it acquired Salix Pharmaceuticals last year, in a deal completed April 1, 2015. Salix previously acquired those rights by acquiring Santarus, with which Pharming entered into an agreement in 2010 covering development and commercialization of Ruconest  in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico.","Pharmaceuticals"

Through the genome-editing medicine collaboration, Adverum could generate at least $1 million upfront, plus millions more in potential option fees, milestone payments, and royalties.

The companies did not detail which eye diseases they were targeting with new treatments, except to say they were  inherited retinal diseases.  In an investor presentation last month, Editas disclosed two eye disorders Leber congenital amaurosis 10 and ocular herpes simplex virus (HSV) within its range of disease applications for CRISPR-based medicines.

Under the companies  Collaboration, Option, and License Agreement, Editas agreed to pay Adverum a $1 million upfront  fee  to evaluate Adverum vectors for use in clinical development, plus an additional option exercise fee of $1 million for an exclusive license to Adverum s next-generation AAV vectors for use in each indication chosen as part of the collaboration.

The companies said they plan to conduct research focused on the testing and optimizing Adverum s AAV vectors for potential Editas genome-editing products for the indications. Editas agreed to fund all preclinical activities related to the collaboration, with an unspecified part of the upfront fee to be credited against that funding.

Editas may exercise its option to develop a first indication until the first anniversary of the collaboration. Editas has until the third anniversary to exercise options for the four other Indications but the latter option would expire by the end of the second anniversary if Editas hasn t pursued an initial indication by then, Adverum stated in a regulatory filing.

For each option Editas exercises, Adverum will be eligible to receive up to a  mid-teen million  dollar amount in development and commercialization milestone payments for the product, plus tiered royalties between the mid-single digits and low teens on net sales, subject to adjustments, Adverum s filing added.

If Editas opts to develop a therapy by using a designated alternative vector, Adverum would receive smaller development milestone payments and tiered royalties for the product.

Editas  latest collaboration is its third in as many weeks. On August 3, the company said it will license from Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH) intellectual property and technology related to high-fidelity Cas9 nucleases and Cas9 protospacer adjacent motif (PAM) variants, in a deal of undisclosed value.

And on July 28, Editas partnered with the San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR-TIGET) to research and develop genome-edited hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and T-cell therapies, in another partnership of undisclosed value.

Development of effective treatments has been hampered by the lack of good experimental models.

Now, in a new study (""Temporal Resolution of Misfolded Prion Protein Transport, Accumulation, Glial Activation, and Neuronal Death in the Retinas of Mice Inoculated with Scrapie""), published in The American Journal of Pathology, researchers describe the distinct stages of prion disease in the mouse retina and define an experimental model to test therapeutic approaches specifically.

""This work was done in collaboration with the USDA Agricultural Research Service and is an excellent example of how animal disease research can be leveraged to benefit human health,"" commented Heather West Greenlee, Ph.D., an Associate Professor in the Department of Biomedical Sciences at the Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine. ""It provides important insights into the timeline for key pathologic milestones of prion disease in the retina and a model to study mechanisms of disease progression and evaluate therapeutic interventions.""

The study used an experimental mouse model of the prion disease scrapie to determine the temporal relationship between the transport of misfolded prion protein (PrPSc) from the brain to the retina, the accumulation of PrPSc in the retina, the inflammatory response of the surrounding retinal tissue, and the loss of neurons.

It is believed that transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) progression depends on the spread of misfolded protein from one central nervous system structure to another. The investigators injected mouse-adapted scrapie into the brains of mice and studied the movement of misfolded prion protein from the brain into the retina via the optic nerve for up to 153 days postinoculation (dpi), when clinical disease becomes apparent.

By studying prion disease in the retina, which is relatively isolated from the brain, researchers were able to determine the time lag between stages of the disease process and to detect seeding of misfolded protein sequentially in the retina at 60 dpi, followed by accumulation of PrPSc and activation of retinal glia at 90 days, activation of microglia at 105 dpi, and retinal neuronal death at 120 dpi.

Prion diseases, also known as TSEs, are a transmissible protein misfolding disease, which makes them a good model to study common aspects of these diseases. ""Not only will this work contribute to the development of therapy to treat prion disease, but it may also provide important insights into which therapies may be effectively applied to the treatment of other protein misfolding diseases, including Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease,"" explained Dr. Greenlee.

Using this information, it is now possible to evaluate a potential therapy for its ability to interfere with accumulation of protein misfolding, to suppress damaging neuroinflammation, or to prevent death of neurons, she added.

Prion diseases include Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and kuru in humans, scrapie in sheep, mad cow disease in cows, and chronic wasting disease in deer.","Pharmaceuticals"

Yet some signaling processes defy this cycle. They become activated and stay activated, preventing downstream cellular functions from returning to the status quo.

Such message control may well have its uses in sustaining health or yielding to illness, which is why it attracted the interest of scientists based at Duke University. Specifically, these scientists decided to study G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that seemed to counter foundational assumptions about cell signaling.

Classically, it was known that GPCRs located along the plasma membrane inside the cell activate G proteins, which are the molecular switches that transmit signals from external sources into the cell's interior, telling the cell how to function.

The activation process is followed by desensitization, led by a protein called  -arrestin that binds to the receptor, blocking further activation of G proteins and pulling the receptor to the inside of the cell in a process termed internalization or endocytosis. The end result of these two processes is to silence receptor signaling, allowing cellular function to return to baseline.

In recent years, however, scientists learned that some GPCRs continue to signal to G proteins, even after  -arrestin has been deployed and the receptors were internalized in the cellular compartments, called endosomes. These observations challenged the existing understanding of how GPCR signaling works.

In hopes of resolving this quirk of cell signaling, the Duke scientists employed a variety of biochemical, biophysical, and cell-based methods in a new study of GPCRs. Ultimately, these scientists, led by Robert Lefkowitz, M.D., a professor at Duke and a Howard Hughes Medical Institute investigator, uncovered the existence, functionality, and architecture of previously unknown superstructures of receptors, which they've called supercomplexes or ""megaplexes.""

Details of this work appeared August 4 in the journal Cell, in an article entitled,  GPCR-G Protein- -Arrestin Super-Complex Mediates Sustained G Protein Signaling. 

 These super-complexes or 'megaplexes' more readily form at receptors that interact strongly with  -arrestins via a C-terminal tail containing clusters of serine/threonine phosphorylation sites,  wrote the article s authors.  Single-particle electron microscopy analysis of negative-stained purified megaplexes reveals that a single receptor simultaneously binds through its core region with G protein and through its phosphorylated C-terminal tail with  -arrestin. 

The megaplexes differ from the typical couplings of the receptors and  -arrestin, binding simultaneously through their core region with G protein and through a tail region with  -arrestin. Because  -arrestin interacts only with the receptor tail, the entire inner surface of the receptor is exposed, enabling the receptor to keep activating the G protein.

""The formation of such megaplexes explains how G proteins can continue to send signals after being internalized by GPCRs,"" said Dr. Lefkowitz. ""This opens a whole world of possibilities yet to be explored to manipulate this duality of signaling from outside and inside the cell for therapeutic benefit.""

Co-lead author Alex R.B. Thomsen added that some previous studies showed that the cells respond differently when G protein signaling occurs from different cellular compartments.

""As a result, pharmaceutical drugs developed in the future, if they are capable of regulating signaling at specific compartments, might be able to better treat certain diseases while having fewer side effects,"" Dr. Thomsen noted. Such research is in its infancy, however, and clinical applications are years away.","Pharmaceuticals"

According to a Technavio report in June, it is expected to expand at a CAGR of more than 8% from now to 2020. Food and drinks have the vast majority of the market share, with 83%.

Glanbia has been positioning itself in the segment through acquisitions and development. Last November, the company acquired protein-enriched bars and snacks company thinkThin. At the time of the purchase, the Los Angeles-based bar company had net sales of $84 million and a previous three-year CAGR of 31%. Primarily distributed in the United States, the acquisition helped increase Glanbia's reach.

Despite the unfavorable exchange rate that the United Kingdom's Brexit vote has caused, Glanbia Managing Director Siobhan Talbot told the Irish Independent that its look toward acquisitive growth will continue. Talbot said that while many recent opportunities have been in the sports nutrition segment, the company is also looking at growing in its dairy and ingredients businesses.

"Report: Recalls on the rise, but better testing may be the reason"," &quot;It's not that there's necessarily more contamination, it's that the industry is getting better at detecting what's there,&quot; Kevin Pollack, vice president of&nbsp;Stericycle, told Meat + Poultry. ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/report-recalls-on-the-rise-but-better-testing-may-be-the-reason/424716/","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 08:30:35 -0400","NA","Report: Recalls on the rise, but better testing may be the reasonWhole genome sequencing is quickly becoming an industry standard for improving the safety of the food supply and identifying and removing contaminated products more quickly. The increase in recalls may not mean the food supply is less safe, but rather is on its way to becoming safer.

By identifying contamination more readily, manufacturers can determine and then fix ongoing issues with their products and operations to prevent recalls from recurring in the future. When the FSMA compliance date for larger manufacturers hits next month, manufacturers who are not up to the new standards could also cause a spike in recalls, even though their products and facilities may be just as safe if not safer than before.

Another reason recall numbers appear to be higher is what Stericycle calls the multiplier effect. This is when several recalls stem from one ingredient supplier that affects dozens or even hundreds of other products and companies. In Q2, the multiplier effect drove the CRF Frozen Foods recall, which impacted 350 products from 42 brands. Last month, the CDC ended its investigation but did not identify the cause of the listeria contamination.

More recently, the same ""multiplier"" phenomenon is occurring with General Mills' ongoing flour recall, which continues to impact more brands and companies that use the flour as an ingredient in their products, particularly baking mixes. ConAgra also recently recalled nearly 200,000 pounds of P.F. Chang's frozen entrees due to potentially contaminated sugar the company used in the sauce. However, ConAgra's sugar supplier remains a mystery due to FDA corporate confidentiality laws, so this recall may not be over yet either.

Global recalls are also on the rise, but these figures illustrate the complexities manufacturers face when dealing with discrepancies in labeling errors and ingredient regulations. Those regulations can vary depending on the country or region. For example, the FDA considers propylene glycol to be ""generally recognized as safe"" in the U.S., but manufacturers have had to remove products containing this ingredient in certain European countries that have banned the ingredient.

Over the past decade, the company has increased revenue from $5.4 billion to $9.3 billion, more than doubled earnings, nearly quadrupled dividends, produced about a 400% return on its stock price and increased its Fortune 500 ranking by almost 100 spots, to No. 304 this year.

Three of Hormel's five segments posted growth in volume, sales and earnings in the quarter, which stands out from several competitors' recent earnings reports.

Jennie-O Turkey Store posted the largest segment numbers as the brand continues to bounce back from the dive it took during and following last year's bird flu outbreak. The segment reported a 59% increase in operating profit, 29% increase in volume and 20% increase in dollar sales. As the holidays draw nearer, the combination of holiday-related turkey sales and the bird flu rebound could keep these numbers strong in coming quarters.

The next largest growth numbers came from the refrigerated foods segment, which includes Hormel's 2015 acquisition of Applegate Farms. This segment boosted its operating profit by 24%, volume by 3% and dollar sales by 9%. Applegate has proven to be a strong growth channel for Hormel, especially as the brand continues to lead industrywide initiatives like removing GMOs throughout its entire supply chain.

The grocery products segment reported flat operating profit, but volume was up 1% and dollar sales up 3%. Growth here came from both legacy brands, like Spam and Skippy, but also new additions like Justin's, the nut butter-based snack maker Hormel acquired earlier this year.

Specialty foods was a notable exception to the otherwise growth-centric earnings report. The segment's operating profit was down 13% as volume dropped 32% and dollar sales fell 25%. However, those declines primarily reflected the impact of Hormel's divestment of the Diamond Crystal Brands business, the company said in a statement.

"Does red meat cause cancer?

","http://www.fooddive.com/news/does-red-meat-cause-cancer-maybe-not/424705/","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 07:16:44 -0400","NA","Does red meat cause cancer? Maybe not.The WHO's link of red and processed meats to cancer sent a shockwave through the industry late last year. In an official statement, the North American Meat Institute (NAMI) called the claim a ""dramatic and alarmist overreach"" that ""defies both common sense and numerous studies showing no correlation between meat and cancer and many more studies showing the many health benefits of balanced diets that include meat.""

Similar sentiments have echoed announcements from the WHO, FDA and U.S. Department of Health and Human Services that consumers should reduce their sugar intake for health reasons, or that manufacturers must now label added sugar in their products. The American Beverage Association and Sugar Association fought against these changes in the same way NAMI disputed WHO's meat claim.

But it's unclear who has all the answers or if any one entity is entirely right or wrong. When health claims and research could hinder sales, consumers aren't as likely to trust companies or their trade associations. Consumers may perceive them to have a financial interest and bias that could supersede public health concerns. This continues to be a major issue for industry-funded research.

This demonstrates the importance of transparency throughout the research process and reporting of the results. Transparency can illuminate or eradicate real or perceived biases to help consumers make informed food purchase decisions.

"Basic fried tortilla chips drive growth in sales"," Playing up the snack's&nbsp;indulgent side and complementing with exotic flavors&mdash;rather than trying to force alignment with consumer health preferences&mdash;could also help boost&nbsp;sales.&nbsp; ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/basic-fried-tortilla-chips-drive-growth-in-sales/424701/","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 06:23:42 -0400","NA","Basic fried tortilla chips drive growth in salesBalancing the demand for better-for-you products with maintaining or enhancing a product's flavor and texture continues to be a challenge for all manufacturers, not just those who work with tortilla chips. Only about 40% of consumers said they'd be willing to sacrifice flavor for a better-for-you option, according to Nielsen.

Tortilla chips are ultimately still considered an indulgence for many consumers. Making a healthier version can extend a product's reach to health-conscious consumers. But if the flavor isn't on par with previous varieties or other brands on the shelf, manufacturers could waste their reformulation efforts on a product that doesn't sell.

Instead of focusing on the processing method, manufacturers may be able to offset health concerns about frying by using ingredients that resonate with consumers' perception of what is healthy. That might include non-GMO or organic corn, oils and seasonings, or ancient grains and beans that deliver additional health benefits. Here too, manufacturers also have to remain focused on any flavor impact these ingredients might have on the final product.

Playing up the indulgent side of tortilla chips and complementing with exotic flavors could be another option for boosting sales. Manufacturers can consider brand and product partnerships with dips, a common counterpart to tortilla chips. That could mean creating a simpler flavor profile for the chip itself that consumers can enjoy in a new way when paired with the right dip.

Frito-Lay has taken both flavor-driven and health-driven approaches with its tortilla chip brands. With Doritos, Frito-Lay focused on flavor and even shapes with products like Doritos Collisions and Doritos Jacked 3D, a three-dimensional version of the legacy chip brand. The Tostitos brand has pursued healthier versions aside from baked varieties, including organic Tostitos under the Simply line, which boosted revenue for the Frito-Lay segment in the most recently reported quarter.","F&B"

The price gap between food bought at grocery stores versus out at restaurants keeps growing, and is now at 440 basis points. That's the widest the gap has been in almost seven years, Deutsche Bank analyst Shane Higgins told Nation's Restaurant News.

Lower prices could drive more traffic to grocery stores, but many consumers will still demand the convenience and RTE nature of foods available at restaurants. Manufacturers are making more prepared food products and making their products more portable and snack-friendly through packaging and formulation changes.

This could be an opportunity for frozen food manufacturers to stage a comeback. General Mills' The Good Table brand recently debuted a line of Freezer to Plate meals that offers better-for-you, gourmet-style meals with less than five minutes of prep time from frozen chicken to the dinner table.

Frozen foods can offer complete meals with several components, like restaurants, without hours of prep time for consumers. Brands like Lean Cuisine and Luvo have worked to overcome assumptions tha processed food is less healthy to better align the category with consumer nutrition demands.","F&B"

About 5% of the total food supply is now organic.

Consumer demand for these products, which are grown or raised without artificial chemicals, drives the growth of the sector. And the focus on increasing organic grain could give wheat the jolt the industry desires following the recent slump in whole wheat sales.

According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the demand for organic products has surpassed the domestic supply. Manufacturers wanting to take advantage of the organic trend are looking for more sources, and may even find themselves going overseas.

With organic wheat contracted in Colorado, Idaho, Kansas, Michigan, Nebraska, Texas, Wyoming and Saskatchewan, in the last nine months Ardent Mills has been able to add organic durum, cracked wheat and spelt to its product line. The company has provided educational workshops, support services and long-term contracts to help farmers change their methods.","F&B"
"Simple and indulgent dairy ingredients developed"," As consumers&nbsp;crave more premium&nbsp;dairy&nbsp;products and&nbsp;food items that fit into the better-for-you and&nbsp;clean label&nbsp;trends, Arla's latest product&nbsp;launch makes sense.

Torben Jenson, a category and application manager for Arla Foods, said it himself as he announced the line of ingredients: ""Our new concepts are healthy, convenient and clean-label, which means they are completely on-trend.""

Arla started 2016 by projecting an ""unpredictable and tough"" year. In 2015, the dairy-based company's global revenues fell 3.3%. The dairy industry worldwide has had a difficult time, with farmers getting an estimated 20% less for their milk this year than in 2015, and 40% less than in 2014. According to Rabobank, the total value of dairy sales worldwide has dropped, with the top 20 producers earning 13% less in 2015 than the previous year.

These new ingredients are a potentially lucrative way for Arla   which Rabobank ranks as the world's 7th largest dairy producer   to innovate.

"New app transforms nutrition facts into eye candy"," The Sage Project&nbsp;stands alongside SmartLabel as another way manufacturers can communicate food information to consumers beyond their product label and website. ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/new-app-transforms-nutrition-facts-into-eye-candy/424633/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 09:14:34 -0400","NA","New app transforms nutrition facts into eye candySage Project stands alongside SmartLabel as another way manufacturers can communicate food information to consumers beyond their product label and website. Product labels provide limited real estate for manufacturers to communicate certain information about ingredients, sourcing, processing and other aspects of creating a product and bringing it to market. Web-based platforms like Sage Project and SmartLabel offer more easily scalable ways for manufacturers to share all the information consumers demand today.

Sage Project takes the concept of transparency and sharing food information one step further by making this information more easily digestible and understandable through interactive visuals. Visual media have changed the ways consumers seek and share information, including food and products they buy. Consumers may start to expect information shared in more visually appealing ways as manufacturers become more transparent about their products and business practices to build trust with consumers.

Manufacturers should establish a balance with the understanding that they could potentially overwhelm consumers with too much information. A recent report from the Center for Food Integrity also found that consumers tend to look for different information in different places, such as on product labels versus company or third-party websites, which could factor into companies' transparency strategies.

Sage Project, SmartLabel and QR codes are a few of many ways manufacturers can communicate food-related information to consumers. But ultimately, manufacturers should ""go out of your way to listen to your customers and then respond based on what their needs actually are, not what you think they are,"" Sam Slover, cofounder and CEO of the Sage Project, recently told Food Dive.

"While sales lose their fizz, soda brands still lead the market"," Carbonated beverages made up half of the top 10 leading global soft drink brands this year, despite almost universal sales declines. ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/while-sales-lose-their-fizz-soda-brands-still-lead-the-market/424619/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 08:31:41 -0400","NA","While sales lose their fizz, soda brands still lead the marketOf the top 10 soft drink brands, soda brands held five spots. All of those brands saw their sales decline except Mountain Dew (No. 9), which may be benefiting from a series of marketing campaigns and throwback brand reintroductions. Despite declines in brand value, soda brands remain some of the most widely consumed beverages in the U.S., which means any turnaround for the category could be a game-changer as beverage companies continue to diversify.

RTD tea, bottled water, sports drinks and energy drinks comprised most of the rest of the soft drinks list, and they were among the fastest-growing categories outlined in an IRI report earlier this year. Beverages continue to offer manufacturers significant potential for growth if they can align with the right trends at key moments.

Folgers, Lipton and Nescafe were among the soft drink brands with the highest brand value growth at 33%, 19% and 18%, respectively. Folgers growth could be rebounding from a slow 2015, when the brand was dealing with lagging sales. Smucker had raised prices due to high coffee costs, and competition in the segment increased.

Tropicana, Red Bull and Pepsi posted the largest brand value declines at 15%, 12% and 11%, respectively. Sales dips in the juice category overall impacted Tropicana, one of the best-known brands in the category. Energy drinks continue to grapple with health concerns from consumers and public health advocates, related lawsuits and increased competition from startups entering the segment with natural alternatives and exotic flavors and ingredients.","F&B"

The acquisition of the global licence will enable Mondelez to manufacture and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits worldwide.

""The acquisition of the global licence will enable Mondelez to manufacture and sell Cadbury-branded biscuits worldwide.""

According to a co-manufacturing deal, Burton s will manufacture Cadbury-branded biscuits at its facilities.

This move comes after Hershey rejected a $23m acquisition offer from Mondelez.

Mondelez owns brands such as Oreo, LU and Nabisco.

Burton s was quoted by The Guardian as stating that this deal will enable it to 'implement a transformational growth plan across its core brands, including Maryland, Jammie Dodgers, Wagon Wheels and Fish n Chips, and continue to invest in innovation to grow'.

Two years ago, the two firms held negotiations as Burton s was planning to divest its Cadbury biscuits unit in order to acquire McVities' brandowner UB; however, the talks failed and UB was acquired by Turkish firm Yildiz for  2bn.

A few months ago, talks resumed between Mondelez and Burton s, in which Ontario Teacher s Pension Fund owns a majority stake.","F&B"

Whether multi lane conveyors, accumulation conveyors, air conveyors or belt conveyors, internal transport systems have to meet the industry pressures for greater speed, reduced energy consumption, improved flexibility and more, as Claire Rowan discovers.

Intralox is innovating to address the challenges of back pressure for lighterweight containers, smooth transfers, and reduced product footprint plus greater efficiencies, as Intralox container team and packaging team business development analyst Yan Liang reveals.

What are the main challenges to achieving consistent smooth transport of soft drinks packs in plant?



For mass product handling, in particular, managing back pressure is an issue.  As a result of the continuous  light weighting  of primary containers, today s PET bottles and cans are much more fragile and prone to damage and tipping than ever before. As a result, much greater care has to be taken in the engineering and design of both the conveyor system and materials.

For product transfer, maintaining smooth and continuous transfers is paramount to managing both minimal backpressure as well as product tipping. As with all modern conveying, line controls are very important for monitoring line conditions in real time, to allow adjustments to be made to the system and ensure continuous throughput.

For full cases   ie once the containers are in a case   the same basic issues as mentioned above are important. However, methods for managing them are different. Managing backpressure, case orientation changes in continuous motion, as well as case quality are some of the major concerns. Again, transfers are a major consideration especially due to the trend in the beverage industry for creating smaller secondary packaging sizes such as four, six or eight packs. Intralox has spent a great deal of time in

developing new technologies for small pack transfers that gently and smoothly transfer packs from one conveyor to another without tripping or disrupting case orientation.

How has Intralox innovated to improve the performance of internal conveying systems?

The ARB Switch S7050 and ARB Turner-Divider S7050 are the latest additions to Intralox s Activated Roller Belt (ARB) collection. Both offer turning and laning of products at high speeds, accommodation of pack changes, and minimised downtime and maintenance.

This equipment addresses new market demands for flexibility in production lines, low packaging material costs, and optimal product handling. Benefits include:

  Efficient switching of products at up to 500 packages per minute

  The ability to turn, switch, and transfer multiple sizes of retail-ready products on the same equipment.

The ARB Turner Divider S7050 is able to turn and square packs through zero or ninety degrees; divide packages into one, two or three lanes; plus reject and bypass, all on one piece of equipment in a shorter footprint than traditional technology   all this at speeds of up to 300 cases per minute.

C-Trak, a bespoke conveyor manufacturer for the food and beverage industry, has recently created a multiple lane conveyor accumulator designed with side guides.

The brief included the need to handle various sized glass bottles filled with mineral water, which were manually loaded on to a plastic slat conveyor.  The bottles needed to be held in place by numerous positioned stainless steel opening and closing barriers that could be released on demand.

C-Trak s solution transferred the bottles along the lanes to a secondary conveyor fitted with removable plastic loading trays, where they are accumulated until required before being switched to an adjoining multi-lane conveyor.

This application was designed with flexibility in mind. It can be adapted to handle various sized bottles plus the packing boxes, which can be conveyed ready for labelling.","F&B"

Demand for clean label and natural products continues apace. In fact, fuelled by developments in communication and social media, the trend is extending to see natural equate to healthy as Beverage Innovation discovers.

In order to examine the clean label trend, colouring foodstuffs expert GNT conducted a comprehensive survey among 5,000 consumers in Europe, Asia and America. It discovered that people have an increasingly critical attitude towards additives as GNT head of group marketing Guido de Jager explains.

What is driving the trend towards clean label?

In spite of the fact that the term is not defined consistently, consumers consider clean labels to guarantee that food and beverages are free from artificial additives. They should offer short, understandable ingredient lists, which provide precise information about origin and use of the ingredients. Natural, familiar ingredients ensure a good feeling and have a positive influence on purchase decisions. They look for alternatives to colourants and E-numbers when shopping for groceries. More than two thirds thoroughly check ingredient lists, to make sure that products fulfil their expectations. 67% want easy to understand ingredient information.

The need for clear label solutions is also driven by regulations. Just recently the Gulf Cooperation Council, for example, published a legislation on the colours Allura Red AC, Sunset Yellow, Azorubine and Tartrazine in order to dovetail better with international standards. All these underline the importance for manufacturers of taking clean label solutions into account.

How does this trend differ from country to country?

In Asia and South America, 60% of consumers are aware of healthy nutrition, but do not have time to investigate ingredients thoroughly. For more than half of the consumers in Europe and the US it s particularly important that food can be prepared quickly and conveniently. For both groups, easy to understand and transparent ingredient information is key.

How has consumer understanding of natural/clean label changed over recent years?

When people see the term  clean label , they expect natural food and beverages without any artificial additives. Our study reveals that 64% will put  natural  on the same level as  healthy . Consequently, products with natural ingredients are considered to be healthier than those with artificial additives. This trend has been increasing in recent years. Today s consumers are well informed. When it comes to food colours, they have a clear definition of  naturalness  in mind: nearly 50% expect natural food colourings to originate solely from edible raw materials such as fruit and vegetables.

Colouring Foods fully meet consumer demands and are ideally suited for the production of clean label beverages. They are exclusively made from fruit, vegetables and edible plants. On the packaging, they can therefore be declared as,  Colouring Food (concentrate of pumpkin, carrots) , for example. No solvents or chemicals are used. They are pure food   the epitome of clean label. Manufacturers can benefit from a clear communication of the use of truly natural colours: Credible claims like  coloured with fruit and vegetables  give producers the potential to increase brand preference even when a price increase is applied.","F&B"

" How to stay ahead of ever-changing consumer behaviour ","Mash Direct's Martin Hamilton explains how businesses, especially in food and farming, can stay ahead of consumer behaviour.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/how-to-stay-ahead-of-ever-changing-consumer-behaviour/","Tue, 16 Aug 2016 14:55:58 +0000","Agriculture"," How to stay ahead of ever-changing consumer behaviour No matter the industry your business is in, taking note of consumer behaviour and pre-empting demand is invaluable in ensuring your business remains current and successful. As the priorities and palates of consumers evolve, businesses must ensure they keep ahead of the curve and develop alongside these trends, meeting ever-growing demand.

Consumer needs vary depending on region, age group, demographic and spending habits; however, you must also bear in mind the differences from country to country. As an international brand, we know all too well the fluctuations of ever-changing consumer behaviour and how, as a business, you need to keep on top of these in order to achieve success, both at home and further afield.

The UK food and drink industry is developing at a phenomenal rate   a rate that is continually driven by consumer trends and behaviour. Businesses need to capitalise upon this growth. At Mash Direct, we ve noticed a growing tendency of people wanting spicier flavours, something that we believe has, in part, developed through increased international travel. In response to this demand, we evolved the recipe for our Baby Bakes, our baby potatoes sprinkled with a crunchy crumb, enhancing them with spice as a result of consumers wanting hotter flavours. It has proved popular in both our home market as well as Dubai, and shows how jumping on the back of changing consumer tastes has been extremely fruitful for us, and can be for your business too.

It s definitely worth considering and we hope the following will help you to better understand your target market.

Research shows that consumer purchases can be divided into two categories: traditional, including convenience and taste attributes; and evolving, which include health and social responsibility characteristics. The importance of the heritage and provenance of products is rising and as a result, businesses are adapting their marketing strategy to tap into these opportunities. As people become more concerned with the produce they are buying, it leaves businesses in an even more competitive position.

For us, keeping up to date with the latest tastes and trends is key. Social media plays a growing part in this as it s a great way to see what people are engaging with, what the latest trends are and who s driving this change. This contributes and influences the direction our business takes and the products we create.

While food and drink trends are a common topic of everyday conversation, other sectors must also take a prominent interest in the direction their sector is taking. Trade exhibitions and consumer research are good places to begin, whether at home or abroad. After all, in order for a business to succeed, your main priority is appealing to your target market, therefore you need to get to know them personally.

The need to know your audience, and evolve with them, will ensure your business remains at the forefront. Enhancing growth through stronger customer engagement will all help you move in the right direction to maintain success, while solidifying customer confidence.","F&B"
"Using intelligent, mobile technology to streamline packaging specification management"," 
	The packaging specification market is expected to grow to around $1 trillion by 2020, according to the research firm, Smithers Pira, making up around 200-plus million packaging SKUs around the world.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89051-using-intelligent-mobile-technology-to-streamline-packaging-specification-management","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Using intelligent, mobile technology to streamline packaging specification managementThe packaging specification market is expected to grow to around $1 trillion by 2020, according to the research firm, Smithers Pira (smitherspira.com), making up around 200-plus million packaging SKUs around the world. With 60 million in the U.S. alone this number is growing daily, as is the complicated process of sharing specs and managing them, both internally and externally. This growing complexity impacts the entire value chain.

Today, there is no common method, technology solution or platform for handling packaging specifications and they typically end up being managed through disparate systems and solutions, such as emails, spreadsheets, binders and ERP systems. ERP & PLM systems are not built for SKU and specification management and specification repositories, generally PDF-based, are not comprehensive enough or allow intelligent data analysis.

Because of the lack of standard systems, it is a sad reality that companies typically manage the symptoms of problems and accepts them as the normal course of business and acceptable  institutional  costs. They add people, layer on processes, create task forces, restructure and insert software not designed for a specific purpose hoping that it can be modified to address the business needs and produce results.

The challenge with traditional technology and organizational solutions is that they mask the real problems. Tremendous time is spent, costs go up and the problems don t go away   as soon as any variable changes, the problems reappear. Companies spend many millions of dollars to cover these additional institutional costs and still rarely solve the problem; it hasn t been easy.

Simply, finding and addressing the real root cause of problems has been difficult; there are so many things out of your control and the complexities in the supply chain are increasing even further. Whether it is problems with suppliers and raw materials that create huge production costs, production downtime due to bad or missing parts/products, logistics problems on all ends, groups that cannot communicate or even the fear of changing suppliers since it creates an entirely new set of potential pitfalls   companies find it too difficult to get to the root cause.

All it takes is one bad spec to lead to a failure, which can lead to product recalls and potential devastating damage to the brand. Packaging specifications can ultimately impact product lead-time, as well as all activities across the internal and external value chain (marketing, sales, purchasing, logistics) and ultimately, impact the delivery to the customer.

Many companies today are still managing their packaging specifications in traditional software systems that are not specifically designed to manage specs, and the result is a proliferation of SKU s, higher costs, greater business risk and inefficiencies throughout the value chain   which ultimately is driving costs higher and higher for every stakeholder. And, the answer is not to simply continue to demand price reductions from suppliers. Solving the root cause and ultimately decreasing costs across the entire value chain requires a new way of approaching specifications to ensure their accuracy.

Compounding the complexities already found within the value chain is consumers  ever-increasing need for transparency and demanding to know, not only what is in their products, but also where they came from and who made them. Today s disparate systems make it difficult or nearly impossible to implement traceability across a value chain. A simple review of the enormous number of FDA recalls due to not identifying allergens shows how difficult it is to maintain accurate specs from multiple suppliers and convey those specs accurately and timely on a product packaging label so consumers are aware of ingredients in their food.

Accurate specs enable the value chain to function faster and effectively, while inaccurate specifications impact logistics, transportation, speed to market, responsiveness to recall/failure and the very foundations or business, etc.

Solving the complexities of packaging specifications across value chains can produce enormous savings for all stakeholders. Achieving those savings requires cooperation among stakeholders and an easy-to-use, simple solution that enables the sharing of specification DNA, both internally and externally, across the entire value chain. With today s mobile and cloud-based technology, the field of specification management is poised to take advantage of these latest advances in technology. Intelligent, cloud-based solutions that allow anywhere/any device access greatly enhance companies  ability to deploy their specs anywhere, anytime to employees and suppliers around the world.

Furthermore, the DNA of billions of specifications creates an enormous amount of big data. With 200 million specifications, each with 30 attributes equates to six billion data points that can be analyzed. Big data analysis provides the ability to identify cost-saving trends and opportunities that are otherwise hidden in a myriad of unconnected, disparate systems. Opportunities, such as raw material indexing, new product development, green idea development, analyzing currency impacts on raw material, transportation optimization, capacity expansion and more.

Today, specifications are impacting all value chains and the impact is more negative than positive. With systems designed and built specifically for spec management, specifications will have a positive effect for every stakeholder across the value chain, no matter what the product.

specright is a specification management company with a vision to leverage specification expertise and cloud technology to improve the way specifications are shared, analyzed and audited. The company's mission is to empower customer efficiencies by providing Intelligent Specification Management Platforms that are available anytime, anywhere from any device.

","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89048-retail-ready-packaging-offers-advantages-over-traditional-packaging","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Retail ready packaging offers advantages over traditional packagingDemand for retail ready packaging is forecast to increase 5.2% annually to $6.2 billion in 2020, outpacing the overall packaging market average. Retail ready packaging (RRP), also known as shelf ready packaging, display ready packaging, and pallet ready packaging, refers to secondary packaging for retail products that arrives in a manner enabling items to go directly onto the shelf or selling floor without the need for unpacking of inner contents.

RRP offers a number of advantages over traditional retail packaging in terms of labor costs, stock handling, and product visibility. Gains will be supported by further growth of mass retailers and club stores, and increased food and beverage sales volume in nontraditional outlets such as drug and dollar stores. Additionally, the proliferation of club stores and no-frills deep discount grocery stores will be especially important for RRP, as such stores primarily sell merchandise directly from secondary packaging and require their vendors to ship products in RRP, according to The Freedonia Group's (freedoniagroup.com) new study, Retail Ready Packaging.

Among major RRP product types, corrugated boxes, which represent more than 50 percent of total demand, will provide the strongest opportunities. According to analyst Esther Palevsky, ""Growth will be supported by expansion in the retail user base and the increased presence of value-added box types."" Gains for retail ready corrugated floor displays, folding cartons and reusable plastic containers (RPCs) will be more moderate than those for boxes, but will still be helped by overall retail trends promoting greater use of RRP.

Food is the predominant market for RRP, accounting for almost three-fourths of demand in 2015. Through 2020, growth in food uses will be fueled by labor cost savings resulting from reduction of product handling requirements during stocking. In addition, disruptive trends in the U.S. food retailing landscape will bode well for RRP. Among such trends is the increasing competition that traditional supermarkets face from a host of alternatives, including club stores, deep discounters, mass retailers, drug stores, farmers' markets, and e-commerce vendors. Increased openings of smaller-format locations by mass retailers will also promote gains for RRP, as these stores carry a more limited product selection than their traditional counterparts and have fewer employees. These stores can benefit from RRP's ability to speed stocking of shelves and increase shelf space efficiency.","Packaging"

 According to Excelsior Wines, U.S. importer for Frontera and parent company Concha y Toro, Chile s best-selling wine brand hopes to appeal to a new generation of wine lovers   21-34 year olds   with Frontera After Dark.

Starting this fall, consumers will notice striking changes to Frontera s 750-ml. range, including the addition of an  After Dark  tagline, a nod to the younger generation, for whom  The day starts to come alive at night!  Frontera Night Harvest Blends are a fresh winemaking concept: grapes harvested in the cool of the night for bolder flavors and aromas.

 

 Labels for Frontera After Dark 750-ml. bottles   the favored format of millennial wine lovers -- will now sport a dramatic black background, overlaid by a depiction of the Andes Mountains, traced in pale gold, making Frontera one of the first  dark-label  entries in the $4-7 value-wine sector. Dark labels represent a powerful new trend in the U.S. marketplace and dominate the landscape where millennials are concerned, as registered by an impressive +29% volume increase over traditional cream/white labels in 2015.

 

 Joining Frontera s After Dark 750-ml. line-up are two new blends: Moonlight White and After Midnight Red. Moonlight White is a semi-sweet style, faintly effervescent, fresh, light Moscato-based blend. After Midnight Red is a Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend, rounded out with a touch of Merlot.

 

 Frontera After Dark 750-ml. white varietals, including the new Moonlight White as well as the Pinot Noir will be sealed with a twist-off closure. Frontera  After Dark  750-ml. reds, including After Midnight Red, will remain under cork. Each Frontera After Dark label will retail for approx. $6.

 

 Support for Frontera After Dark will be provided via a 360 marketing campaign. At the  pre-tail  level, this includes geo-targeted social media ads and partnerships with the Ibotta in-store shopping app and online delivery services such as Drizly. Retail promotions include in-store radio ads, floor talkers and high-value discount bottle neckers, logoed wine racks, case cards, case sleeves and cold-box trays. A digital ad campaign, targeted at social media influencers and featuring wine cocktails and sangria recipes is also underway.

Frontera s classic 1.5-liter varietal range is also poised for a makeover, albeit of a more subtle nature. Launched in the U.S. in the early 1980s, Frontera s 1.5-liter format was an instant hit with baby boomers and today enjoys a multi-generational appeal. Starting in this summer, labels for Frontera s 1.5-liter wines will feature an enhanced image of the Andes Mountains juxtaposed against a cream background, to evoke a heightened sense of place and origin. A  ticket-stub  addition, with the varietal name positioned above a  Vineyards Protected by Nature  tagline, conveys a sense of journey, while referencing Chile s pristine natural environment, which offers exceptional conditions in which to nurture fine quality wines.","Packaging"

Along with that, a brand s commitment to sustainability and wellness is an increasingly competitive tool to drive consumer preference. As brands seek to tap into sustainability and wellness trends, brand owners can make significant strides in the arena with clean labels, transparency   both figuratively and literally   and by striving to reduce their carbon footprint throughout the supply chain.

In today s competitive market, communication is essential in order to establish consumer trust. To strengthen brand loyalty and attract consumers at point of sale, brand owners must speak to consumers through easy-to-read labels. Additionally, benefits such as sugar free, organic and non-GMO should be made very clear considering the increasing demand for wholesome products. As shoppers become more interested in knowing how products are manufactured, brands that effectively communicate sustainable business practices and how their ingredients are sourced help cultivate consumer trust.

The demand for nutritious products puts pressure on both brand owners and retailers   which makes communicating benefits more important than ever. For example, the national pharmacy CVS, rebranded to CVS Health in 2014, has seen increasing demand for more health-conscious food and beverage products. After a pilot program in 2015 in which the company offered healthier options in 500 stores throughout the nation, the chain is now expanding the initiative to 2,900 CVS pharmacy locations. The team at CVS also expects to occupy 25% of checkout space   traditionally reserved for products like candy and chocolate bars   with wellness products.

The trend for healthier products presents an excellent opportunity for food and beverage brands. When packaging reflects key benefits consumers are seeking, they can immediately connect with the brand and have a greater chance of choosing that product over an alternative.

A demonstrated concern for the environment is another aspect setting good and great brands apart. This applies to virtually every sector, including the beverage industry. Companies that position their brands as market leaders   and are planning to remain there for the long run   must be proactive in their sustainability efforts.

As part of the Bacardi Limited  Good Spirited: Building a Sustainable Future  environmental initiative, for example, the company promoted its 100% biomass-fueled distillery for its Tequila CAZADORES  in Mexico. Nothing goes to waste in the production process; organic materials, including fibers from the agave used to make the tequila, are converted to biofuel in order to power the distillery. As a result, the distillery reduced noise pollution by 20% and greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions by more than 80%.

In order to ensure consumer loyalty and longevity for a brand, a team must take the necessary steps to innovate and address challenges that come along with evolving trends. At PACK EXPO International, beverage brand owners will find the latest innovations that address wellness and sustainability. Attendees can expect to see materials that preserve freshness and reduce waste as well as labeling systems that provide greater sustainability and flexibility. The show will feature the latest advancements in robotics and automation as well as advanced technologies for dispensing, filling, cleaning and reducing water usage.

As someone intimately involved in pharmaceutical packaging in practice and teaching, serialization is part of every single day.

At the Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council (HCPC), we try to imagine how DSCSA might support safer packaging for consumers. The opportunities are numerous but for the moment everyone is focused on getting the job done. HCPC does note however, that this effort is mute the second we enter pharmacy and begin the antiquated process of repackaging prescriptions into little amber vials which truly unravels the potentially safe supply chain being sought by DSCSA. As well, the process contributes to poor health outcomes, through lack of reminder packaging, and unsafe products, due to exposure to moisture and oxygen post-pharmacy. (The HCPC study on post-pharmacy exposure is available at hcpconline.org.)

At Pester Pac Automation, I see case packer after case packer being readied for serialization as pharma manufacturers and contract packagers scramble to meet looming deadlines. The serialization providers and case packing methods are varied but the end result is the same. A simple process made overly complicated by a procedure which does not integrate well with automated case packing, i.e., line of sight barcode read and capture for bottles and cartons as they are collated and transferred to cases. Thanks to creative engineering, the challenge has been met but the process is less than elegant.

Before we were tasked with barcode serialization, RFID was the likely carrier for serial ID from about 2003 until around 2011. Around that time it was decided that RFID was not mature or robust enough for the task (It was also expensive). Many did not concur with that opinion but the money won the argument. I sincerely believe that those who killed RFID hoped that the complexity and cumbersome nature of line of sight barcode capture would kill any national pedigree legislation. Serialization was undesirable in any fashion; they gambled and they lost. Here we are, saddled with inserting this task into what were formerly efficient packaging processes. This task would have been dramatically less complex with RFID.

The spring of 2016 saw the inaugural graduate pharmaceutical packaging course at Rutgers University. We heard how students new to this world of pharmaceutical packaging would respond to the serialization task. Some were already engaged in the process as entry level employees at pharmaceutical manufacturers. Without exception, they wondered why  we  chose barcode over RFID or some other method that did not hinder the packaging process.

 We  went into the explanation and these grad students began to learn that it is not technology that rules the day, but politics. Even in the world of packaging, special interest groups and the power of politics trump technology. That is why we continue to repack in pharmacy; that is why we still have paper printed outserts; and that is why we are struggling to capture barcode reads instead of RFID. It was a valuable if not humbling lesson for the students, but it will make them better prepared to combat the objections they will encounter.

Better packaging solutions are out there; we need leaders who will look past the bottom line to engage them.

The Healthcare Compliance Packaging Council is a not-for-profit trade association whose mission is to promote the greater use of compliance-prompting packaging to improve patient adherence and patient outcomes, which will lead to reduced healthcare costs. The positive effects of this style of packaging have been proven by numerous studies over the past twenty years, yet U.S. pharmaceutical distribution still clings to an antiquated amber vial for a majority of prescriptions. While advances have been made in every facet of our daily lives, life-saving medication packaging remains in a vial introduced in the 1950s. The HCPC is working to change this.

"The Wine Group incorporates a state-of-the-art packaging line"," 
	When it came time to install a new packaging line, The Wine Group needed a solution that addressed reducing overall footprint, providing more accumulation and increased efficiency gains on the line. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89039-the-wine-group-incorporates-a-state-of-the-art-packaging-line","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","The Wine Group incorporates a state-of-the-art packaging lineThe Wine Group (TWG) is one of the largest wine producers in the world, distributing more than 60 million cases of wine each year. From its corporate headquarters in Livermore, CA, the company ships out over five million cases of wine annually throughout North America, Western Europe and Asia. Satisfying the palates of wine lovers worldwide involves a sophisticated process. When it came time to install a new packaging line in the Livermore facility, TWG turned to its trusted partner for 15-plus years, Hartness International (hartness.com). With a shared commitment to excellence, Hartness has supplied accumulation and end-of-line packaging equipment in the past for TWG s Ripon and Livermore facilities.

 When we were putting in the new line in Livermore, we were looking for a line that was fully automated, could handle a variety of different sized packages and essentially  do it all ,  says TWG plant manager Ryan Dean.

From screw cap, cork, poly-laminated and PVC capsules, bulk glass and RSC glass, the line needed to handle a variety of customer demands. With the automated line, it was essential for TWG to increase accumulation capacity in order to minimize the effects of occasional micro-stops and downtime. Equally important was the ability for all of the equipment pieces to work together seamlessly.

A solution was needed that addressed reducing overall footprint, providing more accumulation and increased efficiency gains on the line. In the end, TWG opted to incorporate a DYNAC accumulation machine, case packer and laner from Hartness.

There were several components to this solution, but accumulation was the key. The Wine Group already had installed Hartness  DYNAC accumulation system and a top-load case packer and high-speed laner in other areas of its facility, and the company knew that these would integrate well together on the new line. DYNAC isolates the upstream and downstream operations by absorbing the changes in the line and providing a consistent metered flow of bottles.

On the TWG s line a new DYNAC 6900 was positioned between the filler/labeler and the laner/packer, allowing these machine centers to be close to each other, yet operate independently. The resulting DYNAC-centric design provided the desired smaller footprint and ample accumulation, and gave TWG the ability to work multiple line layout options to uncover the most productive design.

 These changes led to incredible advancements in efficiency for our line,  says Dean.

Since the installation of the DYNAC 6900, TWG has seen 10% efficiency gains on its most difficult molds. These gains drive dollar-for-dollar cases down by more than five cents each and represent 50,000 cases of incremental volume annually. As for material savings, Dean estimates that they have  approximately 95% less waste thanks to the DYNAC. 

As TWG does not run a traditional operator-at-each-machine scenario, the DYNAC accumulation provides enough uptime for plant operators to float on the floor where needed.

 We can run lean and prioritize where we are going to focus on the line because of the DYNAC. It provides about seven minutes of uptime when another piece of equipment is down, which gives our operators ample time to repair any issues on the line without interruption,  says Dean.

These time savings of minutes can also add up quickly and result in days of production time not lost over the course of a year.

The above savings could not be possible without proper communication between the equipment on the line and personnel involved.

 The Hartness DYNAC needed to communicate with our labeler and they were in sync when we needed them to be   as soon as we started them,  says Dean.

TWG turned to Hartness for additional secondary packaging solutions. Upstream, the DYNAC was communicating well with the labeler and earlier on with the filler. Downstream, the bottles still needed to be packed. TWG wanted to ensure that the chosen equipment would integrate with the rest of the line, as well as handle the variety of products to be packed on the line. The solution was a Hartness laner and case packer.

Hartness  Global Laner was selected for its high-speed capabilities as well as its smooth, servo-controlled operation and gentle handling of labeled bottles. With a changeover of less than 10 minutes, the laner is flexible enough to handle broad product sizes.

TWG also chose to install the Hartness 2800, a 40-cycles-per-minute servo-controlled case packer. One unique feature of the 2800 is its air transfer system, which eliminates line pressure as it captures the bottles and positions them above the grid for packing. Bottles are vertically loaded through plastic fingers that guide the bottles into the cases.

 What s nice about the Hartness Case Packer is that it can pack directly into a case with or without partitions, which gives us the ability of running two types of glass,  says Dean.

Ensuring successful product delivery, Hartness also provided the conveyor and control from the DYNAC to the packer resulting in a vertically integrated solution. Communication didn t stop at line integration. Training was also important to ensure success post-installation.

 Hartness trained the plant operators very well and worked with them at the pace they needed. Within a couple days, our team was able to pick up on how to operate the equipment properly and it s been working well ever since,  Dean explains.  Whether I needed parts or service performed, Hartness post-install was equally impressive in their customer service and response time. 

Since 1981, The Wine Group has delighted consumers around the world with unbeatable brand value and continuous innovation to consistently exceed their expectations. Having partners like Hartness ensures those values and beliefs are upheld at every stage of production.

 Hartness has been tried and true for us. Whenever we are looking at bottle handling or case handling equipment, Hartness is always at the top of the list based on the partnership that we ve built with them during the last 15-plus years at the Wine Group   and definitely at this facility over the past eight years,  says Dean.  I would say our new line is the most state-of-the art line in California today. ","Packaging"
"U.S. demand for caps & closures to approach $12 billion"," 
	Demand for caps and closures in the US is expected to grow 4.2% per year to $11.8 billion in 2020, with gains bolstered primarily by the growing use of high-value dispensing and child-resistant closures (CRCs). &nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89036-us-demand-for-caps-closures-to-approach-12-billion","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","U.S. demand for caps & closures to approach $12 billionDemand for caps and closures in the US is expected to grow 4.2% per year to $11.8 billion in 2020, with gains bolstered primarily by the growing use of high value dispensing and child-resistant closures (CRCs). A mitigating factor for value growth will be continued lightweighting, which drives down the costs of raw material and keeps prices low. These and other trends are presented in Caps & Closures, a new study from The Freedonia Group (freedoniagroup.com), a Cleveland-based industry research firm.

Continued efforts to make foods and beverages more convenient to consume on the go, as well as to control portion sizes, will drive unit demand for caps and closures. Single serving beverage bottles are seeing greater use in fruit juices and drinks, flavored and enhanced waters, and other ready-to-drink beverages as consumers look for substitutes for carbonated soft drinks that can be easily transported and consumed while away from home.

According to analyst Katie Wieser,  Food producers are turning to rigid packaging for single serving snacks to make them less prone to crushing and easier to consume on the go. Both of these trends have bolstered gains for a variety of caps and closures, though plastic threaded caps, dispensing closures, and lids have seen the greatest impact.  These trends will continue to reach new markets and lead to the development of products with even greater levels of convenience, such as spouted pouches for a variety of drinkable foods.

Another factor that affects cap and closure demand is the continued shift from glass bottles and jars to plastic packaging formats. Innovations in hot-fill processing and barrier technologies have allowed plastic bottles and jars to gain significant share from glass alternatives. This has created good opportunities for plastic caps and closures, which will continue to hold the largest share of cap and closure demand and post healthy gains. Of all plastic closure types, dispensing and child-resistant closures will increase the fastest. Metal crowns and screw caps, on the other hand, will see only modest growth due to slow gains for beer production and the rising use of aluminum cans in the craft beer segment. However, metal roll-on caps will help to bolster gains somewhat as they see greater use for still wines and beverages packaged in aluminum bottles.","Packaging"
"The year of bio-based packaging"," 
	Bio-based packaging materials offer great opportunity for food and beverage companies. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89037-the-year-of-bio-based-packaging","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","The year of bio-based packagingDerived from renewable materials such as wood fiber from trees or plastic from sugarcane, bio-based packaging materials offer great opportunity for food and beverage companies. Granting longer product life, sustainability and other benefits, it is met with enthusiasm from both packagers and consumers.

Though sometimes challenging to make the transition to bio-based substitutes, it would be a surprise to find a food or beverage supplier who hasn t at least tested it. Recent innovations are pushing the boundaries of sustainable packaging, and here are just a few solutions for consumers craving alternatives to traditional packaging.

Produce is one of the first food groups to lose its luster after only a few days in the refrigerator   or on a shelf. Strawberries are notorious for being finicky, waiting to adorn a special dessert or just to be popped into one s mouth.

Tufts University biomedical engineers may have the answer to the fast fruit-rot dilemma. Engineers found that fruits can stay fresh for more than a week without refrigeration if coated in an odorless, nearly invisible biocompatible silk solution. Fibroin, an insoluble protein found in silk, has the ability to stabilize and protect other materials while being fully biocompatible and biodegradable.

Fresh strawberries were dipped in a solution of 1% silk fibroin protein. After repeating the process, the coated fruit was treated with water vapor under vacuum (water annealed) to create varying percentages of crystalline beta-sheets in the coating.

The coated berries were stored at room temperature and dipped in varying numbers of coats of silk that had been annealed at different times and then compared with uncoated berries. Tests showed the silk coating prolonged freshness by slowing fruit respiration, extending fruit firmness and preventing decay.

A new 100% compostable wrapper by Sheffa Foods adorns its coffee house-inspired granola bars. Bio-based and renewable, the flexible package is designed to break down and fully return to nature, becoming part of the food waste stream.

Co-founder Leslie Angle believes that natural food products deserve natural food packaging. The new packaging material decomposes in controlled conditions in less than 180 days. If discarded in a landfill, it will break down like an orange peel and in a  reasonable amount  of time, compared to traditional plastic packaging that decomposes only after hundreds of years.

AIMPLAS (aimplas.net) has coordinated the research to develop new sustainable packages extending the shelf life of cheese and fresh pasta within the framework of the European project BIO4MAP. The result has been a new generation of barrier, multilayer and transparent packages with a 25% lower cost than conventional ones, lower environmental impact and lower carbon footprint by up to 29%.

The layers of bioplastics (PLA, PVOH and adhesives) and a wax coating obtained from olive leaves has made possible, insulating the product from oxygen and humidity in order to avoid the growth of bacteria and fungi.

NatureWorks (natureworksllc.com) and Metalvuoto (metalvuoto.it) released a new line of high-barrier Ingeo-based flexible substrates designed to keep processed foods fresh on store shelves   specifically, for flexible packaging. Though used for years in fresh food packaging, this is the first application for longer shelf-life foods packaged in flat, stand up or square-bottom pouches.

The Metalvuoto film allows using a two-layer pouch with performance matching that of three-layer pouches. The Oxaqua coating technology claims to provide excellent barrier as well as heat seal-ability.

Although many brand owners are interested in reviewing their existing packaging to see how its environmental profile can be improved, there are several obstacles to taking it all the way to a bio-based material.

The biggest positive driver is the opportunity bio-based polymers present to brand owners to package products in materials that are as natural as the consumables they are protecting. With safety continuing to be a major consumer and governmental focal point, it is important to eliminate packaging components that might negatively impact the contents. Therefore, it s logical that the ideal goal would be to package food products in material that is derived from other food products.

While many are drawn to the perceived advantages, there are additional considerations that have to be part of the evaluation process. For example, bio-based materials do not lend themselves to the current recycling classification. A material such as PLA, which could be considered a PET substitute, cannot be recycled in the PET waste stream. Instead of the readily understood #1 designation, it would be labeled a #7, creating a potentially negative recycling scenario. Clearly, this is not desirable for brand owners.

The availability and economic viability of bio-based materials are also a significant consideration. Because the demand for these resins is relatively low, supplies are also low. Without volume to drive down cost, it is frequently cost-prohibitive to entertain conversion to these materials.","Packaging"
"New earth-friendly, reusable tin can for cannabis"," 
	Honest Marijuana Company packages cannabis in Earth-friendly, reusable tin cans that are brand-new to the industry.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89035-new-earth-friendly-reusable-tin-can-for-cannabis","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","New earth-friendly, reusable tin can for cannabisIn the marijuana marketplace, one company leads the sustainable cannabis cultivation forefront and is revolutionizing how cannabis is packaged and sold: Anthony Franciosi, founder of Honest Marijuana Company. Honest Marijuana Company packages cannabis in Earth-friendly, reusable tin cans that are brand-new to the industry. The cans keep the product extra fresh. And, they use all-natural growing methods to cultivate eco-conscious cannabis.

In contrast to the countless cannabis companies who package their product in disposable plastic containers, Honest Marijuana Company's cannabis is packaged and sold in recyclable tin cans with pure nitrogen to ensure only the highest level of integrity and quality. This environmentally sound packaging allows for the product to stay in its purest form and not be deteriorated by light or oxygen. Impermeable to oxygen and residual humidity, the tin cans are also inert to temperature fluctuations, meaning that they don't secrete any chemical compounds that will kill the fresh aroma of the cannabis terpenes. The cans preserve the cannabis flowers for years! With this revolutionary new packaging, Anthony hopes to inspire other cannabis companies to place a greater focus on sustainability and caring for Mother Earth.

Anthony Franciosi, founder of Honest Marijuana Company, started growing strains as a healthier way to relieve the pain from years of sports injuries, rather than ingest and possibly get addicted to pain killers. Using organic nutrients like kelp and fish food, the company's plants work symbiotically with the natural nutrients in the soil, so the plant reaches out and draws from the soil precisely what it needs, primarily iron and copper.

 After working in landscaping for many years, I decided to turn my passion for green living, all-natural marijuana cultivation, and holistic pain relief into a full-time career... I grew in a small facility focused on pesticide-free, organic methods, which I believe is the only option for connoisseur quality,  says Franciosi.

Through a ""top feeding"" method, Honest Marijuana Company ensures that 5% or less water is wasted in their facility. Their top-of-the-line sediment filter keeps sediment, chlorine and other harmful elements out of their water supply and out of the town's sewage system. The water chilled climate control system uses 30% less electricity than a standard HVAC system, and it also grabs wasted power and feeds it back into the system to be reused, resulting an additional 10% energy savings. When the external ambient temperature is below 45 degrees, their system is able to utilize the outside air and convert it into another 60-70% energy savings.","Packaging"
"Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger filler"," 
	Many of today's newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/88996-integrating-a-form-fill-seal-bag-machine-with-an-auger-filler","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Integrating a form-fill-seal bag machine with an auger fillerNew designs in food packaging are constantly being developed and introduced to consumers. While these new trends are sharp and eye-catching, product nevertheless needs to get inside   and that can be tricky at times with smaller openings and different packaging sizes.

Many of these newer package designs are still filled using a vertical form-fill-seal (VFFS) bag machine and auger filler. For food manufacturers and packagers, these machines are a major purchase that can take months to accurately specify, quote, build and deliver. The process can become easier by improving communication between the vendors and customer early in the design stages. This will make that process a much quicker and smoother experience for everyone involved   and deliver an FFS machine that s ready for action the first day it s installed.

One of the main components of the design process is the integration of the VFFS machine to an auger filler. These two pieces of equipment need to be in-sync with one another to properly deliver the desired performance for the customer s application.

To get started, the vendors and customer need to share basic information with each other including:

Knowing this information upfront helps vendors determine the scope of the project. It also allows the auger filler supplier to determine if the customer s desired performance specifications for the application can be achieved.

The reason to have answers to these questions in the early stages is that each one influences the other; if one of the answers to a question is unknown, it can change the scope of the project.

The size and shape of the forming tube is one of the most important pieces of information a filler vendor needs in designing a system to integrate with an FFS machine. The amount and speed of which the product can be filled depends largely on the diameter of the auger, and that is dictated by the diameter and shape of the forming tube.

Simple physics comes into play in determining the fill rate. Obviously the larger the forming tube, the more product that can be dispensed in a single auger revolution. For example, an auger that is 2   inches in diameter delivers 12.27 cubic inches of product per revolution, whereas an auger that s just a half inch larger in diameter delivers 24.74 cubic inches of product per revolution  twice as much. The size of the forming tube is of great interest to the filling machine vendor because the company wants to know how much space it has to work with inside that tube. Knowing this up front allows the supplier to determine if the specified speed can be met for the designed pouch size. If it does not, either the bag needs to be redesigned to a larger size or speed requirements must be reduced.

It is also important to review the flow characteristics for each product to be filled. In general, products are free flow or non-free flow, and each requires a different tooling setup. In some cases products can be a little of both, and the result is anything from an occasional drip to a steady stream of product flowing after the auger has completed its cycle. This may require a tooling set up that calls for a clam shell cut-off, a cone cut-off, or possibly the latest technology: vacuum cut-off. All three of these special tooling setups take up additional room in the form tube, causing the size of the auger and therefore, the output speed, to be reduced.

Dust removal is an area that also needs to be factored into the integration of the VFFS machine with the filling machine. Since the pouch is sealed on three sides, any dust from the fill will escape going up. If the application calls for dust collection, then dust collection is required to capture it, and it needs to be located within the forming tube   and that takes up valuable space.

Electrical specifications of each system are another area to consider. Often the end user will have an electrical specification that must be met. The filler supplier needs to know this upfront when quoting the project. There is also the possibility of the VFFS supplier and the filler supplier to share components. A good example of this would be to integrate control screens on a common HMI (human machine interface), thus giving the end user single-point control for the complete system. To do that effectively, it s best to approach this objective early on.

One final point on machine integration: Discuss the factory acceptance test up front during the quoting process. Will there be a test at the filler company, the bagger company or both? What are the criteria for these tests? Will the VFFS company require technical assistance from the filler supplier for the test? What are the criteria for the start, installation and training at the customer s plant? Technical assistance requirements should be defined and planned for in advance.

Bringing in all vendors together with the customer to discuss performance goals and share information early on in the design process will help streamline the integration between the FFS machine and filling machine. Vendors have expertise in their specific areas, and sharing information ensures all aspects of the integration will move along in a smooth and efficient manner.

"From challenges to opportunities: favorable climate for the plastics industry"," 
	The plastics industry in ASEAN remains untroubled by global developments that are also impacting the growth path of key industries.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89034-from-challenges-to-opportunities-favorable-climate-for-the-plastics-industry","Sat, 13 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","From challenges to opportunities: favorable climate for the plastics industryThe plastics industry in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nation) remains untroubled by global developments that are also impacting the growth path of key industries. With K 2016, the world s largest trade fair for plastics and rubber, coming up in D sseldorf, Germany (October 19-26, 2016), here is a closer look at this market.

The new norm of economic growths and trends such as oil prices, variable supply and demand, and weakening of most Asian currencies against the US dollar, have allowed the region s countries to rediscover their strengths to sustain growth either individually or as a part of the collective grouping of the 10-member ASEAN, which comprises Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, Brunei, Vietnam, Laos, Myanmar and Cambodia.

ASEAN s fertile consumer base with a combined population of over 600 million and a combined GDP of US$ 2.6 trillion, as well as presence in the global market, enables the region to tap the right opportunities, hinging on the region s rising middle class sector.

One of ASEAN s top export sectors by value is plastics and plastic products earning US$ 39.3 billion in export revenues in 2013.

The sector s production rates have witnessed a steady average growth over the recent years, especially in the ASEAN-6: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam, which account for more than 95 % of regional GDP, according to McKinsey & Company.

Vietnam s relatively promising plastics industry had an average annual growth of 16-18 % between 2010 and 2015. Packaging accounts for 37.4 %, followed by consumer goods (27 %), construction (18 %) and technical products (15 %). Yet, the industry is still at the  low end and of low value , according to Vietnam Plastics Association (VPA), with a majority of exports being plastic bags to Japan. It also relies heavily on imported raw materials, like polypropylene (PP) and polyethylene (PE) resins, importing an average of 4 million tons of raw materials while domestic production totals 1 million tons.

Meanwhile, with a population of over 250 million, Indonesia s government has increased efforts to industrialize and develop the nation towards becoming the world s seventh largest economy by 2030. Its rising middle class, expected to double to 141 million people within the next five years, will drive plastics consumption. According to the Indonesian Packaging Association, food packaging accounts for 70 % of plastic consumption sales. The Aromatic, Olefin and Plastic Industry Association (Inaplas) has set a 6 % growth in domestic demand for the plastics sector, sustained by an improving GDP of 5.3 % in 2016 and upbeat food and beverage and agribusiness sectors.

One of ASEAN s top exporters of plastic products, Malaysia has more than 1,500 plastic production companies that export to Europe, China, Singapore, Japanand Thailand. The packaging sector accounts for 45 % of the total plastic consumption market, followed by electronics (26 %), automotive (10 %) and construction industry (8 %). However, due to a rise in Malaysia s minimum wage to US$ 214 per month, plastic production costs have increased within the country by approximately 10 % over the course of 2015.

Thailand s plastic consumption is led by packaging (48 %), electronics (15 %), construction (14 %), and automotive (8 %). Its automotive sector attracts manufacturing opportunities, although its overall cost index (for example, energy, labor, and property) is 20 to 25 % higher than Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines, largely because of a high quality and mature automotive manufacturing ecosystem, including tiered suppliers of automotive components. The country has also invested US$ 60 million into bioplastics development over the past seven years, with the government supplying 80 % of this investment.

Export-oriented Philippines has witnessed weak exports performance, down by 5.8 % in the previous year, because of low demand from its top buyers: the US, China and Japan. The semiconductor and electronics industries account for the majority of the country s exports. Various measures are being instituted to boost exports, such as the Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) of the European Union (EU) that is offering export opportunities to the Philippines by allowing less or no duties on exports to the EU.

Meanwhile, global chemicals hub Singapore, which has been voted the world s most expensive city for expatriates for the third consecutive year by the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU), offsets its high costs by offering strong connectivity through shipping routes, a developed infrastructure, manpower capabilities and ease of doing business.

Around 95 companies are represented on Singapore s Jurong Island, attracting investments in excess of S $35 billion, according to the Economic Development Board. Providing a plug-and-play environment, the island allows companies to quickly ramp up their operations, helping growth in both upstream and downstream sectors. Presently, companies like BASF, ExxonMobil Chemical, Lanxess, Mitsui Chemicals, Shell and Sumitomo Chemicals have plants. However, BMI Research expects Singapore to face an uphill climb in 2016, in the face of a Chinese downturn and regional oversupply. Thus, the country is counting on the specialty chemical sector as the next growth area, according to the Economic Survey of Singapore by the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI).

Pushing the region s plastics industry further, initiatives are being laid out by plastics trade associations, including the ASEAN Federation of Plastics Industries (AFPI), the Malaysian Plastics Manufacturers Association (MPMA), the Thai Plastic industries Association (TPIA), and the Philippines Plastics Industry Association (PPIA). The associations are working together with international-scale trade agreement blocs, including the ASEAN Economic Community (AEC), the US-led Trans Pacific Partnership Agreement (TPPA), and the China-backed Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).

The AEC, which went into effect on January 1, includes liberalization of goods, investments and services and will enable plastic producing countries like Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore to lower duties on finished plastic products, machines and molds to other member countries like Vietnam, which buys about 80 % of its plastic materials requirements from Thailand and Malaysia.

Indonesia also imports more than 40% of its plastics requirements from Malaysia, Thailand, Singapore, Europe and the US.

The US-led 12-nation TPPA will liberalize trade regulations between the member countries and also eliminate tariffs as high as 25%. The easier access to overseas markets also has benefits for the countries.

The RCEP, made up of ASEAN members, China, Japan, South Korea, India, Australia and New Zealand, aims to consolidate the existing ASEAN FTAs and alliance with the other six partner economies. It will impose a 65 % tariff cut, with the percentage likely to increase to 80 % within a decade. The RCEP could also usher into the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) s long-time prospect of creating a Free Trade Area in the Asia Pacific (FTAAP).

With these optimistic developments, the ASEAN plastics industry will witness an expansion. In the ASEAN Business Outlook Survey 2014, by the American Chamber of Commerce Singapore and US Chamber of Commerce, Indonesia ranked as the most attractive country for new business expansion, followed by Vietnam, Thailand, and Myanmar. Availability of low-cost labor in countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam, renders a competitive advantage. Overall, ASEAN s growing consumer bases, broadening of plastic import and export markets, and expanding foreign trading powers offers foreign investors significant opportunities.

Flexible packaging products uses more than 70% less plastics than rigid packaging options and also consumes smaller space during packaging and on shelves in retail outlets. Flexible packaging also offers a number of sustainability advantages including low raw material consumption, low carbon footprint, reduced energy usage, and relatively low waste produced as compared to conventional packaging formats and hence, are more preferred. These sustainability advantages offered by flexible packaging are expected to drive its demand over the forecast period. As competition intensifies in consumer products market, product manufacturers and brand owners are identifying as well as capitalize the latent potential in the market.

Changing consumer lifestyle has increased dependence on processed, pre-cooked and packed foods, which also mobilized the entire flexible packaging supply chain to sync product offering as per end customer's requirement. On similar lines, the industry also witnessed introduction of new and efficient films that are used in flexible packaging. Modified Atmosphere Packaging (MAP), vacuum skin packaging are some of the current trending packaging solutions which have been developed to meet end customer demand.

The global flexible packaging market is segmented on the basis of material type, product type and application. On the basis of material type, the global flexible packaging market is segmented into polymer, paper, aluminum and cellulose. Polymer material is further sub-segmented into polyethylene, polypropylene, biaxially-oriented polypropylene (BOPP), cast polypropylene, biaxially-oriented polypropylene terephthalate (BOPET), ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polyamide, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene. On the basis of product type, the global flexible packaging market is segmented into stand-up pouches, vacuum pouches, retort pouches, gusseted bags, wicketed bags, converted roll stock, squeezable bottles and others. Among products, vacuum pouches and retort pouches are projected to be the most attractive segment over the forecast period.

On the basis of application, the global flexible packaging market is segmented into consumer product applications and industrial & institutional product application. Regionally, the global flexible packaging market is segmented into North America, Latin America, Europe, Asia Pacific (APAC) and Middle East and Africa (MEA).

Among materials, polymer segment accounts for a major share in the global market. However, BOPP, BOPET and EVOH sub-segment in the polymer segment is expected to expand at highest CAGR in terms of value over the forecast period. Leading players in flexible packaging market are shifting their focus from conventional plastic packaging to sustainable packaging solutions due to the stringent environmental regulations, aimed to limit carbon footprint. Asia Pacific is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of over 8% in terms of value over the forecast period.

Properties offered by flexible packaging, identified as a crucial parameter which influences consumer's buying behaviour, hence, are more preferred by brand owners and manufacturers. Increasing disposable income in developed and developing countries is another factor driving consumer spending on high end premium goods viz. a viz. flexible packaging market.","Packaging"
"P28 revives packaging with a little help"," 
	The P28 brand is all about changing the game, and they needed a package redesign and a decoration method to go along with that notion.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89032-p28-revives-packaging-with-a-little-help","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","P28 revives packaging with a little helpThe P28 brand is all about changing the game, and they needed a package redesign and a decoration method to go along with that notion. TricorBraun (tricorbraun.com) was commissioned and created a true game changer for the high-protein spread.

The company was launched by three brothers in the baking business who decided they needed to get in shape and lose weight. Initially, they turned to an exercise and nutrition program; but when that didn't produce the results they were looking for, they turned to their personal trainer who was also a nutritionist. The brothers plus one joined forces and in 2008, they introduced a bread and the original-high protein spread.

Originally, the high-protein spread was packaged in a 'peanut butter style' jar and wasn't well differentiated nor was it disruptive on shelf. According to Jeff Prince, director of operations at P28,  We wanted to get away from being just another typical spread jar on the shelf. With P28, we are always looking to change the game. We're always looking to be original and offer our customers high quality, innovative products. We wanted that same idea to hold true in our packaging. 

Prince goes on to say,  We chose TricorBraun because of their game changing design capabilities, the quality of their work and their top notch communication.  The process at TricorBraun began with the discovery phase. This allowed the team to clearly comprehend, define and help P28 realize their vision. Many things were taken into consideration including brand, competitive landscape, technical restraints and success criteria.

It was clear that the package needed to be a PET 16 oz. jar and that there were seven SKUs but according to Prince,  We were searching for something unique, exciting and high quality that screamed pick me up! If the consumer picked up the jar just to feel the difference in the structure, we knew this would ultimately lead them to reading about our product and its benefits. 

According to Samantha Juna, package design manager, TricorBraun,  We looked at a variety of shapes, closures and different deco methods including labeling vs. shrink sleeving the bottle; but the big turning point came when we agreed to play up the sports angle and truly differentiate from a regular peanut butter. We explored surface changes, more pronounced textures and athletic silhouettes. We took inspiration from some of the sports drinks on the market.  She explains further,  We essentially left the peanut butter category and went to nutraceutical. 

About the time of reaching design freeze, TricorBraun's graphic design manager Molly Fuehrmeyer was revamping the current graphics and applying them to the structure for visualization.  The goal was to highlight the attributes of the shape of the bottle and we were confident that a shrink sleeve would be the best deco method to capture the vignette on the arch,  she explains.

Fuehrmeyer adds,  The first approach was to take the original artwork and conservatively make it work with the new structure but P28 felt that a more playful look was needed while retaining the established SKU colors and the logo positioning.  The final artwork includes opaque areas where the text is clearly readable. This leads to a vignette that accentuates the shape and then a clear arch that reveals how much product is left. It was important for the flavors: almond butter, signature blend, white chocolate, banana raisin, caramel turtle, peanut butter and apple crisp to be very visible on shelf.

After a year in the making, the product was launched in the summer of 2015 and in 2016, the package design recently won the PAC  Global Leadership Award: Silver in the Food & Beverage Brand Revitalization category.

TricorBraun orchestrated the process with multiple outside suppliers. The bottle is manufactured by Pretium, the stock closure is from PANO and the shrink sleeve is done by Metro Label. The bottles are filled by P28 and can be found in retail in the US at all Vitamin Shoppe locations, 800+ Wal-Mart locations, all Wegmans and thousands of others. In Canada, the product can be found at Popeye's and online at SupplementSource.ca and SupplementsCanada.com.

P28 Foods is a high-protein food company located in Syracuse, NY. Founded by third-generation bakers, the company is dedicated to providing our customers the most delicious and nutritious high protein food products available.","Packaging"

The IMDA is an association of injection molders, printers and suppliers of materials and machines used for in-mold decorating. In the 10th edition of the awards this year, market leader Verstraete IML from Maldegem won awards in the following categories: Best Thin Wall Packaging, Best Blow Molded Package and Best Product Family. As a result, Verstraete IML took home three of the eight awards.

IMDA Symposium sets the tone

 In early June, Verstraete IML received the IMDA awards during the 2016 IMDA Symposium at the Franklin Marriott Cool Springs hotel in Tennessee. Peter Paelinck, business development manager North America, states,  The IMDA Symposium is an annual event which is eagerly anticipated by every company in the IML packaging industry. It is the perfect place to brush up on your skills in the area of in-mould labelling (IML) and in-mould decorating (IMD). What's more, you can attend interesting workshops and get an opportunity to network with IML specialists from around the world. Verstraete IML is very honoured to receive three awards on this occasion. 

Best Thin Wall Packaging - Gold for Unilever

 Unilever's margarine containers and lids underwent a thorough makeover. They are now made with paper-thin walls which meet the most stringent technical requirements. Unilever switched from direct printing to in-mould labelling. And they changed the shape of the containers - from round to rectangular - to save valuable space during transportation and on shop shelves. Thanks to the photographic quality of the IML labels and the seven different sizes, the four brands now occupy a unique market position. In addition, the re-branding of Unilever's margarine brands proceeded smoothly due to the excellent cooperation between Verstraete IML and the three injection moulders RPC BRAMLAGE-Wiko USA, PSPM and Berry Plastics.

Best Blow Moulded Package - Gold for Taanayel

 The Lebanese dairy giant Taanayel Les Fermes, known for its natural, authentic and traditional dairy products, exchanged its glass Balan Baladi packaging for blow moulding using IML. The vintage design of the packaging enhances the authentic nature of the product. IML for blow moulding is the perfect packaging technology for dairy products. The IML labels from Verstraete IML are moisture-proof and can withstand temperature fluctuations. This makes them an ideal solution for decorating synthetic packaging for refrigerated products.

Best Product Family - Silver for Berry Plastics

 Berry Plastics  SelecTE  product group is a range of high-quality rectangular, sealed packaging provided with three-sided or five-sided IML labels. Thanks to the way in which this packaging is decorated, the quality of the food product is clearly visible to the consumer through the transparent sections of the packaging and there is also enough free space to attract consumers with the excellent graphical quality of the label. The entire packaging is 100% recyclable. The container, the lid and the label are all made of polypropylene. The IML label can also be printed on transparent material or in a metallic look to draw greater attention to the brand on the shop shelves.

Supplier of IML labels and professional expertise

 Verstraete In-Mould Labels has more than 25 years of experience in offset printing labels on polypropylene for injection moulding, blow moulding and thermoforming. The company produces more than 45 million in-mould labels every day for various segments of the packaging industry.

	Sagamore Spirit is marking a new entry into the American whiskey marketplace with the introduction of its premium Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Whiskey. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89027-sagamore-spirit-introduces-new-premium-straight-rye-whiskey","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Sagamore Spirit introduces new premium straight rye whiskeySagamore Spirit is marking a new entry into the American whiskey marketplace with the introduction of its premium Sagamore Spirit Straight Rye Whiskey in three major markets in the United States Maryland, Washington, DC and Delaware with New York to follow shortly.

 Maryland has a deep history and heritage with distilling rye whiskey that dates back to before Prohibition,  says Brian Treacy, president of Sagamore Spirit.  Maryland was home to more than 40 distilleries and we honor that tradition by making a spirit worthy of our state s distilling heritage. 

To help create an innovative and beautiful package which would adhere closely to the new premium spirit s quality taste and smooth finish, it called upon Saxco International LLC (saxco.com) of Horsham, PA, world-wide packaging specialists for the wine, spirits, beer and food industries and its vast global resource network to assist.  Our role was to help create an attractive and colorful new package that would also deliver a prominent and distinctive shelf presence and bring the project to a successful conclusion,  states Beth-Anne Kline, regional sales manager for Saxco International, who coordinated on the project with Saxco s Eric Guli, supply chain project manager.

Working closely with Sagamore s brand management team, along with creative collaboration between Sagamore Creative, of Baltimore, MD and Ptarmak, of Austin, TX, Saxco helped create a high-quality custom mold. The mold included a diamond shaped 750ml flint bottle with flat shoulders and embossed logos on the front, back and heavy glass bottom. Saxco then provided a reliable, time-tested overseas source to produce the bottle which incorporates embossed 1909 logos on the front and back and a three diamond logo on the bottom. The 1909 logo signifies the year the Sagamore Farm Springhouse was built, where Sagamore Spirit draws water to cut their rye whiskey to 83-proof.  The farm is built on a shelf of limestone rock and limestone water makes for some of the best rye whiskey you can have,  explains Treacy.

Saxco also supplied a rich looking custom black wood top natural cork assembly for the bottle s closure from a longtime quality supply source in Portugal. The wood top has a three diamond logo imprinted on the top. The closure was over fitted with a burgundy and black capsule from one of Saxco s long time trusted suppliers in California.

 

 The tricolor pressure sensitive labels were completed by a Sagamore Spirit source and hand applied to each bottle. Every bottle is hand labeled with a batch number, bottler number and signed by the bottler.

Sagamore Straight Rye Whiskey is 83-proof and 41.5 percent alcohol by volume and is being bottled in Baltimore, Maryland. The distilling team blends two different mash bills, a high rye and a low rye and then adds the Sagamore Farm spring-fed water to cut the whiskey to proof.","Packaging"
"Global ampoules packaging market to grow through 2020"," 
	Emergence of sustainable materials will accelerate the growth of ampoules packaging through 2020.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89023-global-ampoules-packaging-market-to-grow-through-2020","Wed, 10 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Global ampoules packaging market to grow through 2020According to the latest research report released by Technavio, the global ampoules packaging market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 8% until 2020.

  Increased environmental concerns among consumers have increased the demand for sustainable packaging materials, thereby influencing the ampoule packaging market. Ampoules are made of conventional plastics, which do not decompose easily. Vendors are adopting sustainable materials to reduce the dependency on conventional plastics and adopt eco-friendly practices. The emergence of green plastics or biodegradable plastics will fuel the growth of the market during the forecast period,  says Sharan Raj, a lead industry analysts for packaging at Technavio.



  These plastics made from petrochemicals and contain biodegradable additives. They can be easily decomposed by microorganisms and produce less toxic gasses compared to conventional plastics. Increased use of materials, including polyvinyl alcohol, polyanhydrides and polylactic acid by plastic packaging manufacturers will reduce the market share of conventional plastics. Vendors in ampoules packaging are increasingly using biodegradable plastics to comply with stringent environmental regulations,  says Sharan.

Some of the other driving forces behind the growth of the global ampoules packaging market are as follows:

Increased prevalence of chronic diseases and infections

 Increased prevalence of chronic diseases (e.g., cancer and tuberculosis) and non-communicable diseases (e.g., diabetes and cardiovascular diseases) serves the ampoules packaging market as a driver. According to International Diabetes Federation (IDF), the global prevalence of diabetes is projected to reach 592 million by 2035.

In addition, the number of patients with infectious respiratory, gastrointestinal, and sexually transmitted diseases (HIV infection and AIDS) as well as hospital-acquired infections (such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) has also increased.

Rising number of chronic diseases are increasing the demand for vaccines and anti-thrombotic drugs in the market. Owing to these developments, the global market for antithrombotic drugs is projected to reach U.S. $21.6 billion by the end of 2018. Thus, the increased prevalence, early diagnosis and regular monitoring of chronic diseases is likely to increase the demand for ampoules packaging during the forecast period.

Strict government regulations and standards

 Strict government regulations and industry standards for packaging of pharmaceutical related products have resulted in a positive impact on the market. According to FDA regulations in the U.S., pharmaceutical solutions or drugs need high barrier packaging materials and sealants that are impermeable and resistant to solvents, grease, chemicals, and heat. Government regulations in developed countries such as Japan and European countries demand greater barrier and security protection of medical supplies and devices. In addition, for the supply medical products produced nationally to the domestic and international markets, governments in developing countries such as China and India have upgraded their industry standards for ampoule packaging to maintain quality, safety, and reduce breakage, spillage, and contamination. Thus, strict regulations and standards for packaging of pharmaceutical related products are expected to fuel the growth of the ampoules packaging market until 2020.



 Significant growth in emerging countries

 The global ampoules product manufacturers are focusing on emerging countries such as Brazil, Russia, India, China (BRIC) to expand their operations. The governments are taking initiatives to build healthcare infrastructures and increase healthcare budgets. They are also focusing on the improvement of diagnostic procedures. Due to air pollution and water contamination, there has been an increase in the prevalence of chronic and infectious diseases. BRIC countries represent an attractive market for multi-national corporations in the healthcare industry owing to the rising awareness among consumers about chronic and infectious diseases. For instance, in 2011, Russian manufacturing, packaging, and R&D division received an assurance from the Association of International Pharmaceutical Manufacturers to invest a minimum amount of $1 billion. Novartis is also investing $500 million by 2016. In addition, Novo Nordisk, Nycomed, and Sanofi have also expanded their businesses in Russia. Other pharmaceutical companies like Roche have partnered with local pharmaceutical companies under out-licensing agreements. All these factors will fuel the global ampoules packaging market in the forecast period.","Packaging"

Effective Aug. 29, Laura Flanagan will assume the titles of president and CEO.

The appointment by the company s board of directors concludes a 22-month search to replace Ron Foster, who led the firm since 2003. Foster announced he would step down in October 2014. He will remain as a board member and owner.

In a prepared statement, Foster called Flanagan  the ideal executive to guide Foster Farms during a period of significant growth. She has an impressive record of transforming and growing household consumer brands across an ever-shifting landscape. 

For the last eight years, Flanagan has served as a division head at Conagra, first as president of the convenient meals division and then president of the snacks division. She also led initiatives to promote diversity, build skills and capabilities and develop internal talent.

Flanagan began her career as a manufacturing engineer at Saturn Corp. After earning a MBA from Stanford, she assumed brand management positions at General Mills and Pepsico, including a stint as vice president and chief marketing officer of Pepsico s Tropicana shelf stable juices operations. She serves as a director of Core-Mark International, a supplier to convenience stores.

Livingston, Calif.-based Foster Farms employs more than 12,000 and is ranked among the U.S. s 10 largest poultry and turkey processors. The company also has a dairy processing division. Foster Farms ranks No. 199 on Forbe s list of America s largest private companies with 2015 revenues of $2.3 billion.

A grandson of the company s founders, Foster had a tumultuous ride as the firm s CEO. Sales grew 70 percent under his leadership, and Foster Farms became the largest provider of organic and antibiotic-free fresh chicken on the West Coast. In 2010, it became the first major poultry processor to be certified by the American Humane Association. The firm received a Gold Effie Award for its  Say No to Plumping  campaign, an effort to deny all-natural labeling for chickens injected with a brine solution to add up to 15 percent in total weight.

In recent years, the company s chicken was linked to an 18-month outbreak of Salmonella Heidelberg that affected consumers in 29 states and Puerto Rico. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed more than 600 illnesses attributable to the chicken, though some estimates put the total at more than 10,000.

"An Entrepreneur s Guide to Food Industry Success","  Quench Your Own Thirst  tells the story of Sam Adams &amp; Co. and the nonlinear growth of the craft beer movement that Jim Koch played a central role in instigating. It s also a useful how-to guide to creating a food company with integrity and managing it through the peaks and valleys of the business cycle. ","http://www.foodprocessing.com/blogs/thescoop/an-entrepreneurs-guide-to-food-industry-success/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 15:37:00 -0400","NA","An Entrepreneur s Guide to Food Industry SuccessAdvice is cheap, but advice from a successful food industry entrepreneur is worth a listen by the thousands of start-ups that have burst onto the scene in recent years.

The entrepreneur in question is Jim Koch, founder and brewer of Sam Adams beer. He s also former president and CEO of Boston Beer Company Inc., the company that did for craft beer what hundreds of food start-ups are trying to do for free-from and better-for-you products that are trying to: disrupt the food & beverage mainstream.

Thirty-two years after he left a safe and stolid job as a management consultant and 31 years after selling his first 4,000 cases to Boston bars and restaurants, Koch s  Quench Your Own Thirst: Business Lessons Learned Over a Beer or Two  has been published by Flatiron Books.

It s become almost standard practice for food start-ups to focus on sales and marketing while farming out production to a copacker. It was somewhat unusual in 1984, particularly in the craft beer business. While his contemporaries were committing limited capital into equipment and then fighting an often losing battle to gain distribution, Koch and his partner drafted a hit list of 100 Boston watering holes with clientele deemed adventurous enough to sample a richer, fresher tasting brew than the existing market could offer. By the time he took delivery of the first batch order from Pittsburgh Brewing Co. in April 1985, he was well on the way to converting every surviving bar and restaurant on that list to a Sam Adams customer.

Patience, a superior product and a high-touch sales force were crucial components.  It took four years to get the formulation right,  says Koch,  and drinkers might love it or hate it, but nobody said  It s just another beer.  No one would mistake a Sam Adams for a Bud or Coors. It was a revolution to the taste buds of the drinker. 

Retail distributors weren t interested in carrying a product without any advertising behind it. Koch couldn t afford six-pack cartons, anyway, making foodservice the distribution channel of necessity. A company s culture and values in this case, a commitment to better beer--can be leveraged to form personal relationships, he reasoned.  I didn t have a lot of money or resources, but I had table tents, and I took the time and effort to put them up in bars and restaurants after asking in a nice and thoughtful way and explaining,  This will help you make money.  We were David for so long, and people want to support the little guy. 

Sales reps also asked managers to put Boston Lager on the back bar, at eye level.  Eye level boosts sales 60 percent, and there is no amount of advertising you can do to boost sales 60 percent,  he says. The same request would later be made to retailers.  They would shift Bud below, and if you asked them why, they d say,  Because August Busch never came into my store.  

Even after three decades, Koch continues to call on retailers and foodservice managers one or two days a week.  It can be demanding and grueling,  he allows, but  when the guy who actually makes the product visits, it has an impact.  It also provides an understanding of how that customer makes money.

Continuous innovation and a refusal to rest on one s laurels also have been critical to Boston Beer s success. In 1988, the firm pioneered freshness dating, buying back and destroying the equivalent in today s dollars of $6 million of out-of-code beer from distributors. Long before other brewers recognized drinkers  thirst for variety, specialty and seasonal styles joined Sam in the lineup. Other craft brewers may look down their noses at reduced calorie beer or malternatives like Twisted Tea, but that last product rings up $200 million in annual sales.

 The rest of the world is looking to the United States for innovation and quality in beer,  says Koch. Every month, he hosts German brewers who visit to learn  how are we able to get 20-somethings excited about beer. Beer is boring in Germany,  where young adults are turning to wine, instead.

Based on the book s disparagement of marketing, you d suspect Koch had a bad encounter with a marketer as a child. Nonetheless, pull-through marketing in the form of advertising and promotion is one of Boston Beer s distinguishing features. It s unclear who actually coined the term craft beer, but there s no question who popularized it. Thirteen months after introducing Sam to the market, Koch was promoting it on WBCN radio as part of a barter deal.  Take whatever publicity we can get and always look for more  was the simple strategy. Ten years later, the first ads aired on TV.

The conventional wisdom holds that successful food startups eventually are acquired by large corporations, where ingredient compromises and production shortcuts gradually degrade the end product. The alternative scenario is a public stock offering that results in the founder s loss of control. Koch rewrote that script in 1995 with an IPO in which he retained all the voting shares, a tactic copied by Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook and Google s Sergey Brin and Larry Page. In the process, he stuck a finger in Wall Street s eye, giving 130,000 drinkers an opportunity to buy shares at a price $5 a share below the opening-day price paid by institutional investors.

Conventional wisdom also suggests that, beyond a certain point, entrepreneurs must turn control over to professional managers. While he gave up the titles of president and CEO long ago, he remains firmly in control as chairman of a $1 billion company. Citing the example of Steve Jobs and others, Koch notes,  It s turned out that founder-led companies have tended to outperform other companies. 

 Quench Your Own Thirst  tells the story of Sam Adams & Co. and the nonlinear growth of the craft beer movement that Koch played a central role in instigating. It s also a useful how-to guide to creating a food company with integrity and managing it through the peaks and valleys of the business cycle.","F&B"
"New Study Proves no Adverse Effects of Carrageenan","Two years of research finds no inflammation in human cells.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/new-study-proves-no-adverse-effects-of-carrageenan/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 13:45:00 -0400","NA","New Study Proves no Adverse Effects of CarrageenanA new study on carrageenan, an ingredient key to delivering stability, texture and nutrients in many foods and beverages, demonstrates the ingredient does not induce inflammation in human cells as claimed by some critics.

The study, which was conducted by internationally recognized toxicologist and carrageenan expert Dr. James M. McKim Jr., was recently accepted for publication by the peer-reviewed journal Food and Toxicology. This study represents the culmination of two years of research that was unable to replicate any of the findings of carrageenan critics, including Dr. Joanne Tobacman, who claim the food ingredient contributes to certain adverse health outcomes.

Publication of McKim's study raises major questions about the validity of Tobacman's conclusions and underscores the importance of replicating scientific results in different laboratories and by multiple researchers. McKim's research was designed to investigate several recent studies Tobacman has cited as evidence of her claims that carrageen causes inflammation and is harmful.

Not only was McKim unable to replicate the negative effects Tobacman reported, his research showed carrageenan has no measurable effects on cells and provides strong evidence that carrageenan consumed in foods and beverages would not cause inflammation in humans.","F&B"
"Dairy Farmers Ask USDA for Help With Cheese Glut","Dairy farmers saw milk prices have plunged to their lowest point in years, prompting them to request the USDA for assistance in buying up tens of thousands of tons of cheese.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/dairy-farmers-ask-usda-for-help-with-cheese-glut/","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 11:51:00 -0400","NA","Dairy Farmers Ask USDA for Help With Cheese GlutAs farmers' milk prices have plunged to their lowest point since October 2009, cheese stockpiles are swelling, which led dairy farmers to seek help from agricultural officials to buy up tens of thousands of tons of cheese to bail them out. On Aug. 12, Jim Mulhern, CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, Arlington, Va., sent a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, requesting that the government buy $150 million worth of cheese to assist the struggling dairy farmers, and provide 90 million lb. of food to needy Americans, the Wall Street Journal reported.

""Dairy producers here in the United States need assistance,"" wrote Mulhern. A spokesman for the USDA said the regulatory body ""shares the concerns for our nation s dairy farmers, who like many in the farm community are facing tight margins,"" and that the department would review the letter.

While dairy processors have been able to wrangle low milk costs to higher profitability in recent quarters, milk prices for farmers plunged 13 percent in the past year to around $1.25 a gallon, amid a barnyard-wide glut in agricultural commodities, the WSJ report added. Favorable weather in the U.S. and skyrocketing production globally have kept prices down on staple grains as well as the milk and the meat of animals that feed on them.

The farmers' problems mounted after the USDA forecast record corn and soybean harvests this fall, a bounty that likely would push down prices even further. In addition, stockpiles of cheeses from cheddar to feta have swelled in June to a record 1.25 billion lbs.

Such buyouts have occurred in the past when the USDA purchased other commodities such as peanuts and chicken after an avian influenza outbreak triggered an export ban that decimated U.S. poultry prices. Warehousing millions of pounds of cheese across the country can keep it frozen for years as dairy processors hold out for higher prices. Officials often distribute such surpluses to U.S. school-lunch programs, food banks or develop new products featuring cheese as a component.

""This type of assistance would both help economically strapped farmers, and also help those without ready access to nutritious dairy products,"" Mulhern's letter stated on behalf of the federation s members.","F&B"

"Complaints Filed Over Danone's White Wave Purchase","The Cornucopia Institute is contesting the acquisition of WhiteWave Foods by  Groupe Danone as being anti-competitive in the U.S. organic milk and organic yogurt markets.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/complaints-filed-over-danones-white-wave-purchase/","Fri, 12 Aug 2016 12:49:00 -0400","NA","Complaints Filed Over Danone's White Wave PurchaseThe proposed acquisition by French food giant Groupe Danone of WhiteWave Foods is being contested by an industry watchdog, the Cornucopia Institute, which says the move ""will have a serious anti-competitive effect on the organic yogurt and organic fluid milk markets in the U.S.""

The Wisconsin-based institute filed complaints with both the Federal Trade Commission and the Department of Justice, stating the acquisition would also have a negative economic impact on U.S. organic dairy farmers.

At a purchase price exceeding $10 billion, the deal would combine Stonyfield, Horizon and Wallaby to dominate the organic dairy market. Horizon organic milk controls nearly 25 percent of the organic milk market, while its Silk brand is a leader in plant-based beverages. Danone would be taking control of a bigger piece of the organic dairy market than has ever been controlled by a single company before, says the institute, which also launched a petition drive pushing for a full investigation of the proposed merger by federal regulators.

""With this acquisition, we are concerned that Danone will easily be able to beat out any competition by lowering prices beyond what farmstead dairies, and more moderately sized milk processors and marketers, can withstand,"" said Marie Burcham, a livestock policy analyst with the Cornucopia Institute, a nonprofit organization representing farms and consumers with interests in the organic dairy market.

The market for organic dairy already has less competition than other agricultural sectors and is more susceptible to monopolization, Burcham continued. ""It is important that the authorities look at the anti-competitive implications of the Danone-WhiteWave deal,"" she added. ""We ask that they consider the organic dairy and organic yogurt markets in particular as different and already more concentrated markets in comparison to Danone s other, non-organic market share.""","F&B"

"Hampton Creek Ran Secret Buy-Back in First Year","Vegan mayonnaise company told workers, contractors to quietly buy hundreds of jars of Just Mayo to inflate sales.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/hampton-creek-buyback/","Mon, 08 Aug 2016 15:27:00 -0400","NA","Hampton Creek Ran Secret Buy-Back in First YearVegan mayonnaise creator Hampton Creek Inc. pumped up first-year sales and general buzz by having employees and contractors buy up jars of its Just Mayo, according to an investigation by Bloomberg News.

The news medium reported Aug 4. it had uncovered payment receipts and talked to former employees and contractors who were told to go to Safeway and other early retailers of the product in 2014 and buy hundreds of jars and otherwise talk up the product while hiding the fact they were employed by Hampton Creek.

Entrepreneur/founder Josh Tetrick, who remains CEO of the company, admitted the tactic but said it amounts to about $77,000, representing less than 0.12 percent of the company s sales. Bloomberg hinted that it could be much more, but did not specify an amount.

Tetrick said the tactic was more about quality control than trying to inflate sales. He said the employees and contractors were told to check jars for misaligned labels, breakage or issues involving ingredient separation, which he said occurred early on when the pea protein spread was exposed to extreme temperatures in transit.

Whichever, it certainly helped Tetrick raise an early $90 million to fund his startup. We profiled Tetrick and Hampton Creek in a September 2015 cover story titled ""Hero or Hustler?"" -- a story that made Food Processing and Managing Editor Kevin Higgins a finalist in the coveted Jesse Neal Awards.

 We need you in Safeway buying Just Mayo and our new flavored mayos,  Caroline Love, Hampton Creek s then-director of corporate partnership, wrote in an April 2014 e-mail to contract workers, which Bloomberg obtained.  And we re going to pay you for this exciting new project! Below is the list of stores that have been assigned to you. 

Former workers say Hampton Creek also purchased its own products at Kroger, Costco, Walmart, Target and Whole Foods locations across the country. While a November 2014 e-mail from the corporate partnerships team said the company would stop store buyouts, three former contractors who worked for the company in 2015 say the practice continued, but directions became verbal, not written, according to Bloomberg.

Five former Hampton Creek contractors and two ex-senior staff members say the buyback assignments were separate from quality checks at stores. The ex-contractors say in most cases they were told to simply buy up jars at nearby stores and were free to consume or discard them, not look for quality issues, according to the Bloomberg story.

One former contractor provided receipts showing purchases of more than 140 jars of Just Mayo in a single day. Another contractor said he bought at least 20 jars per store after being directed to visit more than a dozen stores in less than a week.

In that crucial time period, from April 2014 to April 2015, Hampton Creek's grocery store sales were $4.6 million, not including sales at Whole Foods, according to an IRI report cited by Fast Company. Sales more than doubled the following year, and Tetrick told the magazine he expects $100 million in sales this year.

Since Hampton Creek is a privately held company, it may not have broken any laws.","F&B"

We don t mean to make this into some kind of competition, especially since the numbers you see involve some interpretation by us. But it is worth noting that Tyson unseated PepsiCo, which had held the No. 1 position on the chart for five years. This is not Tyson s first turn as the No. 1 company; the Arkansas firm in 2006 ended a 30-year run by Kraft Foods.

It s also a good scorecard for the general health of the food and beverage industry. Looking beyond the top-line sales figures tells a lot about the current state of business ... although generalizations are hard to come up with.

It s safe to call that a mixed bag, certainly not a stellar performance across the board. But it s never easy, is it? Even the star performers within the chart did well mostly because of sizable acquisitions. Tyson is one, its sales growing by more than 11 percent, although that $4 billion bump entirely may be due to its acquisition of Hillshire Brands. But its 43 percent increase in net income is a testament to its management of this big acquisition and the debt it involved.

J.M. Smucker is in the same two boats. Its $2 billion sales increase (thanks to its purchase of Big Heart Pet Brands) is great, but its nearly 100 percent increase in profit took real finesse.

Less worthy of compliment is Post Holdings  near-doubling of sales (due to the acquisitions of MOM Brands and Michael Foods), which only kept it $115 million in red ink.

Deal-making in the food and beverage industry set a new record in 2014, hitting 510. Despite being 18 percent lower, 410 transactions made last year was one of the busiest years for buying and selling food & beverage companies, according to records compiled by The Food Institute.

The number of food industry mergers may be down in 2015, but Mergermarket estimates the value of deals in the food segment reached a near-record high of $120.8 billion, jumping 57.8 percent from even that record prior year. What is causing this gap between transactions and value? Megadeals. Megadeals are becoming more popular as companies find the only way to keep their share of the market is to merge with the competition.

And 2015 saw its share of megadeals. The poster child was the merger of Kraft Foods and H.J. Heinz Co.

Smucker Co. s acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands for approximately $5.8 billion, Snyder's-Lance Inc. s purchase of Diamond Foods Inc., Post Holdings Inc. s deal for MOM Brands Co. and TreeHouse Foods  acquisition of ConAgra Foods' private label operations.

In the bakery category, Flowers Foods and Hearthside Food Solutions were the most active companies, each with two acquisitions. The largest deal was Flowers  acquisition of organic bread maker Dave's Killer Bread for approximately $275 million in cash. In confectionery, Hershey Co. bought jerky-maker Krave Pure Foods Inc., and Barry Callebaut Group purchased the assets of American Almond Products Co. Inc., a producer of artisanal nut-based ingredients.

One of the larger deals in the fruit & vegetable category was Del Monte Foods  acquisition of Sager Creek Vegetable Co. (formerly known as Allens Inc.) for $75 million. In meats, the big deal was JBS USA Pork s acquisition of Cargill's U.S. pork business for about $1.4 billion. In poultry, Perdue Farms bought Natural Food Holdings from LNK Partners, including the Niman Ranch and Prairie Grove brands.

In the Food Institute's ""other"" category, McCormick & Co. made three acquisitions, buying One World Foods for approximately $100 million, Brand Aromatics for $63 million, and Drogheria & Alimentari for approximately $97 million. Seafood processors were noticeably more active in 2015 than in previous years, taking part in almost as many deals in 2015 as in the previous five years combined, but all of them relatively small.

The Food Institute (www.foodinstitute.com), a nonprofit organization founded to collect and disseminate information about the industry, includes in its definition of the food industry a number of entities beyond food and beverage processors.","F&B"
"Top 100 Food and Beverage Companies for 2016: Lower Sales, Higher Profits","After a year of cost-cutting, many companies are improving their bottom lines at the expense of their top lines.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/top-100-food-companies/","Thu, 04 Aug 2016 09:27:00 -0400","NA","Top 100 Food and Beverage Companies for 2016: Lower Sales, Higher ProfitsUsually, our Top 100  table shows a healthy food and beverage industry with sales and profits on the rise   as should be expected in a year in which the country s overall economy is plugging along, albeit without setting records.

Look a little closer at the figures and the underlying situations, and we see an industry struggling to achieve growth. Especially among the bigger firms. Only one of the 16 largest companies saw sales grow appreciably in 2015, and that company, Tyson, did so mostly through a huge acquisition. All the others undoubtedly made some acquisitions in the past year, which didn t do enough to prop up sales.

Tyson, by the way, is the new No. 1 company atop the U.S. and Canadian food and beverage industry, thanks to the $4 billion bump by former No. 32 company Hillshire Brands. Tyson was No. 1 back in 2006, having ended about a 30-year run by Kraft Foods as the largest food & beverage processor in the U.S. and Canada. This time, it ended PepsiCo s five-year turn atop our list.

 We have an incredible team at Tyson Foods and our focus on consumer-relevant categories is what got us here,  CEO Donnie Smith told us when he learned of the No. 1 ranking.  We ve invested in our prepared foods brands, chicken and the insights that drive innovation for a better consumer experience. 

For the overall food and beverage industry, profits are a slightly better picture   maybe. Net income was up at five of the top 16   which means the bottom line worsened for eight. (No. 11 Mars is a private company and doesn t tell us profits and for No. 5 Kraft Heinz we had no 2014 figure to compare its profit to.)

As we prepared this report, AdvancePierre Foods was planning an initial public offering of stock. The six-year-old Cincinnati company was seeking to raise $100 million but it will remain majority-owned by Oaktree Capital. APF is the result of a 2010 merger of Pierre Foods, Advance Food Co. and Advance Brands   and Advance Brands itself was a joint venture between Advance Food Co. and Cargill Meat Solutions. Hostess Brands, which had a soap opera of bankruptcies in 2004 and 2012, was sold off in pieces in its 2013 liquidation. But the biggest part and the name went to investor C. Dean Metropoulos and his Apollo Global Management LLC. Now, in a complex transaction, Metropoulos and Apollo Global Management will transfer ownership to newly formed Gores Holdings, but they will hold a 42 percent stake in Gores Holdings. Gores Holdings reportedly plans to reintroduce Hostess as a publicly listed company, perhaps late this year, with an anticipated initial enterprise value of approximately $2.3 billion.

Mondelez is a great case in point. While the North American-only figures show a tiny improvement, worldwide sales were down nearly $5 billion; but net income nearly tripled from 2014 to a sensational $7.3 billion.

The view is only a little better at the bottom third of our table, where 12 of the 33 smaller companies gained sales ground and seven improved profits.

The figures punctuate the stories told at the Consumer Analysts Group of New York conference, where the top food and beverage companies annually make presentations to financial analysts. At that February meeting, the CEOs and CFOs of Campbell Soup, General Mills, Hormel and Mondelez all said recent years of cost-cutting are paying off in increased profits but decreased sales. Even at that meeting, Tyson happily bucked the trend, predicting both sales and profits would turn higher this year.

 The food processing industry tends to track the U.S. economy and therefore continues to grow at a steady pace,  says Casey Garten, managing director of food and agribusiness at Bank of the West Commercial Banking Group.  The industry is well capitalized with interest rates at historic lows, which provides opportunities for growth to meet growing demand. 

There are three big gainers on the table, all the result of full-year effects of major acquisitions. As previously stated, Tyson added $4 billion in sales largely because of its late-2014 purchase of Hillshire Brands. J.M. Smucker (whose 2016 fiscal year ended this April 30) grew 37 percent and moved from No. 23 last year to No. 17 this year thanks to the early-2015 acquisition of Big Heart Pet Brands   the former Del Monte unit that includes Gravy Train and Meow Mix   and its $2.3 billion in sales.","F&B"

"Beverage market prepares for labeling changes","It s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89511-beverage-market-prepares-for-labeling-changes","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 -0400","NA","Beverage market prepares for labeling changesIt s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration released the new Nutrition Facts label. Among the changes include bolder and larger type for calories, serving size as well as changes to nutrients required. However, the biggest impacts will be an update to the serving sizes to reflect the amount that consumers typically will consume as well as including an Added Sugar section under the Total Sugars section.

Many beverage-makers already have updated their serving sizes, but the added sugars will be a new component. Brand owners will have until July 26, 2018, to comply with the requirements, while beverage manufacturers with less than $10 million a year in sales will have an additional year.

However, this isn t the only labeling change likely to impact beverage-makers. In July, the U.S. Senate and House passed national GMO-labeling legislation. As of press time, President Barack Obama had not signed this legislation into law.

According to an Associated Press article, the law will require most food and beverage packages to carry a text label, a symbol or an electronic code readable by smartphone that indicates whether the product contains GMOs. The Department of Agriculture will have two years to write the new rules based on this legislation, the article added.

But just like the proactive nature of the beverage market, brand owners already are embracing change. The Beer Institute announced a new initiative to encourage its member companies to display specific consumer information on their products, packaging or websites.

The Brewers  Voluntary Disclosure Initiative states beer companies will voluntarily include a serving facts statement on products, disclose ingredients on either the labels or secondary packaging via a list of ingredients, and provide a reference to a website with the information or a QR code, the association says.

Among the companies agreeing to this standard are Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, Heineken USA, Constellation Brands Beer Division, North American Breweries and Craft Brew Alliance.","F&B"

 With sales and net income up double-digits, our first quarter results are setting the stage for fiscal 2017,  said Rob Sands, president and chief executive officer, in a statement.  We re off to a great start due to our ability to effectively integrate and grow our recently acquired brands, increase margin across the portfolio and drive consumer demand through our best-in-class marketing and sales execution efforts for our core, higher margin premium brands. We also completed a significant expansion milestone at our Nava brewery, bringing out total current capacity to 20 million hectoliters. 

For the quarter, the company generated a consolidated net sales growth of 15 percent. Net sales for beer increased 19 percent, the company says.

 We successfully kicked off our 120 Day of Summer selling season by posting depletion growth of almost 10 percent,  Sands said.  At retail, Constellation was the No. 1 gainer in the high-end segment of the U.S. beer market. 

Wine and spirits net sales increased 8 percent, which primarily reflects the benefits of the acquisition of Meiomi and organic net sales growth on an organic constant currency basis of 3 percent driven by volume growth and favorable mix, it says. The U.S. wine business gained IRI dollar share and achieved strong earnings growth and margin expansion driven by high-end wine acquisitions and the brand s collection of  Focus Brands,  it adds.

Consolidated reported and comparable basis operating income increased 29 percent and 21 percent respectively, the company says. Beer operating income increased 22 percent, primarily due to organic volume growth, favorable pricing and the Ballast Point acquisition.

Acquiring an operating winery with a 25,000 case permit, 10 acres of vineyard and a public tasting room feels like a miracle. The location on West Dry Creek Road, just off of Westside Road, is two minutes from downtown Healdsburg and will allow us to connect with our customers in way we never could before. 

The winery sits on 20 acres with 10 acres of planted vineyards. Flanagan will replant the vineyard to Cabernet Sauvignon with modern spacing to make the most of the hillside site, it says. The winery also plans to make a significant capital investment in the facility, grounds and public tasting room, it adds. Flanagan will focus on Pinot Noir and Chardonnay from the Sonoma Coast and Russian River Valley AVA s, and will continue to produce its Bennett Valley Syrah and ultra-premium Sonoma County Cabernet Sauvignon.

Winemaker Cabell Coursey adds:  I m excited to replant the winery s estate vineyards, and look forward to redesigning the winery and creating a world-class facility. The new winery will enhance our ability to craft wines with integrity from some of the most exceptional vineyard sites in Sonoma County. ","F&B"

 In what continues to be an incredibly volatile global macro environment, we are pleased with our results for the second quarter,  Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Indra Nooyi said in a statement.  While reported net revenue performance was negatively impacted by foreign exchanges translation and the deconsolidation of our Venezuelan operations, we delivered balanced volume growth and positive price/mix driven by relentless execution of our commercial agenda and leading to solid organic revenue growth. At the same time, our focus on driving greater efficiency throughout or operations contributed significantly to attractive margin expansion while we continued to invest in our business. Based on our year-to-date performance, we are raising our full-year core constant currency EPS growth objective. 

According to the company, net revenue declined 3.3 percent, due to a negative 4 percent impact by foreign exchange translation and a minus 2.5 percent impact from the Venezuela deconsolidation. Organic revenue, excluding these factors, increased 3.3 percent, the company says.

Reported operating profit increased 2 percent, while core constant currency operating profit increased 4 percent, the company says.

PepsiCo s North America Beverages (NAB) was positively impacted during the quarter by productivity gains, lower raw-material costs, favorable settlements of promotional spending accruals and insurance adjustments, partially offset by operating cost inflation, it adds.

The company reports that net revenue has declined 3.1 percent, while organic revenue grew 3.4 percent year-to-date. Additionally, reported operating profit declined 2 percent and core constant currency operating profit increased 7 percent, it says.","F&B"

Not only was Times Square considerably cleaner, but what stood out, literally, were the towering digital billboards that flashed advertising, promos for upcoming TV shows, events and movies and more.

From the top of a double-decker bus, unconventional advertisements of several beverage brands also resonated. For example, a huge red-and-white Budweiser ad was plastered on the side of a building. With the five-ringed Olympic logo in place, the graphically interesting, sports- themed ad featured male and female athletes playing soccer, throwing a javelin, running and preparing to hit the water.

Another billboard featured the 5-calorie goodness of Bai, proclaiming its  High Fashion Flavor and Thrift Store Calories.  Bai also made news last month as it was the only beverage recognized by New York-based Nielsen as a 2016 U.S. Nielsen Breakthrough Innovation Award winner. In a statement, Nielsen said it reviewed nearly 3,500 consumer products that were introduced in the consumer packaged goods market in 2014, recognizing 18 that help to improve daily routines, it said. It also noted that it was the first time two start-up companies, one being Bai, were recognized.

Many other brands, like the sports drink beverage BODYARMOR, ramp up interest in their products using traditional marketing such as social media, field and event marketing or by simply having consumers try their products. These tactics seem to be working for BODYARMOR, which is experiencing triple-digit growth. For more information, see the cover story.

Regardless of the ways today s beverage brands are marketing themselves, it s likely that they will continue to use both conventional and high-tech ways to get noticed.","F&B"
"Beverage packaging trends impact labeling equipment","An increasing number of SKUs, changing packaging formats and sizes, and a growing interest in personalization are driving a constant need for faster production. Labeling equipment is one area that has felt the pressure from these trends, and the industry continues to innovate to provide beverage manufacturers with the fastest, most flexible machinery, experts say.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89522-beverage-packaging-trends-impact-labeling-equipment","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 08:48:00 -0400","NA","Beverage packaging trends impact labeling equipmentAn increasing number of SKUs, changing packaging formats and sizes, and a growing interest in personalization are driving a constant need for faster production. Labeling equipment is one area that has felt the pressure from these trends, and the industry continues to innovate to provide beverage manufacturers with the fastest, most flexible machinery, experts say.

Recently, beverage brands are embracing the idea of personalization on packaging. For example, in May, Atlanta-based The Coca-Cola Co. expanded on its Share a Coke campaign, which featured labels with common names, with its Share a Song campaign, which includes Coca-Cola labels featuring song lyrics. Additionally, the company s Diet Coke brand launched the It s Mine campaign, featuring 12-ounce contour glass bottles with full-body shrink-sleeve labels decorated in myriad designs.

Plano, Texas-based Dr Pepper Snapple Group has embraced personalization as well when its Dr Pepper brand launched the Pick Your Pepper campaign this summer. The Pick Your Pepper custom-label bottles leverage unique digital technology in which text, graphics and images can be changed from one printed piece to the next in mass quantity, the company says.

As these types of campaigns continue to prove effective and grow in popularity, labeling equipment has had to accommodate.  Recent trends indicate that it is no longer enough for producers to simply deliver a quality product in a package with a label; consumers today prefer beverages that reflect their individual needs and preferences,  says Michele Morrone, a member of Norcross, Ga.-based Sidel s Labelling Product Management Team.  That is because key contributors to success over the past year or so have been personalization and products that match the consumer s lifestyle. Understanding how to build end-user engagement, producers today need to be fast, flexible and willing to challenge convention. 

He adds:  The popularity of beverage label personalization is increasing significantly, with smaller batch sizes and tighter timing being natural consequences of this trend. This means a challenge for the labeling process in terms of flexibility as customized labels must be designed and produced quickly. 

Bill Hernandez, sales director for packaging at Karlville, Miami, notes that digital printing has been one major trend impacting beverage labels; however, it does not impact the labeling machinery.  The digital print technology has majorly impacted the flexible packaging machinery, but not as much the labeling equipment,  he explains.  For the change to shrink-sleeve application machinery to work smoothly on this kind of printing, it is recommended to use reverse-printing on the label in order to create less friction when the label is sliding through the mandrel.

 The benefits of the digital printing are less time obtaining the material, less scrap ratio, and the possibility for brands to personalize the label faster and use less amounts of material,  Hernandez continues.  Other types of printing in the shrink-sleeve industry usually are offset, flexo [and] gravure. 

Sidel s Morrone notes that the market for shrink-sleeve labeling (SSL) is growing.  SSL offers the potential to reinforce branding and to create eye-catching designs to appeal to the consumer and make the product stand out from the competition,  he explains.  It can combine great flexibility and labeling quality and, in addition, presents the possibility of using all film material types.   The label sleeve can also serve effectively as a seal and, in the case of sensitive beverages, it can be used as a light-barrier. 

Because the sleeve is heat-shrunk, it eliminates container shape restrictions, and removes glue and solvents, making it easier for the PET raw material to be recycled, he adds.

Although SSL is growing in popularity, roll-fed, self-adhesive and pressure-sensitive labeling methods also are common and effective, according to Morrone.

Customization is a trend that shows no signs of slowing down, he adds.  Inventing ways in which the consumer experience can be made more personal is a current tend within packaging, which is set to continue,  Morrone explains.  The introduction of  iprinting,  which allows printing directly onto the bottle, is adding even greater possibilities for personalization. 

Unique, customized packaging shapes and sizes also are impacting labeling equipment, says Justin Slarks, director of marketing for Sleeve Seal, Little Rock, Ark.  Sleeve Seal has been busy keeping up with the needs of manufacturers that are labeling unique bottles and shapes at speed,  he says.  We have machines running at 720-plus [bottles per minute] (BPM) on bottles that require orientation and have tight tolerances on label placement. The trend seems to be stylized packaging that creates a unique look on the store shelves. 

However they re applied, labels have become more important than ever, Morrone says.  [A] label can attract the consumer s attention and encourage them to select one beverage over another,  he says.  So, it s even more important for a brand to stand out on the supermarket shelf. Today s manufacturer, therefore, needs to be able to adapt and change quickly in order to react to market conditions. So, more than ever before, real flexibility within its labeling solutions is really important for any beverage producer. 

Yet, similar to many other aspects within beverage operations, a desire for higher production rates and flexibility is not new. As SKUs continue to proliferate, there s a higher necessity to increase production time in order to quickly and efficiently accommodate product changeover.

 We see a trend toward increased machine uptime and efficiency requirements as being paramount to our customers,  says Neal Konstantin, president of PDC International, Norwalk, Conn.  Flexibility is only second to efficiency. Machines need wide capability ranges and quick, tool-less changeovers from one format to the next. 

He notes that a beverage manufacturer should look for equipment with robust design, which can allow for 24/7 uptime and reliable operation.

PDC International recently launched two new pieces of labeling equipment. Its Conform Series 140F Steam Tunnel has five individually adjustable steam zones, which offer greater shrink quality and consistency while labeling 300 containers a minute, the company says. The PDC R-350 Evolution Shrink Sleeve labeler is a multi-use shrink-sleeve labeler that processes as many as 400 difficult-to-label containers a minute, it says. The system features a tool-less changeover feature and is ideal for thin films, it adds.

Sleeve Seal s Slarks also notes the importance that changeover flexibility has to co-packaging companies.  Flexibility is extremely important,  he says.  Co-packers want robust machines that allow for format changes at affordable prices. Machines that allow simple changeover without retraining operators are invaluable. 

According to Slarks, the company offers durable, highly efficient machines that can precisely label using affordable change parts.  Our user interface is user-friendly, and we offer on-board reference libraries and tutorials,  he says.

Changeovers are one aspect of the operation in which experts note flexibility is most essential.  It is highly important when it comes to changeovers [that] the operator can change in the least amount of time from one product production to another with different specifications,  Karlville s Hernandez explains.  As machinery providers, we need to make sure the changeovers are friendly enough for our customers, like [when] changing a production from a 6-ounce bottle to a 32-ounce bottle in less than 20 minutes. This change in production includes changing recipient, label, [the] type of label application, machine parts and tunnel heat set-up, among other changes. In order for these changeovers to be [done] in the least amount of time, the company should have specific set-up sheets and proper training.

 The automation definitively is important for efficiencies in the complete product line,  he continues.  In labeling machinery, in order to support the productivity of the labeling line, we work [on] implementing automation as much as possible [with] regards to changeovers. Not only changeovers made from size-to-size of the containers, but also changeovers from roll-to-roll. 

Karlville offers many labeling equipment solutions, Hernandez says.  In our environment inside Karlville, for the shrink-sleeve lines we are building and supplying machines that run up to 800 [containers] per minute,  he says.  We offer standard tunnels and dry steam tunnels, which is new technology, together with the Tornado and other tunnels. We also keep up with technology on thinner materials [of] up to 25-macron with materials PVC, PET and OPS. 

Sleeve Seal s Slarks also notes the effects that the proliferation and innovation in automation has had on labeling equipment.  As automation reaches new speeds, the labeling machines need to keep up with the other machines in the line. Line speeds are only as fast as the slowest piece of equipment, so as other machines gain speed, labelers have to keep up. 

Sidel s Morrone explains that to keep up with the pace of automation, main mechanical parts involved in labeling machines increasingly are being replaced with servo-motors.  This is a huge impact,  he says.  The management and synchronization of all the functions becomes much more sophisticated. The information control of the process parameters for setting, maintenance and trouble-shooting is much more accurate. It reduces the need for manual intervention as adjustments can be made via the human machine interface. This also reduces maintenance and lubrication requirements. 

According to Morrone, Sidel offers solutions for many different types of labels, including shrink-sleeves, roll-fed, pressure sensitive or pre-cut.

Looking ahead, experts agree that thinner labeling materials are in store.  The speeds of other related equipment seemed to have plateaued, so the next step is a change in materials,  Slarks says.  Plus, thinner materials offer fewer changeovers, more cost-effective shipping and lower costs per impression. 

Karlville s Hernandez echoes similar sentiments.  The future for the shrink-sleeve equipment is to continue improving the application of thinner materials to lower the cost of the label, to continue to make the machinery smaller and more compact and to continue improving speeds,  he says.","F&B"

Tea consumption in the U.S. has been rising steadily, driven in no small part by consumers  embrace of the iced version as their year-round beverage of choice. In fact, the Tea Association of the USA reports that a whopping 85% of tea consumed in America is served over ice. At the same time, the association indicates that the hot tea category has also been on the upswing. While this overall growth largely reflects the perception of tea as a healthful beverage alternative, its increasing use in foodservice as an ingredient owes more to its versatility both in the kitchen and at the bar.

Earl Grey is making headway on menus. The tea derives its distinctive flavor from the oil of the bergamot orange, which lends subtle character to a range of dishes. At Alden & Harlow in Cambridge, Mass., for example, it has been used to cure crispy Berkshire pork belly served with cold-smoked grits. The tea s citrusy notes also account for its appearance on dessert menus. Foundation Social Eatery in suburban Atlanta has featured Earl Grey-scented chocolate mousse, and Semilla in Brooklyn, N.Y., has offered rhubarb with Earl Grey ice cream as the final course of its tasting menu.

The tea truly shines in cocktails. At Thirteen Pies in Fort Worth, Texas, the house special Blues & English Grey mixes Earl Grey vodka with elderflower, lemon and blueberry. The Third Man in New York City followed a similar path with its Myrtle Grey that combined myrtle berry liqueur with Earl Grey-infused gin. San Francisco s Presidio Social Club changes things up with Drunken Earl, a signature hot quaff that combines rye with Drambuie and Earl Grey tea.

Other tea varieties offer unique flavor profiles. This presents an opportunity that Chicago chefs are busily exploiting, as the city seems awash in tea-accented food and beverage innovation. Imperial Lamian, which touts its modern Chinese cuisine and artisanal cocktails, delivers on that promise with Jasmine Tea Smoked Ribs on the food menu and Dynasty Tea Time with chamomile vodka and lemon sour on the beverage list. Chamomile also pops up on the American-Mediterranean menu at nearby Ada Street, where the buttermilk panna cotta is finished with chamomile caramel. Waffles Cafe creates green tea waffles from matcha green tea powder topped with lemon-ginger cream and ground pistachio; those flavors are reworked in the green gea Wonut, the operation s popular signature waffle-doughnut hybrid. Michelin-starred Sixteen focuses on local ingredients, and its current four-course menu concludes with a seasonal elderflower/raspberry/black tea dessert.

Argo Tea, a 40-unit chain headquartered in Chicago, has really gone to town on tea-based beverages. The permanent menu includes Teappuccinos like Earl Grey Vanilla Cr me, bubble teas like Black Tea Coconut with gluten-free coconut pearls and take-offs on classic cocktails like MojiTea, Jasmine TeaMosa and Hibiscus Tea Sangria. The operation has also jumped on the cold-brew bandwagon sweeping the coffee segment with its recent introduction of Cold Brewed Single Estate Teas, and it even addresses the smoothie trend with Pom Berry SmooTea.

Sweet tea is a popular brine. Our national love affair with iced tea has deep roots in the South, where the regional favorite is invariably served sweet and consumed from morning to night, regardless of the season. Southern chefs take advantage of this deep connection on their menus, as with items such as the sweet tea pork chop at Nashville s Pinewood Social that is served with avocado pur e and salsa verde. The southern fried chicken at Mystic Grill in Covington, Ga., is sweet-tea brined and plated with buttermilk mash and andouille red-eye gravy. By contrast, Paul Bunyan s sweet tea brined chicken at Denver-based Punch Bowl Social consists of roasted free-range chicken served with a salad made with kale, tangerine, tarragon and candied walnuts.

Chains are less likely to use tea in cooking. Many have been busy spiffing up their beverage bills of fare, though, as with TGI Fridays, which menus freshly brewed specialties like strawberry passion fruit tea made with black tea, strawberries, organic agave and lime juice. And the Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf innovates with hot-weather thirst quenchers like Mucho Mango Fru-Tea and Iced Tea Latte with choice of chocolate or vanilla flavorings.

The South Bend, Ind.-based casual-dining operator had put up 26 billboards with a message reading:  The Best Mexican Food This Side of the Wall.  The text referred to presidential candidate Donald Trump s controversial proposal to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.

 We are going to replace them,  said Jeff Leslie, executive vice president and chief marketing officer for the 13-unit chain, in an interview Thursday.  We didn t anticipate the negative pushback. 

Several Hispanic groups said the billboards were offensive because of the link to the contentious wall proposal.

 There's a difference between funny and being offensive,  Sam Centallas, executive director of La Casa de Amistad Hispanic community center in South Bend, told WSBT television.

 I think they really need to think about how can you just be a little more fun without having to be degrading of demeaning,  Centallas said, adding that foodservice has a high proportion of employees with Latino backgrounds.

Leslie said the billboards would be replaced Friday and Monday with a simple black and white board that says:  Serving the Community Since 1978. 

Leslie said he heard from customers in Northern Illinois who  see the wall as an embodiment of all the anger and evil and discrimination that they feel from the Trump campaign. 

 It s like a lightning rod,  he added.  We were looking at it as a current reference point in the media. We didn t realize how much emotion is affixed to words and idea of  The Wall.  We missed that. 

Leslie said that Hacienda realized that the advertising wasn t doing what it intended. But Hacienda did receive overwhelming support for  The Wall  campaign, Leslie added.

 Messages are nine to one for the billboards, but that s a very passionate one,  he conceded.  We are in the business to do business, so we have to listen to them. 

Hacienda installed the billboards two weeks ago, Leslie said, and the replacement messages should be finished by Monday. The simple Hacienda logo and message are uncharacteristic for the brand, he said.

The brand encountered criticism in 2006 when it featured billboards depicting a small, sombrero-wearing man with the tagline of ""Take Home a Little Mexican.""

 The experience we offer the guests is a fun one,  Leslie said.  And we think the advertising should reflect that.

"Energy-efficient kitchen choices boost bottom line"," Smart operators tweak kitchens and operations to reduce utilities costs. 


  read more  ","http://nrn.com/equipped-kitchen/energy-efficient-kitchen-choices-boost-bottom-line","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 14:30:00 +0000","The Equipped Kitchen","Energy-efficient kitchen choices boost bottom line One third to one half of the electricity used at a restaurant goes to food prep,  says Richard Young, lead engineer and director of education at the Pacific Gas & Electric Food Service Technology Center in San Ramon, Calif.  In fact, a single cooking appliance over its lifespan can rack up utility bills equivalent to the cost of an entire house. 

 You only make money on energy used directly for food production,  Young points out.  Every dollar you can save on utilities will go directly to your bottom line. 

Smart operators can tweak their kitchens and operations to reduce utilities costs. On/off schedules, cook line analysis, high efficiency cooking technology and life cycle calculators are four painless ways to cut utility costs and enhance your bottom line.

The first thing many operators do when they arrive at their restaurant in the morning is to turn on ovens, grills, fryers and hoods. But unless they ll be serving customers right away, this common practice is taking money from your bottom line.

 In fact, most pieces of equipment need only 15 minutes to be ready for service,  Young says.

Young describes three steps to take control of your appliances and save money. First, create a start up and shut down time table for each piece of primary equipment. Then, go back and finesse the schedule.  For example, if you have double-stacked ovens, can you turn one off during slow times?  Young asks.

Second, create a start up/shut down time table for secondary or support appliances   conveyor toasters, hood or, dish room equipment such as pulpers and disposal sinks.

And third, walk through the kitchen and identify all the plugged in items, including heat lamps, coffee warmers, toasters, plate warmers, etc. Train staff to turn them off when not needed.  When it s not obvious that the equipment is turned on, the units could well be using electricity 24-7,  Young says.

Your kitchen may have the most efficient equipment on the market, but that won t help your bottom line if it s in the wrong location.

 Watch your cook line for three hours during a meal period,  advises Paul O Keefe, vice president of National Accounts, TriMark United East in South Attleboro, Mass., whose team specializes in restaurant design.  Keep track of how many times your chef had to leave the line and why he or she left. Was it to go to the walk-in for additional supplies? To go to the dish area to get plates? Next, challenge yourself to eliminate the reasons why that employee had to leave the line. 

O Keefe tells of one customer whose chef was convinced he needed a fully stocked bun rack to get through lunch rush, yet kept running out of burger patties and toppings because there was no space for a refrigerator. A closer look at product actually used revealed that buns were being overstocked. At that point,  the lightbulb went off,  O Keefe says.  We replaced the full-sized bun rack with a worktop refrigerator, and added two over-shelves to store the buns. The change saved the chef eight to 12 re-supply trips to the walk-in, 100 feet away, in the middle of rush periods. 

Newer technology such as induction burners and high wattage microwave ovens can speed service times without placing a hit on utility bills.  How many times have you wished that two burners of your six burner stove were on the other side of the line? Induction ranges can fix that problem,  O Keefe says.

Countertop and drop-in induction equipment in the form of conventional ranges, stockpot ranges, single hobs, and even woks or planchas, offers controlled heating without adding to your kitchen s HVAC load. Bonus point: Induction cookers can be used in non-traditional areas and usually do not need to be vented.

Microwaves are another evolving equipment category to check into for speedy, energy-efficient cookery.  Microwave hybrid technology   whether that s a  steam microwave  or a  speed  cooker   gives you options that are less expensive than a full  speed oven, yet more versatile and powerful than traditional microwaves,  O Keefe says. Look into models made by Amana/ACP Bakers Pride, Panasonic, Alto-Shaam and Waring, to name a few.

 High efficiency units are better at moving the energy you purchase into the food you re selling,  Young points out. Precise controls, better insulation and improved heat exchangers and burners all play a role in making one model of equipment more energy smart than another. When it comes time to add equipment to your kitchen, life cycle calculators can help you choose between the griddle and the broiler, or the combi oven vs. the rotisserie oven.

Life cycle calculators, available online at the Food Service Technology Center website (www.fishnick.com), ask you to input such data as the make and model, energy costs, operating hours, location and other parameters in order to generate an estimate of the cost to operate the unit over its lifespan.

 Take steamers, for example,  Young says.  Even a small three-pan steamer will send 40 gallons/hour down the drain and cost about $3,000 per year in energy, water and sewer fees. By contrast, a closed-loop steamer recirculates steam instead of sending it down the drain, and costs $500 per year to operate. 

Whichever energy efficiency solutions provide the best operational and economic fit for your particular foodservice operation, it is smart to keep in mind that any savings you are able to introduce will go straight to your bottom line.","Restaurants and Food Services"
"Falling sales could make leases troublesome"," Blog: Heavy demand for leased sites has driven up costs, and contributed to higher prices. 

  read more  ","http://nrn.com/blog/falling-sales-could-make-leases-troublesome","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 21:06:00 +0000","Sales Trends","Falling sales could make leases troublesomeThis post is part of the On the Margin blog.

We recently asked Jeff Garrett why sales are up at his soon-to-be-10-unit California-based family- dining chain Lumberjacks. One of his explanations surprised us a bit: Patience.

Specifically, his concept waits out until sites open up at rates that are reasonable enough to make a profit even in a downturn.

 In California, it s hard to find a spot,  Garrett said.  Everyone wants $3 to $3.50 per square foot. You can t go into that spot and remodel and pay rent with the minimum wage going up.

 A lot of these restaurants over the next five years are going out of business. 

In March, we wrote about rising lease costs amid intense demand from rapidly growing fast-casual chains and others looking at similar locations. We noted that demands for high rents could cause serious profitability problems if sales fall.

Since then, almost on cue, same-store sales have slowed. Publicly traded chains on average reported same-store sales in the spring that were 170 basis points slower than the previous quarter. The biggest slowdown has come at fast-casual chains where lease costs are especially high given heavy demand for the spaces those restaurants occupy.

According to Black Box Intelligence, only a third of fast-casual chains reported a same-store sales increase in the second quarter. And this is with one of the biggest concepts in that space, Chipotle Mexican Grill, was down well over 20 percent.

Same-store sales continue to slow down. According to MillerPulse, same-store sales have fallen for three straight months since at least 2010. Traffic is down 2.8 percent across the board. That s a major loss of customers.

High lease costs could be contributing to this issue. There is a widening gap in menu price inflation between restaurants and grocers, and many of us believe the lower prices are providing those grocers with an advantage.

Operators are raising prices in part out of fear of rising labor costs. But those operators also have these leases to worry about. And so they push prices higher in the name of maintaining margins.

There s little indication that sales are reversing. If the industry is truly into a recession, as people like Stifel Analyst Paul Westra believe, then a longish period of sales weakness could cause serious problems for some concepts that have a lot of locations with high lease rates.

That s not the only liability, either. Many franchisees in particular have borrowed tens of millions of dollars to acquire locations and remodel old locations. That debt level could be pushing operators to raise prices even amid declining food costs to meet cash flow covenants.

That debt, too, could look awfully expensive as sales continue to fall.

The decline continued a steady erosion since January 2015 that has worsened in 2016. July marked the third straight monthly decline, the first time that has happened in the post-recession era.

It was also the worst performance since 2010 for the index, excluding February 2013, when the index was compared with a Leap Year month from the year before, said Larry Miller, the survey s co-founder.

 It just got worse again,  Miller said.  There s nothing that says things are stabilizing. 

The index declined because of poor traffic, which fell 2.8 percent for the industry as a whole.

And the index was weak across the board. Same-store sales fell for both quick-service restaurants (0.2 percent) and casual dining (1 percent).

Traffic fell 2.6 percent at quick-service restaurants, and declined 3.1 percent at casual-dining restaurants. Both figures were the worst traffic numbers since MillerPulse began breaking out the two segments in 2012.

 That s just not going to turn,  Miller said.  You have the Olympics going on right now, something that doesn t encourage people to go out of the house. And you have elections, which have divided the country as it normally does. It hurts confidence in the short term until people coalesce around the winning party. 

The dramatic slowdown in industry sales has shocked many observers, given that much of the economy appears to be on solid footing. Gas prices remain low. Unemployment is falling. Wages are rising. Overall inflation appears to be in check. The signs are strong enough that the Federal Reserve is considering raising interest rates.

Yet consumers are clearly acting differently this year. Look at retailers: Several brick-and-mortar retail companies have reported disappointing earnings recently. Same-store sales at Minneapolis-based Target Corp. fell 1.1 percent in the second quarter ended July 30, the company said Wednesday.

 When you look at all the retailers, they re not reporting solid numbers,  Miller said.  The consumer is just pulling back, broadly. 

In recent earnings calls, restaurant executives have speculated numerous reasons for the slowdown. Many appear to believe consumers are pulling back broadly and not spending as much as they once did.

Grocery spending might also have something to do with it. Retail food prices decreased 1.6 percent in July, while restaurant menu prices have increased 0.2 percent, according to federal data.

Another potential explanation: The rising number of independent and small chain restaurants not captured by indexes like MillerPulse might be getting more sales.

 Clearly, there is some market share shifting, to grocery and/or independents,  Miller said.  There s a lot of growth out there in units. 

Technology might have something to do with that.

Online ratings through services like OpenTable and Yelp, and on Google, have taken some of the risk out of eating at an independent restaurant. More consumers, looking for different experiences, might be shifting spending in a bid to try something new   much like customers of Target are shifting spending to online retailers like Amazon.

 There s a lot of information about independents on your phone,  Miller said.  Darden [Restaurants] used to say that.  We re trusted. We have a high level of trust with consumers about what they re going to get. 

 Maybe that was the case five to 10 years ago, when people didn t have great information. 

And, he added,  Chains have always had a bad stigma.

 Casual-dining operator looks to double size of portfolio by 2017 


  read more  ","http://nrn.com/mergers-acquisitions/real-mex-shops-new-brand","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 19:48:00 +0000","Casual Dining","Real Mex shops for new brandFour years after emerging from bankruptcy, Real Mex Restaurants Inc. is looking for a strategic acquisition with the goal of doubling its portfolio by 2017.

The casual-dining operator has hired Telsey Advisory Group LLC to act as financial advisor in adding a new growth brand to Real Mex, said Bryan Lockwood, CEO of Cypress, Calif.-based Real Mex, on Tuesday. Real Mex is parent to the Acapulco Mexican Restaurants, El Torito Restaurants and Chevys Fresh Mex brands, as well as the four-unit El Torito Grill and one-off concepts Las Brisas, Sinigual, El Paso Cantina, and Who Song and Larry s Cal-Mex Cantina.

Real Mex operates a total of 102 units across those brands, and franchises another 13 Chevys restaurants.

The goal is to leverage Real Mex s infrastructure to grow a new brand, which may not necessarily be a Mexican concept, Lockwood said. It could even be a multi-brand operator.

The target is a company with annual sales between $100 million and $300 million; a concept that appeals to Millennial and Gen Z consumers with global expansion potential; and something in casual dining, fine dining or fast casual.

Lockwood said the company is not interested in a quick-service brand.

 We would virtually be interested in anything except QSR,  he said.  The headwinds will be extraordinary in coming years, so we re not a fan of that space. 

Real Mex is also not looking for a franchise brand, he noted.

 We feel like we have work to do before franchising other brands,  he said.  We need to marinate together a little longer before we ask other people to get involved in what we re doing. 

Real Mex has been setting up a turnaround for the company s core brands since Lockwood was named CEO in March 2015. He said the company s turnaround is well underway.

Despite challenges for the casual-dining segment overall, Real Mex has recorded 12 months of positive same-store sales year over year, Lockwood said, although he declined to give specifics.

Real Mex has revamped or refreshed 22 restaurants, and this month is scheduled to open its first new unit since 2007: a Chevys in Northridge, Calif., that will serve as a new prototype design.

An overhaul of the Acapulco brand debuted with a redesigned restaurant in Downey, Calif., earlier this month. Real Mex has also reworked the menu at the El Torito restaurant near company headquarters.

When Lockwood, the former CEO of Tavistock Restaurants LLC, was hired last year, he was the third CEO of Real Mex in four years.

Real Mex emerged from bankruptcy in 2012 with new private-equity owners Z Capital Partners LLC and Tennenbaum Capital Partners LLC.

Earlier this year, Z Capital acquired the two-unit Pink Taco brand, which Real Mex operates under a management service agreement.

Lockwood described the past decade for Real Mex as  tumultuous,  but said the company has stabilized the business and earned the confidence and capital support of its private-equity owners.

Lockwood said Real Mex was once a casual-dining innovator, pioneering features like the frozen margarita and tableside guacamole. But the company  just quit evolving,  he said.

After being hit hard by the recession, it took Real Mex a decade to figure out how to return to relevance, Lockwood said.

About 10 restaurants have closed since Lockwood was hired, mostly because leases ended and the locations no longer seemed viable, he said.

Now the company is focusing on food and putting customers first.

A new culinary team has reworked the menus at each of the core brands to better differentiate the concepts, Lockwood said.

 We quit acting like a big company,  Lockwood said.  Real Mex was this juggernaut. We should be nimble and reactive and be able to listen to our guests and our employees a lot better. 

Acapulco, for example, has moved to a more  beachy  theme, with seafood dishes, and new brunch offerings. The threefold  dumbed down  menu with lots of photos is now a one-page, back-and-front menu, like  what you d expect in a more chef-driven restaurant,  Lockwood said.

Chevys has also added brunch at two restaurants, and 43 of 50 El Torito units now serve brunch.

 Sunday sales are up 19 percent year-to-date, so Sundays have become a very important day for Real Mex,  Lockwood said.

One strength is bar sales. About 28 percent of the mix at Real Mex is from adult beverages, which is about double what is typical in the bar-and-grill sector of casual dining. Lockwood said the company is playing to that strength with the addition of more craft beers and wine, in addition to cocktails.

More work needs to be done, but Lockwood said the timing is right for an acquisition rather than grow existing brands.

 You ve seen proposed public offerings that haven t happened, or there being coolness in the M&A market and the tightening of credit,  he said.  If that doesn t exist today, it s going to exist shortly unless something else happens. And I don t know what that something else would be.

 There are those that like to grow when maybe the waters are a little troubled,  he added.  If you re at the right place at the right time, you can always create opportunity. And that s what we hope to do. 

Correction: Aug. 17, 2016 An earlier version of this story had an incorrect headline that said Real Mex was looking for a buyer. The chain is looking to acquire a new brand.

Cheryl Bachelder, CEO of the Atlanta-based chain, said the operating environment produced softer than expected sales in the second quarter and a reduced same-store sales forecast for the remainder of the fiscal year.

 The headline is we remain in a very value oriented environment, despite a reasonably good situation on gas prices and unemployment,  Bachelder said.  The customer seems less confident in the future than we d like them to be. And so value was very operative in the second quarter, and we re assuming that continues through the year. 

She said the 2,600-unit Popeyes has made adjustments to its third and fourth quarter calendars  to stay on top of that value expectation of our customers,  with an eye on a balance between value offers and new products. During the second quarter Popeyes introduced three limited-time offers (Southern Fair Chicken, Magnolia Blossom Chicken and Boneless Wings) and two one-week promotions   a $5 favorites offer and the boneless wings introduction at a $5 price.

 We do not want to move to a year-round core menu value   we don t think that s healthy for the brand in the long term,  she said,  so balance is our planning principle. 

While acknowledging a strong customer response to these offers   their contribution to the mix of sales in the quarter was the highest ever, Bachelder said   they were not driving incremental sales, which she said was a function of reduced traffic sector-wide.

Bachelder attributed the sector weakness to consumer confidence that was  stable but not robust,  as well as to a  wear-out factor  coming with the increase in value promotions. Finally, she said decreasing grocery prices were reducing eating out overall.

 I feel comfortable that our franchises are doing their best to stay competitive in their marketplace. What I'm not satisfied with this the sector trends,  she said.  I think the sector needs to improve. The consumer needs to be eating out more often in general for all of us to prosper. So, I think we're okay on pricing but I'd sure like to see more vitality in the sector on traffic.

Marcato Capital Management, which owns 5.2 percent of Buffalo Wild Wings stock, released a lengthy presentation on its ideas for Buffalo Wild Wings, along with a scathing, four-page letter that called for  the introduction of fresh talent  on the company s board and management.

The letter comes a day after what Mick McGuire, Marcato CEO, called the company s  lackluster analyst day presentation  and amid  observable discontent among shareholders and research analysts. 

 Buffalo Wild Wings must make substantial changes to its business practices if it hopes to reach its full potential both as a company and in terms of shareholder value,  McGuire wrote.

In a statement, Buffalo Wild Wings said it has reviewed the presentation, and would review McGuire s letter. The company also said it and outside advisors have spoken with the activist  numerous times  since learning of its investment.

  

  The Buffalo Wild Wings Board of Directors and management team are committed to acting in the best interests of the Company and all of its shareholders,  the company said in a statement.

Buffalo Wild Wings  stock fell nearly 16 percent this year before July, when Marcato revealed its position in the company and its stock subsequently skyrocketed. The chain s same-store sales, which had been slowing in 2015, fell into negative territory this year. Same-store sales fell 2.1 percent at company-owned locations in the second quarter ended June 26.

During the Analyst Day presentation, the company said it planned to increase the number of share buybacks, and could start paying a dividend, while borrowing more money.

But it also defended its current strategy of acquiring franchised locations and operating more company-owned units. Buffalo Wild Wings operates nearly half of the system s nearly 1,200 locations.

 We still think that a well-operated company restaurant can create significantly more profit than franchising,  James Schmidt, Buffalo Wild Wings chief operating officer, said during the analyst presentation.

 

 But Marcato says that strategy should end, and the company should sell most of its more than 500 locations to new and existing franchisees. The activist says Buffalo Wild Wings would earn a higher earnings multiple from investors if it shifted to a 90-percent franchised model. That would require selling approximately 400 company-owned locations.

The firm noted that, in general, companies with a higher percentage of franchised units are trading at higher multiples than companies with a higher percentage of company-owned units.

Marcato also took issue with Buffalo Wild Wings  continued acquisition of franchisees   and especially with the purchase of the 41-unit Alamowing Development LLC for $160 million last year. McGuire called the acquisition an  unmitigated disaster,  and called for an assessment of the purchase.

 That such an obviously misguided decision could be made under the guise of rigorous analysis underscores the weakness in the company s capital allocation processes and need to commit to a disciplined capital allocation plan,  McGuire wrote.

Marcato says that Buffalo Wild Wings should focus on  operational excellence  within its core business.

 Efforts to drive growth primarily through new unit openings and franchisee acquisitions currently take unwarranted precedence over maximizing same-store sales and restaurant-level margin opportunities at core Buffalo Wild Wings,  McGuire wrote.  Over the long-term, neither system growth nor franchisee acquisitions will be able to compensate for a decline in the profitability of the core concept. 

In the letter, McGuire noted the  cessation of emerging brands  growth plans,  saying that the company should focus solely on its core business.  Buffalo Wild Wings  continued success is not an inevitability,  he wrote.  As such, we believe the company should remain singularly focused on its largest earnings driver rather than placing wild bets, however small, on hit or miss growth drivers. 

In recent years, Buffalo Wild Wings acquired majority ownership in the fast-casual Mexican chain R Taco and invested in the fast-casual pizza chain PizzaRev. During the analyst day, the company again argued that the chains could provide growth in the future.

 We have a responsibility to our stakeholders to be forward looking,  Buffalo Wild Wings CEO Sally Smith said.  If we find a concept that has the potential to become a success story, we know how to build restaurants. We know how to build a brand. And we have franchisees that want to expand. 

McGuire called for the addition of talent to the board and management.  No current director has direct restaurant operating experience outside the CEO,  he said.

 We would also stress that any changes to the board should only be made after consultation with interested shareholders, and we would view any unilateral action to change the composition of the board as a hostile act of entrenchment,  he wrote.

That line could signal Marcato s willingness to start a proxy fight if it s not consulted on any potential new board members.

McGuire called on Buffalo Wild Wings to increase  urgency  in efforts to improve the brand.

 A review of past years  earnings reports reveals a number of company priorities that have since dragged on without meaningful progress,  notably the  bungled rollout of table-side order and pay functionality,  he wrote.  Even now, management is content to highlight the opportunity while very little tangible progress has been achieved. 

Update: Aug. 17, 2016  This story has been updated with a statement from Buffalo Wild Wings. A correction was also made to reflect the correct name of the chain's CEO; it is Sally Smith.

The sweet corn, available currently in 6-inch long cobs, are pre-cooked and vacuumed packed, offering an amazingly long shelf life when kept refrigerated as well as easy use inside restaurant kitchens.

The sweet corn variety is bi-colored (mixed yellow and white kernels) offering great visual appeal and a sweet and fresh crunchy taste.   You will not believe the taste of this corn as compared to frozen products offered today,  comments Dewight Hall, owner of Columbia Fresh.

The sweet corn, labeled Sunbites, was featured at the National Restaurant Associations annual food show in Chicago this year and is currently on the menus of, Ruben s Mexican Grill, Dyer, IN and Pepe s Off Broadway Mexican Restaurant located in Merrillville, IN.  Both are using the corn to offer  Elote , a Mexican style sweet corn blended with mayonnaise, Cotija cheese, and a blend of spices like smoked paprika and cayenne pepper.   Topped off with fresh lime juice.  It is sold as an appetizer and is a delicious treat due to the taste of the super-sweet corn taste with the saltiness of the cheese, spices and lime juice.   It really gets that sweet/salty taste popping inside your mouth , offered Rick Bella, Director of Business Development for Columbia Fresh Produce.  Everyone seems to really love the taste  he added.

This sweet corn is grown in some of the richest vegetable growing regions of North America where cool summer nights increase the sugar content of the corn.  It offers not only a consistent size, but simple and fast warming preparation times, allowing users to prepare what is needed quickly.  Warming can be done via microwave, steam, boiling, or grilling.  Since the product is pre-cooked, it only needs to be brought to serving temperature and with individually vacuum sealed ears, shrink or loss of product is almost non-existent.  No shrink, no cleaning, easy, fast preparation, are all welcomed features to restaurant operators.

The variety of uses this corn offers extends beyond a side dish or entr e complement to include appetizers and small plate menus. Columbia Fresh is excited to present this great product as an alternative in this fresh food category.  The other benefit is that it is available year-round and will always offer the same great taste.

It is currently in distribution from Testa Produce Company, Chicago, IL, and Caito Foods, Indianapolis, IN.  Columbia Fresh is seeking distributors of this new and exciting product.  Columbia also offers direct store delivery in certain areas of the country.

Andrew Collier, brother of slain MIT police officer Sean Collier who gave his life protecting his community during the Boston marathon bombing tragedy, has been lobbying Congress to designate ONE day to recognize the contribution and sacrifice of First Responders across America   a National First Responders Day.

Inspired by Andrew s determined efforts and on behalf of First Responders across America, Hooters has partnered with the National Association of Police Organizations, the National Black Police Association and Thankyoufirstresponder.org to launch FirstRespondersDay.org. ONE website where Americans can express our gratitude and share our support for First Responders and sign a petition formally requesting that Congress pass, and the President sign, legislation creating a National First Responders Day.

The drive to secure ONE million petition signatures has become a grassroots movement to make National First Responders Day a reality.  MLB Hall of Famer Hank Aaron, politician and activist Ambassador Andrew Young, ESPN football analyst Jon Gruden, and NASCAR driver Greg Biffle are among the many supporters who encourage Americans to sign the petition.  UFC President Dana White, UFC Hall of Famer Forrest Griffin and UFC Heavyweight Champion Stipe Miocic have also joined the effort. The UFC s Stipe Miocic is ONE of the millions of First Responders nationwide serving his community as a part-time firefighter and paramedic.  With this broad coalition of support, we will reach the goal of ONE million signatures and ultimately get the attention of Congress.

In addition to signing the petition, Americans can show their support for First Responders by posting a picture on social media using the hashtag #OneWordOneDay and holding a sign with ONE word that they believe best represents First Responders.  See what s been shared at FirstRespondersDay.org.

 Once we heard about Andrew Collier s efforts it took us about two seconds to decide that we would actively support the cause of establishing a National First Responders Day. It would have taken less time but we were momentarily stunned that Andrew did not find enough support for his efforts,  said Terry Marks, CEO of Hooters.  Each and every day, and at great personal risk, First Responders protect all Americans by doing the work that many of us, if we are honest with ourselves, wonder whether we would have the courage to do.  All Americans are safer because of their sacrifices, and it s beyond time to honor those sacrifices with a special day of recognition. 

Hooters is expressing its thanks to our Nation s First Responders by treating them to a free entr e.  On Tuesday September 20, all First Responders can select an item from a special menu that includes, Buffalo Chicken Salad, Buffalo Chicken Sandwich, Hooters Burger, 10-Piece Traditional Wings and 10-Piece Boneless Wings, when they present a valid ID at any Hooters location across the nation.

Hooters of America, LLC, is the franchisor and operator of more than 420 Hooters restaurants in 42 states and 26 countries. Known for its world famous Hooters Style chicken wings, the first Hooters opened its doors in 1983 in Clearwater, Florida. Expectations were so modest at the time that the simple fact the doors opened was deemed worthy of a toast. Since then millions have been liberated from the ordinary at Hooters while enjoying great food, fun and one-of-a-kind hospitality.

On Saturday, August 20th, Hwy 55 Burgers, Shakes & Fries will celebrate the people of Burlington at its newest restaurant at 1183 University Drive, Suite 110. With numerous locations already in North Carolina, the Burlington restaurant adds to the burger brand s state-wide profile.

The celebration will feature a classic car cruise-in, face painting, a bouncy house plus great giveaways throughout the day. Hwy 55 will also offer $3 burgers and a free scoop of custard (one per person).

 The Burlington community has welcomed our Hwy 55 s family-friendly concept so we wanted to dedicate a party to thank them for their support,  said Brett Klooz, Hwy 55 s Burlington operator.

In keeping with Hwy 55 s continued mission to give back to the communities it enters, the restaurant is making a $1,000 donation to the local Alamance Partnership for Children, whose mission is to support Alamance County families in creating and sustaining nurturing environments for their children.  The donation is from Andy s Charitable Foundation, Hwy 55 s most visible commitment to community involvement and the local franchise owners who donated 10% of their sales the first three days (up to $1,000).

With 126 units and growing quickly, Hwy 55 boasts a fresh, All-American diner experience with fresh, never-frozen burgers, premium sliced cheesesteaks piled high on steamed hoagies, and frozen custard made in-house every day. With its open-grill design, the kitchen s dedication and care when hand-crafting meals is front and center.

 I founded Hwy 55 Burgers, Shakes & Fries 25 years ago to provide our guests with great food, friendly service and honest value,  said Hwy 55 president Kenney Moore, who flipped every burger himself for the first two years.  Those principles continue today at all of our restaurants and I m excited that our first location in Burlington, it has already been a success in a short amount of time. We look forward to being a continued part of the community and welcoming more guests to our new spot. 

Hwy 55 has resonated with the burger-loving public, while the restaurant and franchising industries have taken notice of the growing concept as well. Hwy 55 won BurgerBusiness.com s  Best Burger  in 2012 and in 2014, Franchise Business Review named Hwy 55 one of the best restaurant franchises in the country. The brand also was recently named a top 500 franchise in the United States by Entrepreneur magazine and a  Next 20  restaurant brand by Nation s Restaurant News.

Hwy 55, a retro-themed diner that features fresh, never-frozen hand-pattied burgers, house-made frozen custard, and other classic favorites in a unique open-kitchen setting, was founded in Goldsboro, North Carolina in 1991. Hwy 55 reflects founder Kenney Moore s commitment to authentic hospitality and fresh food. Widely known in the state for its fresh food and service that exceeds expectations, the chain won BurgerBusiness.com s  Best Burger  in 2012. It also was recently named a top 500 franchise in the United States by Entrepreneur magazine and a  Next 20  restaurant brand by Nation s Restaurant News.

Wetzel s Pretzels, the innovator in the fresh-baked pretzel category, today unveiled its all-new Wetzel s Pretzels Rewards Mobile App, which allows guest to earn free pretzels, pay with their mobile phone and send virtual gift cards to friends.

Designed and built by Relevant Mobile, a trailblazer in developing customized mobile apps and mobile-centric data-capturing solutions exclusively for the restaurant industry, the new app is now available for download by Android and iOS users for all domestic Wetzel s locations.

 We like to do things a little twisted here at Wetzel s, so we wanted our Rewards app to be different than everyone else s   and thanks to the team at Relevant Mobile, we did it,  said Jennifer Schuler, Chief Marketing Officer at Wetzel s Pretzels.  Most brands in our space allow guests to earn points based on the number of visits or dollars spent, but we wanted to create a loyalty program that rewards our guests for every pretzel item they buy. That, coupled with the ability to send digital gift cards to friends, is in keeping with the unique personality of our brand. 

The Wetzel s Rewards program is unique in that it is item-based, going beyond the typical punch card or visit-based experience. Guests earn credit for every pretzel item they purchase   whether pretzels, bitz or Wetzel Dogs. Each time a pretzel item is purchased, the guest scans his or her mobile phone at the register and receives a dot on the Rewards meter. For every six pretzel items purchased, the meter is filled and a reward is earned.

The app likewise includes a Virtual Gift Card feature that allows users to select a card design, enter a recipient s name and email address along with the gift amount, and finalize payment all through the mobile application.

Guests can also use the app to pay at the register using their mobile phone, find their nearest Wetzel s location, view their Rewards activity history, refer friends, get technical support and find answers to FAQs.

 Our team really enjoyed working with the Wetzel s Pretzels brand,  Dazhi Chen, Founder at Relevant Mobile.  They have a lot of personality and they re very playful, which allowed us to have some fun creating their app. They re a really exciting addition to the Relevant family and we look forward to seeing how their guests use the new app to bond more closely with the brand.

That s why attracting new customers can sometimes feel like an uphill battle. It s your job to convince customers that your restaurant won t disappoint them. But how? Check out these ideas to find out how you can lure first time customers into your restaurant.

If you re one of four burger joints in the same neighborhood, why should customers try your restaurant over the others? What makes you stand out? You need to make sure you clearly differentiate yourself from other similar restaurants. This isn t to say you need to reinvent the wheel, but something needs to be unique. Whether it s your atmosphere, the quality of your ingredients, or your impeccable service, you need to have something to draw people in.

Post pictures of your food on Instagram, tweet about your specials, and post regularly on Facebook. And, be sure to interact with people. Staying engaged with your community and being open to communication is one way to attract new customers. Social media can have a huge reach, and it can introduce you to many new people.

Nothing brings in new customers like the recommendations of their family, friends, and coworkers. One of the best ways you can attract new diners is by keeping your current diners happy. When they brag to everyone about the awesome experience they had at your bar or restaurant, everyone who listens in will be that much more likely to check you out. Best of all? Word of mouth is totally free.

Be sure to scan your Yelp reviews (and other review sites, too). Remember, this is what potential customers will see when they look you up. If there s a lot of negative feedback, work on correcting your faults. Hopefully by fixing your problem areas, you can make your restaurant a lot more attractive to new customers. And by responding to complaints, you ll show potential customers that you care about your customer service.

Daily deal sites like Groupon and Living Social are a bit controversial. There s some debate about whether or not they work, and using them too often can devalue your brand. But if you re looking to get the word out about your restaurant and entice new customers, it might be a good idea to try out a daily deal site once.

Many customers aren t willing to take a chance with a new restaurant, but if you can offer them a deal, they might be more likely to try something new. Try using coupons that offer deals for first time customers.

Although getting new customers to walk through your doors might seem difficult, it s definitely not impossible. Try out a few of these tips and see if you can bring in more first time customers!

On Friday, September 2, at 11am, a brick-and-mortar storefront of the popular food cart will open their doors at the Springfield Tower Shopping Center (6304 Springfield Plaza.)  The first 100 guests in line will receive a free entree platter of their choice and the first 1000 guests in line will have their choice of The Halal Guys t-shirt, sunglasses or commemorative cup.

 The Halal Guys was  love at first bite  for us,  said Operating Franchisee.   We are looking forward to bringing THG gyro sandwiches, chicken-and-rice platters and famous white sauce to the NoVA community and anticipate the grand opening being a huge success. 

The fast casual concept, known for its never-ending lines and a simple menu of various Middle Eastern dishes, has already been well received in Dallas, Houston, Chicago, Northern and Southern California. They pride themselves on only using high-quality products like their chicken, which has never been frozen and is marinated and seasoned overnight, then cooked and chopped on the grill and served directly to their plate to ensure a crave worthy meal that s piping hot. The Halal Guys  mission is to ensure that every customer leaves happy, with a smile on their face and a satisfaction that brings them back again.

The Halal Guys grew from its humble beginnings as a food cart on the streets of New York City to a global icon known as the largest American halal street food concept in the world. This Manhattan-based landmark was created by three like-minded men from Egypt who came to America in search of a lucrative life. When Mohamed Abouelenein, Ahmed Elsaka and Abdelbaset Elsayed noticed that many cab drivers in New York were looking for a place to buy meals in Manhattan, they created their first food cart and quickly grew into a leading tourist and native New Yorker destination for American Halal fare. In 2013, The Halal Guys were ranked the most popular food truck reviewed on FourSquare and the third most Yelped restaurant in the United States in 2014.

For updates on the Springfield location follow them on Facebook & Instagram.

The Halal Guys aim to be different and encourage patrons across America to ditch burgers for something unique. Among being awarded the 2014 Multicultural Award at The 5th American Muslim Consumer Conference, The Halal Guys have also been recognized by TIME Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, The New York Times and The Huffington Post.

Brews

It s hard to imagine a more fitting Southern cuisine than slow-smoked barbecue.  In homage to their Georgian roots, this beloved Southern staple is also the inspiration behind Your Pie s latest creation in the brand s seasonal Craft Pie Series. This fall, the down-the-line brick oven pizza franchise is bringing the family BBQ experience to their stores with the new Pitmaster Pie. The series will be offered for a limited time at all Your Pie locations from August 17th through October 25th.



 Your Pie is all about craft, and for this launch, we re excited to continue on with our tradition of innovation, both in the flavors of specialty pizza and gelato and having the opportunity to partner with another incredible brewery,  said Drew French, founder of Your Pie.  The Southern influences of true American barbecue are a favorite taste among many Americans. We were inspired to incorporate that irresistible smoky flavor into a specialty pizza. Paired with all of the flavors that make barbecue great, it really creates the bold tastes only found in a backyard barbecue but on a pizza. 

The new Pitmaster Pizza features smoky pulled pork and fire-roasted balsamic onions topped off with house-made coleslaw, tangy BBQ sauce and a zesty ranch drizzle. Your Pie is pairing this new menu item with featured brews from Terrapin Beer Co. Founded in 2002 in Athens, Georgia, Terrapin features year-round beers like the Rye Pale Ale and Hopsecutioner IPA. Other seasonal additions to the Craft Pie Series menu include the Banana Pudding Gelato a sweet compliment to the kick of the Pitmaster Pie. Made with ripened bananas and laced with a delicate cinnamon rum ripple, the Banana Pudding Gelato is the perfect mashup of Southern classic and Italian tradition.

The Craft Pie Series has been a seasonal feature of the Your Pie menu since French opened the first fast-casual pizza concept in 2008. Since then, they ve whipped up popular creations like the Slider Pie, a pizza spin on the classic American cheeseburger; the Peach Prosciutto Pizza, which featured fresh peaches, prosciutto and a honey balsamic glaze; and the Fresh Fiesta Pie a deconstructed take on guacamole.

With the launch of the new Pitmaster Pie, Your Pie will continue to encourage every store to partner up with a local charity of their choice as part of the Ins pie ering communities efforts. To make a positive impact on local communities, a portion of craft series profits will be donated back to a local charity.

 We re excited to continue our  InsPIEring Communities  concept as a compliment to not only this event, but to many of the values central to Your Pie as a whole,  said French.  Franchisees in individual markets will each be partnering with an organization of their choice to donate pizzas and proceeds raised through any Pitmaster Pie sales. 

Visit www.yourpie.com to find the nearest Your Pie location or for franchising information.

Your Pie is the world s originator of the quick-serve, brick-oven, customized personal pizza category. A culinary entrepreneur since his teenage years, Your Pie founder Drew French combined his passion for innovative restaurant concepts with brick oven technology to create the highest quality pizza available at incredible speed. Drawing from family recipes from the island of Ischia, Your Pie uses hand-tossed dough, only fresh ingredients, homemade pizza sauces and salad dressings, and offers vegan, vegetarian and gluten-free pizzas, as well as traditional pizzas. Customers who dine at Your Pie have come to expect the best tasting pizza served with speed without sacrificing flavor. Your Pie is a state of mind and the brand stands by its motto to  express your inner pizza , investing in local communities and encouraging diners to let their culinary creativity run wild.

"What s in your (digital) wallet?","              This blog is based on the report  Mobile Payments in the U.S.  View the abstract and table of contents   here  .  
  Aug. 10 -  Take a peek at your wallet or purse and what do you see? A little cash? A driver s license? Employee ID and insurance cards? Some lint? And, of course, a nice mix of payment cards? 
 For a card issuer, it all comes down to where their card stands in your wallet: is it your primary card, the one that sits at the top of your wallet the one you grab the most when paying? For many issuers, that s the catbird seat. You don t have to be first to be a winner though, especially if you are a private label card issuer with hopes of driving sales to a specific merchant, where third place isn t just a ribbon to toss in a drawer; or even a cobrand card issuer, where second can feel downright wonderful. 
 Even if a wallet can hold seven or eight cards, some of them can become out of sight, out of mind, hidden beneath the insurance card, never to be used again. A sad day indeed for that card. Meanwhile, mini-wallets today hold just two or three cards giving users reason to bring along only those cards that make the first cut. 
 In theory, digital wallets promise a bigger wallet one that can hold all of your cards, including loyalty and gifts cards (the ones we otherwise so easily lose they never even get into that old-school leather wallet!). This is a boon for consumers, who now can actually manage and manage not to lose all of their cards using them when and where they see fit. And it means all cards get a place in the wallet, a boon for the has-beens and the forgotten. 
 But it doesn t change the battle for the top spots. And by introducing ACH debit into the mix, some digital wallets may actually give up a spot to what is essentially a check that card issuers and networks make no money on. In these cases, the war for wallet share intensifies. 
  Cause for concern  
 But despite having access to all of that virtual real estate, mobile POS payers may not be using it, according to Packaged Facts December 2015 survey results: 
  Some 48% of adult smartphone users who have used their phone to make a payment at the point of sale in the past 12 months say that they carry fewer cards than they used to carry a result of using mobile payments. 
  And the tendency to carry fewer cards to make payments is higher among Millennials, already a credit card usage trouble spot. 
   Cards are getting winnowed out . Not good, unless you re near the top of the wallet. 
 This finding opens up a world of follow-up questions, among them:  
  Instead of loading  all  of their cards, are mobile POS payers just loading the ones they really need? 
  Are they defaulting to the card originally uploaded as a part of a corresponding user account (in Apple Pay, for example, do they just use the card originally entered in iTunes)? 
 How do credit card rewards/points factor into using credit cards in digital wallets? 
 Could merchants tie rewards to ACH debit?

  Aug. 2 -  Meat snacks (jerky and other snacks such as meat sticks) have become a darling of the snacking world in the last couple of years. Between paleo dieters and CrossFitters espousing the benefits of a high protein diet, the gluten- and wheat-free tribes avoiding anything to do with breads, and the continued negative press that carbs have been receiving, meat has come galloping to the rescue for many different types of snackers. 
 However, this has also caused a shift in the style of meat snacks gaining popularity, which is away from traditional simple varieties of beef jerky and towards more complex meat snacks that make use of alternative proteins (i.e., bison, kangaroo, salmon) and unique flavors, marketing artisanal meat snacks that are worlds away from your grandfather s jerky, notes Packaged Facts in the report    Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition   . 
 So how is this shift affecting sales for different meat snack providers? Link Snacks is the largest meat snack producer in the U.S., but is also having the roughest go of it trying to stay relevant in this new snacking world. Dollar sales for the company over the past year were down 7% while volume sales were down 15%, which shows the company has tried to stave off larger losses by increasing prices. If any meat snack brand epitomizes the classic style of jerky, it is Jack Link s, and these sales results show that this is not the kind of jerky people are looking for any more. 
 Compare these results to Krave s, a brand that epitomizes the new wave of healthier-for-you meat snacks marketed directly towards Millennials and which feature unique ingredients. The company ranked among the top eight marketers of meat snacks over the past year in terms of dollar sales. Dollar sales for the company were up 71%, with volume sales up 84%. These results suggest the company is selling more of its 3.5 oz bags of jerky as well as the even larger bags it sells online, but anyway you slice it, growth of the brand has been phenomenal. Oberto Sausage has also seen really good growth in dollar sales through the introduction of its new All Natural Oberto Jerky brand. The lower unit sales growth and much lower volume sales growth suggests the company has positioned this jerky as a premium brand, with a higher price point compared to its Oh Boy! brand. 
 However, let s be clear; it is really only Link Snacks and private label meat snacks that are having a hard time growing sales in this fast-growing category. Other traditional meat snacks manufacturers are doing just fine. ConAgra Foods saw strong growth in sales of its classic Slim Jim meat sticks over the period, although it is clear that about half of that growth came through price increases. Bridgford Foods is also doing exceptionally well with its Sweet Baby Ray jerkies, which pair Bridgford Foods  jerkies with the well-known BBQ sauce brand. The company actually saw a 37% increase in unit sales over the period, higher than the dollar sales growth, but slightly lower volume sales growth, suggesting the company reduced unit sizes over the period. 
 Clearly, Link Snacks needs to get itself sorted in this new market, and the company s recent introduction of its Small Batch and Lorissa s Kitchen brands are a step in this direction. However, its doubtful Krave, Bridgford Foods, and the other marketers are going to calmly wait for the venerable jerky marketer to catch up.

 Taken together, these factors boil down to the notion that cats should not be eating from bowls. Plopping a scoop of food into a bowl is not enough! 
 In their natural environment, cats eat about 12 times a day, feasting on small prey like mice and birds that are appropriate for their stomachs, which are about the size of a table tennis ball. They also toss their prey around in a form of play that is essential to their well-being.

  July 18 -  Generally speaking, consumers express interest in new culinary experiences; however, some trepidation remains when it comes to actually  trying  different foods from other cultures. Through innovation, Asian noodle marketers can help bridge the gap between interest and trial, according to Packaged Facts in the report    Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities   . 
 As suggested by our survey results, those who eat Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. The willingness to explore new food options skews higher among those who eat Asian noodles at a restaurant. 
 Once again, this reinforces the idea that restaurants are often a point of entry in ethnic food exploration. So it s not surprising to find that Asian noodle users tend to strongly agree that they enjoy eating foreign foods at a restaurant and often try different foods from other cultures. 
 Some degree of food adventurousness is required to gain knowledge and experience, which can then prompt continued food exploration. 
  As suggested by our survey results, those who believe they possess a strong knowledge of Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. This implies that the willingness to explore new food options and culinary experiences leads to increased confidence and knowledge in other cuisines. 
 Conversely, those who claim they have no Asian noodle knowledge are also less adventurous when it comes to trying new foods/recipes or showing interest in other cultures and foreign foods. 
  To better attract those who are less willing to experiment in food and culture, providing customized options allowing guests to select familiar ingredients will likely have the best opportunity as a point of entry for these new users.  
 Consider the expanding noodle chain Wagamama, which frames its brand as presenting staple modern Asian cuisine delivering fresh, authentic menus that are updated seasonally. The company leverages authenticity while understanding menu explanation is important to help guests feel comfortable with its brand and menu. For example, Teppanyaki is a menu section that offers this explanation to help patrons to increase noodle knowledge and encourage trial:  Teppanyaki is a big plate of sizzling noodles, stir-fried by quickly turning them on a flat griddle. This means you get soft noodles and crunchy vegetables.  
  The bottom line  
 By leveraging limited-time offers, seasonal menus, and other menu strategies that play to variety and change, restaurants play a significant role in shaping society s comfort with trying the new and different when it comes to foreign/ethnic foods. 
 For packaged food marketers, noodle opportunity involves utilizing brand extension, cobranding partnerships and premiumization to gain traction and encourage consumers to explore this type of culinary innovation at home.

"Millennials: Unbanked but bankable?","              Packaged Facts is your trusted source for market research on the financial services industry. We cover topics ranging from financial services for small businesses to debit &amp; credit cards to mobile payments. See our full catalog of related reports  here .   
  June 27 -  Survey analysis performed for Packaged Facts    Underbanked and Unbanked Consumers   report suggests a clear general trend away from having checking and savings accounts at traditional banking institutions even while consumers eschewing these accounts use banks for other products and services. This trend challenges the long-standing banking model that frames checking and savings accounts as the foundation for broader, deeper customer relationships. 
 Our research suggests that these  unbanked  consumers (those we define as having neither a checking nor a savings account) include those who have been underserved or shut out of traditional banking channels for financial reasons. 
 However, a different type of  unbanked  consumer emerges: one who chooses not to have a checking or savings account at a bank because that consumer has more options, not fewer options; and one who may not even view these types of accounts as relevant in the twenty-first century. 
   Many Millennials fit this description .   
 Survey analysis suggests a shift among Millennials toward account funding methods falling outside of traditional checking and savings accounts, in particularly emerging banking models. The trend clearly bodes ill for major banking institutions that do not adapt to the evolving needs of this group, which prize internet- and mobile-driven solutions, see  checking  as antiquated and irrelevant, and are likely savvy price shoppers, and are quite comfortable with online-only financial service models. 
 But we also find that younger unbanked have not forsaken traditional banking for financial services needs that fall outside of checking and savings accounts far from it: 
  In 2008, some 20% of unbanked 18-34s had nevertheless used a bank, a credit union or a savings &amp; loan institution in the past 12 months for some other kind of product or service. 
 In 2015, the percentage of unbanked 18-34s using these financial institutions for something else had risen to 37.5%.  
  These activities could range from obtaining major loans to picking up a prepaid card, getting a money order or cashing in coins. The bottom line is that the theory that Millennials are abandoning banks may be significantly overblown: By one measure, traditional financial institutions are clearly bleeding younger checking and savings accountholders, but by another much broader measure, usage is on the rebound. 
 The question is whether that usage translates to major-ticket revenue in the form of major loans or investment vehicles, steady, incremental revenue in the form of credit cards and prepaid cards, or some other source or merely an occasional piggyback on branch convenience for minor products or services.

"Millennials get ready to bring up fur baby","              See more Packaged Facts reports focused on Millennials  here .  
  June 20 -  The Millennial generation has become a driving force in the American pet industry.  Between 2007 and 2015, Millennials were responsible for 43% of the growth in the number of pet owners in the United States.  The 43 million pet owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group now account for around one in three pet owners, according to Packaged Facts in the report   Millennials as Pet Market Consumers .  
 Millennial consumers will play an even more significant role in the pet industry over the next decade.  The accelerating aging of the American population threatens to shift the consumer landscape for the pet industry because pet ownership traditionally has declined precipitously after the age of 60.  Although aging Boomers will still account for the largest share of growth in the population of pet owners, Millennials will play an increasingly vital role in the market for pet products and services.  According to Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data, more than four in 10 (44%) Millennials don t have a pet now but hope to have one in the future.  Packaged Facts projects that the Millennial generation will be responsible for adding 2.6 million pet owners between 2015 and 2020.  
 Packaged Facts    Millennials as Pet Market Consumers   provides important insights for marketers trying to understand the mindset of 18- to 34-year-old pet owners.  For one thing, Millennial pet owners demonstrate an overwhelming urge to pamper their pets.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, they are much more likely than other pet owners to agree  I would rather spend money on pet toys and other products for my pets than on things for myself.   Millennials also are much more likely to  splurge  once in a while on an item for their pets and to enjoy purchasing products that pamper their pets.   So it is not surprising that Simmons National Consumer Study data show that both dog and cat owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are much more likely than other pet owners to buy toys and fashion accessories for their pets. 
 Millennials want pets they can pick up and carry wherever they go.  Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey data show that 18- to 34-year-olds are much more likely to prefer to have a small pet  you can take with you more places.   Thus, dog owners in the 18- to 34-year-old age group are more likely than other dog owners to have small dogs weighing less than 25 pounds and much less likely to have dogs weighing over 40 pounds. 
 Millennials are more likely to coddle their pets when they feed them.  Around 30% of Millennial dog or cat owners prepare home-cooked meals for their pets, compared to just 19% of dog owners and 10% of cat owners in the 35- and-over age group.  Millennial dog or cat owners are more likely to prepare side dishes to add interest and nutrition to pre-made pet food.  Millennials also spend more money than other pet owners on treats and chews for their dogs or cats, suggesting that they especially like to reward their pets with treats and chews. 
 Millennials also appear to be a bit more obsessive about the health and safety of their pets.  For example, Millennial dog or cat owners express an elevated concern about the possibility of feeding their pets contaminated foods.  Besides being more involved in providing home-cooked foods for their pets, they are much more likely than other pet owners to use raw pet food or pet foods with formulations geared toward enhancing the health of their pets, such as organic, natural or non-GMO. 
 Moreover, compared to their older counterparts, 18- to 34-year-old pet owners are more fixated on keeping an eye on their pets.  They are much more likely to employ a wide range of technologies to track the activities of their pets and monitor the status of their health, including webcams, smartphone or tablet apps, collars with a tracking device and motion/sound sensors. 
 In short, compared to other pet owners, Millennials are more likely to be anxious about the health and safety of their pets.  They also are more inclined to pamper, coddle and keep their pets with them whenever they can, while using technology to keep an eye on them when they are away from home.  If this sounds like pets play the role of surrogate children for many Millennials, it s because they do.  According to data compiled by Packaged Facts National Pet Owner Survey, the vast majority (71%) agree that having a pet is a good way to get ready for having a family.  Thus, for many 18- to 34-year-olds owning a pet is part of their transitioning into creating a family.  So, for many Millennials it may just be that looking out for Fido and taking care of Fifi is simply a way to get ready for bringing up baby.

"The big reversal on GMO labeling","              June 10 -  Four years ago, a referendum, California Proposition_37, Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Engineered Food, was added to the November 2012 ballot. Prop 37, as it was popularly known, asked California voters to decide if the state should institute mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods, i.e. foods containing genetically modified ingredients or organisms (GMOs). More specifically, Prop 37required labeling on raw or processed food made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways and prohibited labeling or advertising such food as ""natural."" 
 As you may remember, the referendum was defeated despite the fact that its organizers had collected nearly a million signatures, far more than was needed to get the referendum on the ballet. Supporters of Prop 37 included the state s Democratic Party and its Green Party, consumer organizations such as the Organic Consumers Fund, and many companies that offered organic and/or natural foods, such as Lundberg Family Farms, Nature s Path, Clif Bar, Amy s Kitchen, and Annie s. Collectively these and other contributors devoted $8.7 million to promote passage of the referendum. 
 The food industry opposed the labeling demand and poured millions of dollars into a ""No on 37"" campaign. By the time of the November vote, the industry had spent by close to $46 million. That included over $8 million from Monsanto, the company responsible for the majority of genetically modified seeds being used in the U.S. and around the world. DuPont, also a leader in GM seeds, threw in another $5 million and the other biotech companies making GM seeds gave a couple of million dollars each. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the food companies  trade association, also contributed $2 million and several individual food companies made significant contributions, beginning with over $2 million from PepsiCo and $1.1 million from General Mills. 
 Supporters of the referendum argued that the large sum spent on advertising to oppose Prop 37 was the reason for its failure to pass. More neutral observers suggest that an equally important factor was that the legislation was badly written and unclear. They agreed with the opponents of Prop 37 that it opened the door to a mountain of unfounded lawsuits against food companies and groceries even if there were no infractions.  
 The defeat of Prop 37 did not stop a slew of similar ballot referendums and legislative proposals taking place in other states suggesting that it was only a matter of time before one passed and became law. This was, in fact, the case. In 2014 the Vermont legislature approved a very straightforward GMO labeling law set to go into effect in July 2016. 
 The legislation was challenged in the courts by the GMA, among others, but with no success. Prompted by constituents in the food industry, the House of Representatives in July 2015 passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. The bill usurped the rights of states to enact labeling laws and was specifically targeted at Vermont s legislation. But in early 2016 the Senate version of the bill failed to get enough votes, basically killing the effort to undo the Vermont law. 
 At this point, several of the original opponents of Prop 37 decided it was time to throw in the towel. Campbell Soup, which had invested $500,000 in the ""No on 37"" campaign, was the first to announce it would add a GMO label to its products. Within a few days it was joined by Mars, which had contributed $376,650 to the campaign; Kellogg, a $790,000 contributor; and ConAgra, which had given $1,176,700 to oppose Prop 37. These companies all announced they would begin GMO labeling. 
 Del Monte, which had contributed $674,100 to fight Prop 37, took the policy reversal a step further, announcing that it had decided to move away almost entirely from the use of GMO ingredients.

     Tags:&nbsp;    GMOs    food labeling    ","http://www.packagedfacts.com/article/2016-06/big-reversal-GMO-labeling","Fri, 10 Jun 2016 14:29:35 +0000","NA","The big reversal on GMO labeling | Packaged Facts HomeJune 10 - Four years ago, a referendum, California Proposition_37, Mandatory Labeling of Genetically Engineered Food, was added to the November 2012 ballot. Prop 37, as it was popularly known, asked California voters to decide if the state should institute mandatory labeling of genetically engineered foods, i.e. foods containing genetically modified ingredients or organisms (GMOs). More specifically, Prop 37required labeling on raw or processed food made from plants or animals with genetic material changed in specified ways and prohibited labeling or advertising such food as ""natural.""

As you may remember, the referendum was defeated despite the fact that its organizers had collected nearly a million signatures, far more than was needed to get the referendum on the ballet. Supporters of Prop 37 included the state s Democratic Party and its Green Party, consumer organizations such as the Organic Consumers Fund, and many companies that offered organic and/or natural foods, such as Lundberg Family Farms, Nature s Path, Clif Bar, Amy s Kitchen, and Annie s. Collectively these and other contributors devoted $8.7 million to promote passage of the referendum.

The food industry opposed the labeling demand and poured millions of dollars into a ""No on 37"" campaign. By the time of the November vote, the industry had spent by close to $46 million. That included over $8 million from Monsanto, the company responsible for the majority of genetically modified seeds being used in the U.S. and around the world. DuPont, also a leader in GM seeds, threw in another $5 million and the other biotech companies making GM seeds gave a couple of million dollars each. The Grocery Manufacturers Association (GMA), the food companies  trade association, also contributed $2 million and several individual food companies made significant contributions, beginning with over $2 million from PepsiCo and $1.1 million from General Mills.

Supporters of the referendum argued that the large sum spent on advertising to oppose Prop 37 was the reason for its failure to pass. More neutral observers suggest that an equally important factor was that the legislation was badly written and unclear. They agreed with the opponents of Prop 37 that it opened the door to a mountain of unfounded lawsuits against food companies and groceries even if there were no infractions.

The defeat of Prop 37 did not stop a slew of similar ballot referendums and legislative proposals taking place in other states suggesting that it was only a matter of time before one passed and became law. This was, in fact, the case. In 2014 the Vermont legislature approved a very straightforward GMO labeling law set to go into effect in July 2016.

The legislation was challenged in the courts by the GMA, among others, but with no success. Prompted by constituents in the food industry, the House of Representatives in July 2015 passed the Safe and Accurate Food Labeling Act. The bill usurped the rights of states to enact labeling laws and was specifically targeted at Vermont s legislation. But in early 2016 the Senate version of the bill failed to get enough votes, basically killing the effort to undo the Vermont law.

At this point, several of the original opponents of Prop 37 decided it was time to throw in the towel. Campbell Soup, which had invested $500,000 in the ""No on 37"" campaign, was the first to announce it would add a GMO label to its products. Within a few days it was joined by Mars, which had contributed $376,650 to the campaign; Kellogg, a $790,000 contributor; and ConAgra, which had given $1,176,700 to oppose Prop 37. These companies all announced they would begin GMO labeling.

Del Monte, which had contributed $674,100 to fight Prop 37, took the policy reversal a step further, announcing that it had decided to move away almost entirely from the use of GMO ingredients. Not only will all of its vegetables, fruit cups and most tomato products be non-GMO, so, too, will the added ingredients used as sweeteners. The company indicated that more than 15 products will become non-GMO and be labeled as such.

Pointing the way for the other companies that would follow its lead, Campbell s insisted that GMOs are safe and that foods derived from crops grown using genetically modified seeds are not nutritionally different from other foods. However, the company issued a statement that read in part:  We have always believed that consumers have the right to know what s in their food.

That makes this the largest marketed drug targeted to date by an FDA-approved biosimilar. Enbrel, which is sold by Amgen ($AMGN) was the fourth largest drug by worldwide sales last year.

But the Enbrel biosimilar, known as Erelzi (etanercept-szzs) as well as a Remicade biosimilar, Inflectra (infliximab-dyyb) from Pfizer ($PFE) and Celltrion that was approved earlier this year are being held up by patent disputes. So, an approval for these blockbuster biosimilars doesn t mean they will be on the market anytime soon.

Enbrel is still a growth driver for Amgen in fact, sales were up 10% year-over-year during the second quarter due to a combination of an increased net sales price and an improved competitive position.

The drug sold about $5.1 billion in the U.S. last year. It is Amgen s top selling drug. The newly approved biosimilar version is from Novartis  Sandoz division; it s also targeting Amgen s second largest drug by sales, Neulasta. But the FDA issued a complete response letter for that biosimilar candidate last quarter.

Sandoz has already launched Zarxio, a biosimilar of Amgen's Neupogen. This was the first biosimilar approved last year in the U.S. and the only, thus far, to be marketed in the country. Neupogen sales declined by almost one-quarter during the first half of the year compared to the same period a year prior to $256 million.

The unit is aiming for one of the broadest biosimilars portfolios in the industry; it s planning three more FDA submissions for biosimilars this year and next for Amgen s Epogen (epoetin alfa), AbbVie s Humira (adalimumab) and Roche s Rituxan (rituximab).

If Sandoz is successful that could put it in line to have biosimilars for 4 out of 8 of Amgen s top selling drugs. The company is aiming   to deliver one of the broadest biosimilars portfolios in the industry,  its Global Head of Drug Development and CMO Vasant Narasimhan said on the company's most recent earnings call.

As for Amgen, it s not just relying on lawyers to defend its sales. It s pursuing its own biosimilar strategy. It recently had a positive panel for a biosimilar version of Humira but AbbVie is making its own patent case in court to defend it.

In addition, Amgen has submitted to the FDA for a biosimilar version of two major Roche products: Avastin (bevacizumab) and Herceptin (trastuzumab).","Pharmaceuticals"

The Cambridge, MA-based company is seeking a license for brigatinib, its investigational anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhibitor, to be used when patients cannot take or are resistant to Pfizer s ($PFE) marketed ALK non-small cell lung cancer drug Xalkori (crizotinib).

Ariad said in a statement that it is now seeking accelerated approval for brigatinib from the FDA after asking for its coveted priority review, which means it could be on the market around 3 to 4 months earlier than with a normal review. The U.S. regulator has already given the med its  Breakthrough  tag and allowed the rolling status.

 Many patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer eventually develop disease progression,  said Dr. Corey Langer, director of thoracic oncology in the Abramson Cancer Center of the University of Pennsylvania and a professor of hematology-oncology in Penn s Perelman School of Medicine.

 We are excited that the brigatinib NDA submission is now complete and are hopeful that brigatinib s data, including the observation of complete responses and activity in the central nervous system, will provide patients and their oncologists with a new treatment option. 

The NDA submission includes data from its Phase I/II and pivotal Phase II ALTA trials of brigatinib. In the ALTA trial, patients who suffered from disease progression on Xalkori were randomized to one of two brigatinib regimens.

With a median follow-up of 8.3 months, 54% of patients treated with 180 mg with a one-week lead-in at 90 mg achieved an investigator-assessed confirmed objective response--the trial s primary endpoint. In this arm, median progression-free survival was just over a year.

 With the completion of the brigatinib submission this week, we are excited by its potential, if approved, to offer additional hope to patients and their families,  stated Paris Panayiotopoulos, president and chief executive officer of Ariad.  We are thankful to the patients and physicians who participated in the clinical trials of brigatinib. We remain grateful to the FDA for granting brigatinib a breakthrough designation and the benefit of a rolling submission process, unique to the U.S. regulatory system. 

Ariad said it plans to submit brigatinib to the EMA in  early 2017.  Xalkori, which has several U.S. lung cancer licenses, made $488 million last year--up 11% on 2014.

The company hopes to have a better second half to 2016 after announcing back in March that it was axing about 90 staffers--25% of its total workforce--in an ongoing restructuring of the business.

The biotech said it was also reviewing its R&D portfolio and other aspects of the business. This did not however impact its work on brigatinib, which remains a primary focus. This also came after Ariad laid off around 40% of its staff in 2013 when it was forced to yank its leukemia drug off the market.","Pharmaceuticals"

But while fostamatinib, its oral spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) inhibitor, hit its primary endpoint, only 18% of the 76 patients saw a stable platelet response, compared to none on the placebo arm. Analysts had previously believed low- to mid-20s was the likely target, although 18% still reaches statistical significance.

There were also a high number of AEs, with treatment-related AEs at 77% for the med, but just 28% on the placebo arm. GI complaints were the most observed adverse event on fostamatinib.

Shares had been trading up by 50% premarket this morning before the data were released at 7am ET--but then dropped by more than 9% within minutes of the figures being posted. This then rebounded to be up by around 40% by midday. The drug could reach peak annual sales of $300 to $400 million, according to estimates.

This is the first of two double-blind studies in the FIT Phase III programs for the treatment of adult chronic/persistent immune thrombocytopenia (ITP). Results from the second study are expected in October/November 2016.

The biotech is still trying to see this as a positive however, saying in a release that if these results are reproduced it will likely go for an NDA with the FDA in the first quarter of 2017.

""These data demonstrate the potential benefit of fostamatinib for chronic ITP patients who are in need of new treatment options,"" said Raul Rodriguez, president and chief executive officer of Rigel.

""We believe that fostamatinib has significant commercial potential given that it has a unique mechanism of action that may work where other products have failed.""

""We are very encouraged by these results,"" added Anne-Marie Duliege, executive vice president and chief medical officer of Rigel.

""Consistent with the prior clinical study of fostamatinib in ITP, this FIT Phase III study demonstrated that fostamatinib provided a robust and enduring benefit for those patients who responded to the drug candidate.""","Pharmaceuticals"

Specifically, the San Diego, CA-based biotech said it has submitted the once-daily valbenazine to the FDA for tardive dyskinesia.

The company said it expects its submission to be accepted by October, giving it an expected PDUFA date in April, should it get an accelerated review--it has already received a ""breakthrough"" designation from the FDA.

Its drug is a VMAT2 inhibitor that modulates dopamine release during nerve communication. It is designed to treat tardive dyskinesia, a condition characterized by involuntary, repetitive movements of the face.

The biotech said that these symptoms are rarely reversible and there are currently no FDA-approved treatments.

Baird analyst Brian Skorney said in a note to clients that Neurocrine remained on an  outperform  rating as the NDA came a little earlier than expected.

The news gets better for Neurocrine, as partner AbbVie ($ABBV) is also on track to file their investigational endometriosis drug elagolix for its U.S. NDA next year.

 This is an important milestone in the development of valbenazine for the treatment of tardive dyskinesia, a serious disease for which there is no FDA approved pharmaceutical treatment,  said Kevin Gorman, president and CEO of Neurocrine Biosciences.

 We look forward to working with the FDA in their review of the valbenazine NDA submission to potentially bring this important treatment option to patients and physicians. 

But it s not always been good news for the biotech as back in June of last year it announced that it suspended two planned clinical studies of its CRF antagonist NBI-77860 out of  an abundance of caution. 

This came after the company said it had found  certain recent preclinical findings that we had not observed in previous animal studies. ","Pharmaceuticals"

Vectura shares fell as much as 10% after it revealed the Phase III study missed its primary endpoint, quashing near-term hopes of expanding the use of a drug it acquired in the  441 million ($576 million) merger with Skyepharma.

Vectura s partner Mundipharma enrolled 1,767 patients in the study and randomized them to receive one of two doses of Flutiform or an active comparator, formoterol. After 52 weeks of daily dosing with the drugs, the study team analyzed the annual rate of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations in each arm. The key comparison was between the higher dose of Flutiform and the long-acting beta2 agonist (LABA) formoterol. Mundipharma was hoping to see evidence Flutiform is better at controlling COPD exacerbations than formoterol.

In this regard, the experimental therapy fell short, resulting in the trial missing its primary endpoint. Mundipharma is now digging through the other endpoints, which compared the lower Flutiform dose to formoterol and looked at exacerbations, lung function and safety in each of the arms. But the failure to meet the primary endpoint has scuttled Mundipharma s plan to apply for approval in Europe on the strength of the Phase III data.

That news was seen by investors as serious enough to send shares in Vectura down 10% in early trading in London, although the stock rallied to make up some of the losses by midmorning. Faced with lengthening odds of LABA-inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) combination Flutiform winning approval in COPD, Vectura CEO James Ward-Lilley sought to play up both the challenge of improving on standard of care and the potential to grow sales in other indications.

 COPD is a complex and highly variable disease and these trial results highlight the challenge in demonstrating reductions of exacerbations with ICS/LABA combinations in today s treatment environment,  Ward-Lilley said in a statement.  Whilst this result is disappointing, flutiform continues to grow strongly based on the approved asthma indication. 

Flutiform racked up sales of  92.4 million in the first 6 months of 2016, an increase of 42% over the comparable period of 2015. But, while there is still scope for Vectura to grow sales of Flutiform in its existing asthma indication, the potential loss of the COPD market nonetheless represents a blow to the company's plans to build its business and justify the merger with Skyepharma.

The failure of the addition of an ICS to a LABA to improve on the latter alone is in keeping with data from other COPD drug developers. GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK) and Theravance Biopharma ($TBPH) encountered a similar setback during the development of Breo, but ultimately succeeded in winning approval for the once-daily ICS/LABA.","Pharmaceuticals"

This is at least the third recent biotech reverse merger, coming amid the typical IPO doldrums of August.

Reverse mergers may be losing their stigma, especially considering recent high-profile success stories that started out that way and are now worth billions, such as Medivation ($MDVN) and Puma Biotechnology ($PUMA). Leap Therapeutics was formerly known as Dekkun and reported its first and only prior financing of almost $10 million in 2011.

The combined company will have $30 million, including an additional $10 million from Leap investors including HealthCare Ventures. That firm holds three seats on Leap s five-person board, including the company s CEO, Christopher Mirabelli, who is a HealthCare Ventures managing director.

""The combination with Macrocure positions our organization as a leading immuno-oncology company with sufficient capital to advance our pipeline of first-in-class monoclonal antibodies through significant value-creating events,"" said Mirabelli in a statement.

The resulting company will focus on the two early stage clinical cancer antibodies being developed at Leap: DKN-01, a humanized monoclonal antibody targeting the Dickkopf-1 (DKK1) protein, and TRX518, a humanized GITR agonist monoclonal antibody designed to improve the immune system's antitumor response. The company will be focused on developing these two monoclonal antibody candidates going forward.

Continued Mirabelli, ""We anticipate achieving substantial clinical milestones over the course of 2016 and 2017. We plan to present data and initiate randomized studies for DKN-01, our lead development candidate, which has demonstrated clinical activity in esophageal cancer and cholangiocarcinoma when combined with chemotherapy; and we expect to report data from a repeat-dose study of TRX518, a novel GITR agonist monoclonal antibody which is believed to enhance an immune anti-tumor response.""

Macrocure investors will hold about 31.8% of the resulting company, while Leap shareholders get about 68.2% of it. Macrocure will officially become a subsidiary of Leap; the executive team at Leap will retain all their positions in the Cambridge, MA-based company. The boards of both companies have agreed to the deal, which is expected to close around year end.

Wall Street drove up Macrocure shares on news of the deal by about 66%. Still, that only pushed the penny stock to a valuation of around $35 million, scarcely more than its cash that s slated at deal close.","Pharmaceuticals"

CBT has closed the $9.75 million Series A financing (that includes $2 million in warrants), and with the proceeds, along with $5 million seed funding from its parent, the Californian biotech Crown Bioscience, sees the fledgling biotech s operating capital nudge up to $14.75 million.

The company is currently working on a pipeline of four candidates, with its two leading compounds being CBT-101 and CBT-501.

The former is an oral c-Met inhibitor designed to target the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) pathway in certain cancers, while the latter is a PD-1 checkpoint inhibitor, which works by helping the body s immune system recognize and help kill tumors.

It s also got at the back of its pipeline a preclinical multi-targeted kinase inhibitor that is designed to go after uncontrolled growth signaling pathways and PD-L1 antibody.

CBT says it is  seeking partners for combination therapies  with its PD-1 and PDL-1 antibodies. This may include it going after big players such as Merck ($MRK), Bristol-Myers ($BMY) and Roche ($RHHBY), who all have approved PD-1/PD-L1 meds on the market, but have also set up a number of combo trials with other cancer drugs to try and boost efficacy.

Its board includes chair Guo-Liang Yu, also executive chairman of Crown Bioscience International and Jonathan Wang, senior M.D. and co-founder of OrbiMed Asia. The biotech s CEO and president is Sanjeev Redkar, who also founded the company this year.

 This financing allows us to advance two of our four development programs into human clinical trials,  said Redkar.

 CBT-101, a highly specific inhibitor of the c-MET receptor, has shown robust activity in patient-derived xenograft (PDX) models with a wide safety margin. CBT-101 is currently in a Phase I trial in China, and we plan to initiate a Phase I study in the United States in early 2017 to evaluate the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy in cancer patients with c-MET dysregulated malignancies.

 We also plan to initiate a Phase 1 study of CBT-501, an anti PD-1 monoclonal antibody, in south-east Asia in 2017. An Investigational Drug Application has been filed and CBT-501 is also awaiting the start of a Phase I trial in China. 

Its biggest backer, OrbiMed Asia--the Asian unit of OrbiMed--has offices in Shanghai and Mumbai and a kitty of more than $500 million under management.","Pharmaceuticals"

But now he and his team, including co-founder Juan Jaen, are aiming for an even more ambitious goal--building a major immuno-oncology biopharma from the ground up with upstart Arcus Biosciences.

The Hayward, CA-based startup was founded in May 2015, shortly after the Flexus sale, and has raised a total of about $120 million in two financings already. The company had opted to remain in stealth mode thus far.

That s despite ample interest in the next efforts of this management team, which is comprised largely of Flexus execs--some of whom trace their roots back to Amgen, where Rosen was a longtime executive who finished his career there as VP of Therapeutic Discovery and South San Francisco site head.

An obvious expression of this group s confidence is that the first $30 million invested in Arcus came from its founders and other  friends and family  investors; The Column Group, Foresite Capital, Novartis ($NVS) and Celgene ($CELG) rounded out the Series A financing that dates back to May 2015 and totaled $49.7 million. The Column Group and Celgene were both also Flexus investors.

Arcus opted to raise another $70 million this August--despite having touched very little of the Series A cash. But by late last year, early research had proven promising enough to accelerate initial research--and financing--plans.

At the outset, we had thought to advance just one in 2017 and the next in 2018,  Arcus CEO Rosen told FierceBiotech in an exclusive interview.  We still had $40 million left, but we wanted to expand what we were doing and push the other programs faster. 

That oversubscribed round was expanded from an initial $50 million to accommodate the addition of new investors including GV, which led, as well as Invus, Taiho Ventures, DROIA Oncology Ventures and Stanford University, which had the right to participate as part of a technology licensing deal. All the existing investors also participated.

The startup has scaled up its hiring, with an aim of 60 employees by year end, up from the previously planned 38. Arcus has set up shop in the East Bay, in a less expensive locale than San Francisco or Silicon Valley.

Beyond the general immuno-oncology frothiness, which Rosen expects will result in a lot of disappointing data in the next year or so because of poorly planned combination trials, Rosen and his team are committed to the big vision behind immuno-oncology.

 Immuno-oncology is a very unique, rare situation,  said Arcus  Rosen.  The body should be able to kill tumors, but the reality is that most things tried in the past haven t worked so well. 

He continued,  Recent trials with immune checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1 antibodies, have shown that if you can get the immune system to do what it s supposed to do, you can treat cancer. The academic community has been working away and sorting out the biology very aggressively.   We have decades of biological research that hasn t been translated into drug discovery. 

 This is something to double down on--we re going to bet big,  concluded Rosen as an explanation for why he s working to build Arcus as a long-term company.  This is the last field in which I will probably ever work. 

Arcus is working on small molecule and antibody I/O approaches with the aim of building its own internal combinations. Rosen likens the combo land-grab around I/O as likely to shape up along similar lines as the hepatitis C combo race--in which there were some major winners and losers on the path to assembling relevant combinations.

The company has selected its first three targets for small molecules along the ATP-adenosine pathway; CD73, CD39 and the A2A receptor. The idea is to use multiple means to discourage the extracellular enzymatic conversion of ATP, which is released by damaged or dying cells, into adenosine; the former encourages an immune response to cancer cells while the latter discourages it.

 Normally, ATP is released by cells as they die or are damaged,  explained Rosen.  It s a signal to the rest of the immune system to mount an inflammatory response. But ATP is converted to adenosine and by converting ATP to adenosine, not only is the signal to mount an immune response reduced, but adenosine also tells the immune system to stand down. 

Arcus plans to select a clinical candidate from its CD73 program, which is expected to be its lead, during the last quarter of this year. It, along with the A2A antagonist program, are both slated to reach the clinic next year.

The startup is also doing preclinical work on monoclonal antibodies, which they expect could result in backbone cancer therapies. They are specifically intended to complement the workings of the small molecules. Arcus is aiming not just for individual candidate activity, but for a combination effect with its own as well as external drugs. The company expects to have up to three of these antibodies in the clinic in 2018.

Arcus hasn t ruled out future deals to gain adjacent technology, such as cell-based therapies and gene editing, which could work well with its other approaches. It is going after three areas where it hopes to have best-in-class combinations: the elimination of active mechanisms of immune suppression, enhanced function of the APC (antigen presenting cells) as well as enhanced T cell, NK cell and macrophage effector activity.

Ultimately, Arcus is betting on a vision of personalized immuno-oncology treatment based on activity in a particular tumor.  Now, we are bucketing patients based on the organ of origin,  Arcus President Juan Jaen said.  What was the site of the origin of the tumor and what was the route of therapy? It s very, very crude. 

He continued,  We re moving toward more molecular or cellular analysis of what s going on in their particular tumor. That presents opportunities to further customize the agent or combination of agents. A couple of decades from now, the large majority of patients can be taken down a very specific path.

It was in fact this study that at the start of the year prompted the U.S. regulator to slap a full clinical hold on the biotech, halting dosing and persuading CTI to yank its newly completed drug application, given the high level of adverse events and deaths from the test.

The biotech had been given a fast-track status by the FDA in 2014, but the deaths in PERSIST-2 in pacritinib-treated patients, which included intracranial hemorrhage, cardiac failure and cardiac arrest, alarmed the FDA so greatly it said it could not allow its continuance.

The regulator recommended back in February that the biotech conduct dose exploration studies for pacritinib in patients with myelofibrosis, and submit final study reports and datasets for its two studies PERSIST-1 and PERSIST-2.

Today, it has posted some new data for the drug, which is partnered with Baxalta (now Shire) from PERSIST-2. This Phase III trial compared pacritinib, an oral multikinase inhibitor, with other available therapies such as Novartis  ($NVS) Jakavi (ruxolitinib), for patients with myelofibrosis whose platelet counts are less than 100,000 per microliter--a patient population with high-risk advanced disease.

Just over 300 patients were enrolled in the study, which formed the basis for the safety analysis, according to the biotech, but only 221 patients reached week 24 (the primary analysis time point) before the clinical hold was imposed.

CTI said that its preliminary results showed from these patients that the PERSIST-2 trial met one of the co-primary endpoints, showing a statistically significant response rate in spleen volume reduction in patients with myelofibrosis treated with pacritinib compared to JAK2 inhibitor Jakavi.

But it did however fail to meet its other co-primary endpoint, of greater than 50% reduction in total symptom score.

The biotech said that the most common treatment emergent adverse events for pacritinib were  generally manageable diarrhea, nausea and vomiting. 

The incidence of cardiac and bleeding adverse events (all grades and grade 3-4 including deaths) were similar across the arms, it added, with overall mortality rates  comparable between arms. 

Additional data from ongoing analyses along with top-line results from PERSIST-2 are slated to be posted at an upcoming scientific meeting.

 Having analyzed data from two Phase III trials with the only JAK inhibitor to be studied in severely thrombocytopenic patients, including patients on JAK2 therapy or those who failed prior JAK2, we are encouraged by pacritinib's clinical profile in this difficult-to-treat group of patients with myelofibrosis,  said James Bianco, president and CEO of CTI BioPharma.

 We are grateful for the support and commitment of the investigators, our steering committee and, most importantly, all the patients who participated in PERSIST-2.  Despite the upbeat tone, the clinical hold still remains on the biotech.

The biotech was marginally up 1.45% at the end of play Friday, before the data were posted, but is still locked in penny-stock territory with shares trading at 35 cents and with a market cap of just $100 million.","Pharmaceuticals"

The drug, condoliase, is seen by Ferring as giving patients with lumbar disc herniation a nonsurgical way of managing the leg pain resulting from their condition.

Seikagaku has advanced the drug into two Phase III trials designed to give it the data it needs to win approval in the U.S. Having initiated this process, Seikagaku will stay in charge throughout the Phase III trials and subsequent regulatory filing, before handing off to Ferring in the event it wins approval. Ferring will then commercialize the drug in the U.S., while also potentially running the trials needed to win approval in other markets.

The deal sees Ferring pay an undisclosed upfront fee, plus development and regulatory milestones and sales royalties. An earlier release to disclose a letter of intent between the companies put the size of the upfront at $5 million ( 4.5 million). In return, Ferring is gaining the rights to a drug it and some third parties think can provide another option to patients who suffer pain as the result of lumbar disc herniation, a degenerative process affecting intervertebral discs.

 Condoliase could offer a non-surgical alternative to patients for whom conservative therapy and/or corticosteroid injections have failed to provide durable relief, while maintaining the option for surgery should it later become medically necessary,  Dr. Ray Baker, a former president of the North American Spine Society, said in a statement.

Seikagaku has already tested condoliase, also known as SI-6603, in a Phase III trial in Japan. The 163-patient study found a single injection of condoliase was better than placebo at improving scores of worst leg pain. After 13 weeks, the leg pain scores of 72% of patients in the condoliase cohort improved by 50% or more compared with the baseline. Approximately half of patients in the placebo arm experienced similar improvements. Condoliase was also associated with improvements in physical function and quality of life scores.

Notably, while the treatment cohort featured a higher frequency of reports of back pain and other adverse events, Seikagaku saw the overall safety profile as supporting continued development of the drug. Condoliase works by chemonucleolysis, the process of using an enzyme to dissolve part of the disc. Another product with the same mechanism of action, Chymopapain, was subject to multiple lawsuits before being pulled from the U.S. market in 2003.

Ferring is now looking to enable physicians to once again offer chemonucleolysis and, in doing so, build out its portfolio of orthopedic treatments. The Swiss drugmaker has engaged in checkbook pipeline building over the past two years to expand its orthopedic range, adding Phase III assets through deals with BioSurface Engineering Technologies and now Seikagaku.","Pharmaceuticals"

But questions, and the need for more clinical data, remain.

The San Diego, CA-based biotech has published new top-line data from the ESC Congress in Rome that used its allogeneic mesenchymal stem cells, delivered through an IV, to heart failure patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The biotech used a number of endpoints to assess efficacy, including a 6-minute walk test and the KCCQ Clinical Summary score, both of which hit statistical significance, although exact figures were not released.

There was however only a  trend to improvement  in KCCQ Functional Status score, with the data also showing the stem cell therapy can suppress inflammation, something the biotech stresses is  noteworthy because inflammation is believed to importantly contribute to [heart failure] HF progression.  There was in addition a statistically significant reduction in natural killer cells.

But overall, there was no difference in cardiac structure and function and the company had to dig deep with some  exploratory data analysis  to show that there was a statistically significant improvement in the left ventricular end systolic and diastolic volumes in the stem cell-treated groups--something it said that was not seen in the placebo-treated group.

The single-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study gave the treatment to just 22 enrolled patients with nonischemic cardiomyopathy.

The test was set up to randomize patients, with both CardioCell's treatment and the placebo given intravenously. At 90 days after the first injection, the control group received CardioCell's treatment, and the original treatment group received the placebo solution.

Dr. Mihai Gheorghiade, a protocol co-designer of this study and a member of CardioCell's scientific advisory board, said these data showed that its therapy  improved well-being of the patients that have already been on evidence-based HF therapy.  He added:  This is very innovative and marks a new beginning in HF management, especially in light of negative results of many drug-intervention trials. 

There have also been other stem cell therapy failures in heart failure, including over the summer when Celyad missed the primary endpoints in its CHART-1 study in certain heart patients. It did however find that a  positive trend was clearly identifiable,  with its C-Cure treatment, meaning it could still try for an EMA application using the subgroup analyses.

CardioCell said future studies will necessarily be needed in larger studies with a focus on clinical endpoints to assess just how well its treatment works, and most importantly whether it can boost how well the heart works in these patients.

 Based on these promising clinical-trial findings, CardioCell is excited to be developing larger studies based on IV delivery of our [therapy] for heart failure indications, including both non-ischemic and ischemic cardiomyopathy,  says Sergey Sikora, CEO of CardioCell and co-author of the study.

 We are very encouraged by the degree of statistically significant improvement in patient health status, and we look forward to exploring whether multiple IV treatments will lead to further improvement, including cardiac function. 

CardioCell gets its therapy from parent company Stemedica, which are derived from bone-marrow.

This is a similar approach used by San Carlos, CA-based BioCardia, which earlier this year dropped plans for a $50 million IPO, which also uses a bone marrow-derived therapy. In a previous Phase II study with 30 patients its treatment CardiAMP  supported efficacy relative to patient quality of life and functional capacity, which was shown to be both statistically and clinically significant.

It s aiming for approvals in these niche indications--as well as in bigger markets for hematological malignancies and autoimmune disorders.

It has secured the orphan tag for both its TG-1101 (ublituximab), a glycoengineered anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody, to treat neuromyelitis optica (NMO) and neuromyelitis optica spectrum disorder (NMOSD) and its TGR-1202, an oral, next-gen PI3K Delta inhibitor, to treat with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL).

""NMO is closely related to multiple sclerosis, an area of significant interest to us,  said the company s CEO Michael Weiss in a statement.  We look forward to presenting early data from our current Phase 1b study of TG-1101 in NMO at the ECTRIMS (European Committee for the Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis) conference this September, which we believe will provide an early peek into the effects of TG-1101 in patients with autoimmune diseases.""

It s looking for a larger market with TG-1101 in autoimmune disease multiple sclerosis (MS). The company plans to advance TG-1101 into pivotal testing in MS during the first half of next year.

The B cell malignancy and autoimmune disease small cap is ultimately aiming to combine TG-1101 with approved CLL agent Imbruvica (ibrutinib), as well as with its with its own TGR-1202 to treat CLL and diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

Discussing the GENUINE Phase III trial of TG-1101 in combination with ibrutinib in high-risk CLL, Weiss said on the company s most recent earnings call,  We've launched this study with the hope and intention that this will be a fast andstraightforward approach to getting TG-1101 approved. Recall, at the time we designed this study, we were very uncertain of what the FDA would require to get two novel drugs approved simultaneously. 

He continued,  We still believe that GENUINE's goal of improving on ibrutinib therapy represents an important treatment goal. There is no question that ibruitinib is a very good drug but few if any patients are cured with single agent ibruitinib. Our Phase II study demonstrated increases in overall response as well as a deepening of responses with 25% of the patients on the combination of ibrutinib plus TG-1101 obtaining either a complete response and/or MRD (minimal residual disease) negativity.

This is just shy of its $650 million total, according to its SEC filing, but represents a big leap over its ninth fund, completed back in 2014, which saw it hit $500 million.

In recent years the VC has helped a number of biotech companies with funding, which saw it lead a $65 million round last year for gene therapy specialist Audentes in its Series C. The biotech announced a month ago that it was now seeking a $75 million IPO.

And back in May, its portfolio company Merus announced it was gunning for a $65 million public offering on the Nasdaq to help shore up its cash for future midstage cancer trials.

The IPO market has been tricky this year for many biotechs, but VC raises have gone from strength to strength. This year alone has seen a series of major funds, including Arch s plans for a $400M-plus for venture fund, announced earlier this year, as it looks to build up on its already impressive portfolio that includes Juno ($JUNO) and bluebird ($BLUE).

California investment firm Vivo Capital, known for its big pharma and med dev raises, also in June closed a new healthcare venture capital fund at over $100 million that will include a percentage being funneled into startup biotechs.

Meanwhile, in the same month, European venture outfit Life Sciences Partners raised $280 million toward a new biotech fund--surpassing its $170 million target. Fellow European venture capital firm Forbion Capital Partners also closed is third flagship life sciences fund at  183 million ($208 million), while another VC firm, SV Life Sciences, recently announced it was nearing its 2015 target of raising $400 million in its sixth fund round.

And it s not just traditional life science VC firms either as Swiss wealth management company UBS raised $471 million in April for the final closing of the UBS  Oncology Impact Fund --an investing initiative aimed at developing new cancer treatments.

All of these together sees a total global series of funding for life sciences of around $2.5 billion.

First up, the figures, which saw operating income for the past 6 months hit  7 million ($7.9 million), up from  4.3 million it made in the same period last year, as it enjoyed the fruits of collabs with Leo Pharma in February and AbbVie ($ABBV) in April.

The latter deal was in fact worth a potential $685 million and is based around its preclinical immuno-oncology candidate, which could hit a host of cancer targets.

This contender, ARGX-115, works by stimulating a patient s immune system after a tumor has suppressed the immune system by co-opting different immunosuppressive cells such as regulatory T-cells (Tregs)--which can inhibit other immune effector cells through the production of active TGF- .

The company also sold shares worth about  16 million ($17.5 million) to the major U.S. asset manager Federated Investors at the start of the year, as it looked to take a step further into the U.S. market.

The biotech has previously told FierceBiotech that it will likely one day soon seek to list on the Nasdaq. In June, the company also raised an extra  33 million from U.S. investors.

In an update on its experimental meds in the clinic, argenx said it was set to start its first combo trial in leukemia in the second half of the year, with its trial design to be presented at its upcoming R&D day.

The biotech spent  11.2 million in research by the end of June compared with the  9.3 million at the same point last year. This increase, the biotech said, was mainly due to the hiring on new R&D staffers, given its increased activities, as well as the share-based payment costs recognized in compensation for the grant of stock options to the R&D employees.

But argenx has also culled several collabs, including all research under its former pact, and exclusive product license option agreement, with Bayer.

This collaboration originally started back in May 2014 and sought to validate the SIMPLE Antibody program. But the deal has now been ended, and argenx said it  will re-deploy resources from the Bayer collaboration to support its own proprietary programs as well as its Innovative Access Program. 

It also terminated the contract with Leukemia & Lymphoma Society following the  corporate decision  to not study ARGX-110, its lead cancer candidate, in Waldestr m's macroglobulinemia.

Its CEO Tim Van Hauwermeiren was however pleased with a  seminal quarter.  He said:  We made substantial progress against several very important corporate goals: advancing our clinical and other pipeline programs and in closing a significant financing with key U.S. institutional investors as well as entering into a strategic transaction with AbbVie for our oncology candidate AGRX-115.

 We believe these accomplishments have driven argenx forward to become a new and more substantial company with a full and mature clinical pipeline, an advanced platform and the financial and strategic support to derive value from them.

 During the quarter we announced data from our Phase I MAD and SAD studies of ARGX-113 which led to the selection of our Phase II dose and demonstrated the drug's strong safety profile and its ability to rapidly reduce IgG levels in healthy volunteers.

 Our lead oncology candidate ARGX-110 showed further evidence of anti-tumor activity in T-cell lymphoma patients and is on track to announce top-line data in this expansion cohort by end of year. We are looking forward to executing on our strategic plan for the remainder of 2016 to bring ARGX-113 into two Phase II indications and to examine the breadth of potential for ARGX-110 as a monotherapy and a combination agent in TCL and AML.

This is the second time it has been hit with this warning, having had the same letter back in February. This initial 180-day period ended this week, but the Nasdaq has given it until next February to get its shares up.

Gaithersburg, MD-based GenVec ($GNVC) has not had the rosiest of times. Back in 2012, its lead program, a gene therapy for pancreatic cancer, failed to deliver in the clinic, as it desperately looked for a buyer.

This didn t happen, and the then new CEO Cynthia Collin stepped in and took the ax to around a third of its workforce to keep costs down. A year later she left as the company struggled to remain solvent, with Douglas Swirsky, the company s former CFO, stepping in as its new chief with a new direction.

Things have been looking up in more recent months when back in July the FDA lifted the clinical hold on a Phase I/II trial, developed in collaboration with Novartis, of CGF166 in patients with severe to profound hearing loss.

This drug was created via the biotech s AdenoVerse technology platform that is deisgned to use genes to treat or stop certain diseases. But its history of poor results in the lab and financial struggles have not endeared investors.

Things looked more promising back in early 2010 when GenVec inked a $213 development million pact with Novartis.

The drug, BioChaperone PDGF, was penciled in to start pivotal trials in Europe and the U.S., but weak data from an Indian Phase III study have prompted Adocia to halt all development of the asset.

Lyon, France-based Adocia expressed surprise at the top-line data. The 252-person trial pitted the experimental therapy against standard of care--saline solution--and assessed which was associated with more completed wound closures following 20 weeks of treatment. BioChaperone PDGF failed to clear this bar, resulting in the study missing its primary endpoint. Adocia opened down 9% in Paris.

 Diabetic foot ulcer has proved an extremely difficult condition to address, as seen in multiple recent late-stage clinical trial failures,  Adocia CEO G rard Soula said in a statement.  The main reason is the lack of uniformity in the standard of care of these types of wounds. 

Over the past 12 months, Derma Sciences ($DSCI) and Israel s MacroCure ($MCUR) have both posted negative Phase III data on diabetic foot ulcer candidates. Derma scrapped its study following a futility analysis. MacroCure got to the end of its 16-week trial, but failed to show its cell therapy was better than a placebo.

With BioChaperone PDGF joining these drugs on the list of diabetic foot ulcer programs to post weak clinical trial data, Adocia has decided to drop the asset. The decision ends Adocia s ambition to test the candidate in the U.S. and Europe, and brings the drawn out final steps in the story of the diabetic foot ulcer program to a close.

Adocia posted Phase II data on the asset in 2012, at which time the performance of BioChaperone PDGF against Smith & Nephew s (LON:SN) Regranex in a 192-person study prompted the French biotech to plan to start Phase III studies in India, the U.S. and Europe within 18 months. That plan proved to be wildly optimistic. While Adocia filed to start a Phase III trial in India in September 2012, turmoil at the country s regulator meant it took almost two years to get the dossier approved.

The plan was to include data from the Indian trial in a regulatory filing in Europe, enabling Adocia to win approval on its home continent on the back of one local trial. With the Phase III fail scuttling that strategy, Adocia is shifting its attention to the bigger, but earlier-stage, opportunities in its pipeline, notably the Eli Lilly ($LLY)-partnered BioChaperone Lispro.

Adocia and Lilly have established a bedrock of early to mid-phase evidence that the insulin can give diabetics more flexibility in terms of when they take the drug. The next step is to put this to the test in a Phase III trial. Lilly had looked set to advance the drug into Phase III before the end of the year, triggering what Jefferies analysts estimate will be a  40 million ($45 million) milestone payment, but the timing has slipped recently.

In last month s quarterly earnings call, Lilly said it will start a Phase III trial of an ultra-rapid insulin in 2017, later than previously expected. The use of the term  ultra-rapid insulin  could be telling, too. Lilly has two drugs that fit this description in its mid-phase pipeline, namely Adocia s BioChaperone Lispro and an internally-developed candidate. Lilly doesn t name the internal program on its pipeline page, but it has been trialling LY900014 against Humalog over the past 18 months.

The presence of a rival to BioChaperone Lispro in Lilly s internal pipeline exposes Adocia to the sort of situation Galapagos ($GLPG) faced when awaiting AbbVie s ($ABBV) decision on filgotinib. In that case, Galapagos appeared to have the more validated drug, but the opportunity to steal a lead in the race to market and free itself from milestone payments proved too attractive for AbbVie to resist.

Adocia now faces a wait until it learns whether Lilly will follow AbbVie s lead. Lilly had already walked away from Adocia once. In 2013, it canned a partnership struck 18 months earlier, only to enter into a fresh agreement in 2014.

This is a form of multiple sclerosis that typically follows after relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS).

Most patients with RRMS eventually transition into SPMS in which there is progressive degradation of neurologic function; there are few treatment options for these patients.

""SPMS is a particularly disabling form of MS, and there is a need for effective treatment options to help delay disability progression in those living with the condition,"" said Vasant Narasimhan, global head of drug development and chief medical officer for Novartis, in a statement. ""The positive EXPAND data are encouraging for a disease with such a high unmet need.""

The pharma said that the oral, once-daily BAF312 (siponimod) met the primary endpoint of a reduction in disability progression risk as compared to placebo in the 1,651-patient EXPAND trial. Patients were randomized to drug and placebo at a 2:1 ratio, respectively.

It didn t disclose if the trial met the secondary endpoints of delay in the time to 6-month confirmed disability progression versus placebo, the time to confirmed worsening of at least 20% from baseline in the timed 25-foot walk test, T2 lesion volume, annualized relapse rate, and the safety and tolerability of BAF312 in people with SPMS.

The primary endpoint was measured at three months using the expanded disability status scale (EDSS). Detailed data on the primary and secondary endpoints will be presented as a late-breaker at European Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ECTRIMS) in London in September.

Novartis has a substantial commitment to multiple sclerosis; it markets S1P modulator Gilenya  (fingolimod) and Extavia (interferon beta-1b for subcutaneous injection) both in relapsing MS. Extavia is also approved in Europe to treat secondary progressive MS (SPMS) in active disease patients. Novartis is also developing monoclonal antibody ofatumumab (OMB157), which it in-licensed last year from GlaxoSmithKline ($GSK), to treat relapsing MS with Phase III trials slated to start in the second half.

Via its generic Sandoz division, Novartis also markets MS treatments Glatopa (glatiramer acetate injection), the first generic version of Teva's Copaxone.

Novartis had pushed back the release of this data a bit from the anticipated mid-year timeline.

 In terms of BAF312, we originally had planned to lock the database in Q2. We will lock the database in Q3,  said Vasant Narasimhan, Novartis Global Head Drug Development and CMO, on the company s most recent earnings call.

He added,  This is primarily because of our wanting to assure that we had solid data, given the length of the study. And we had just some quality issues we wanted to resolve. 

The pharma plans to submit BAF312 to regulators to treat SPMS in 2019.

Despite the potential cautions presented by such difficult terrain, investors have plowed another $130 million into a Series B to back the startup that s led by Genentech vets. The latest infusion brings its total raised to almost $350 million.

The company has filed to start its first Phase I trial in Europe for a small molecule RIP1 inhibitor that can penetrate into the central nervous system (CNS). RIP1 is a kinase involved in regulating inflammatory signaling that can affect the brain s glial dysfunction. The drug is slated to be tested in ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis) and Alzheimer's disease patients, after this initial safety trial in healthy volunteers.

""Mounting genetic evidence points to glial dysfunction as an accelerator of neurodegeneration, and we believe that advancing our RIP1 inhibitor into human clinical testing is a significant step in bringing forward a novel mechanism to combat ALS and Alzheimer's disease,"" said Denali CMO Dr. Carole Ho in a statement. She was previously the VP of Early Clinical Development at Genentech.

Denali is focused on four specific pathways that it sees as triggers or effectors of neurodegeneration: degenogenes (genes that cause neurodegenerative disease when mutated), defective intracellular trafficking, glial dysfunction and axon degeneration. It aims to develop treatment strategies for each of these that are driven by biomarkers.

The South San Francisco, CA-based company ultimately aims to have a portfolio of therapies to address diseases including Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, ALS and others. The financing and deals are aimed at  building out Denali's systematic and novel approaches and capabilities to defeat degeneration,"" described Denali CEO Ryan Watts. He was the Director of the Department of Neuroscience at Genentech.

Denali disclosed a handful of deals that give it access to a range of new technology and approaches to neurodegenerative diseases headed up by the acquisition of Incro Pharmaceuticals for its RIP1 inhibitor program that s in-licensed from Harvard University and a global license with Roche s Genentech ($ROG) to develop and commercialize LRRK2 inhibitors for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.

""Partnerships are central to Denali's strategy and we continue to seek collaborations to discover and develop effective medicines for patients,"" said Denali COO Dr. Alex Schuth in a statement. He was the Director and Head Technology and Diagnostics Partnering and, prior to that, the Head of Neuroscience Partnering at Genentech.

In addition, Denali disclosed a trio of research collaborations with: Washington University School of Medicine to develop and market antibodies targeting ApoE in Alzheimer s disease; the U.K. s F-Star to develop therapies that cross the blood-brain barrier; and Blaze Bioscience to research and discover drugs that cross the blood-brain barrier at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center.

The latest financing was led by U.K.-based mutual fund Baillie Gifford with participation from several, undisclosed,  new and large institutional investors,  the company said. All the founding investors participated; its Series A investors include Alaska Permanent Fund, ARCH Venture Partners, Flagship Ventures and F-Prime Capital Partners.

The joint venture will use cash from both its parent companies to develop Israel-originated compounds picked out by BioLineRx, before looking for outside investment once its portfolio reaches a certain size.

Tel Aviv, Israel-based BioLineRx expects iPharma to add the first program to its pipeline in the coming months. Details of which asset it is looking at are yet to emerge, but BioLineRx has said what sort of compounds iPharma will develop. The focus is early-stage candidates, primarily discovered in Israel, that are a good fit for the therapeutic needs of China. BioLineRx is responsible for sourcing the drugs, while VC shop I-Bridge Capital is on board to provide knowledge of the Chinese market and money.

The partners are chipping in $1 million ( 900,000) apiece to help iPharma get started. This seed cash is meant to get iPharma through the process of building its pipeline of early-stage assets. Once it has completed this stage of its evolution, iPharma plans to look to outside investors for the cash it needs to grow into a fully-fledged biotech.

While the deal is small, it is part of a much larger trend that contributed to bilateral trade between China and Israel to growing from $50 million in 1992 to $11 billion in 2013. Both countries have a thing the other wants. Israel has a thriving startup scene but a population of 8 million people. China has a population of 1.4 billion people but a relative lack of startups. In the BioLineRx deal, as in many others across multiple industries, Israel is providing the innovation, China is supplying the market.

 The market in China is large and fast-growing, but it lacks innovative therapeutic assets and capabilities which address the increasing demands of our rapidly aging population,  I-Bridge Managing Partner Jimmy Wei said in a statement.  BioLineRx, with its well-established relationships with leading academic institutions and biomedical companies in Israel, as well as its proven project screening process, is an ideal long-term partner for us. 

Such partnerships are emerging as something of a sideline for BioLineRx. While the company s in-house R&D efforts have yet to live up to the hype that surrounded its $50 million Tel Aviv IPO--by far the largest biomedical offering on the exchange at the time--it has become an entryway into Israel for third parties.

Novartis ($NVS) recognized the potential for BioLineRx to fulfill this role in 2014, at which time the Big Pharma invested $10 million in the biotech and tasked it with sniffing out assets in Israel. The collaboration was slow to get going, but took a step forward earlier this month when BioLineRx secured the rights to a nonalcoholic steatohepatitis drug.

Shares in BioLineRx rose 8% on the back of the joint venture news.

The Durham, NC-based company, which is around a decade old, is working on nitric oxide based therapies for dermatologic indications, including acne.

According to its SEC-1 filing, the company plans to list on the Nasdaq under the symbol $NOVN.

Nitric oxide plays a vital role in the immune system response against microbial pathogens and helps regulate inflammation.

Novan is working on a pipeline of meds that are designed to harness nitric oxide and its multiple mechanisms of action, and is the underlying tech behind its Nitricil platform. The idea is to use this platform to convert a useful, naturally occurring molecule into a therapeutic pipeline for a host of skin diseases.

The biotech is pushing on with programs in five dermatological conditions, with its lead candidate, SB204, a topical gel that targets multiple mechanisms of action for the treatment of acne vulgaris--the most common skin disease in the U.S.

Two pivotal Phase III tests started in Q1 for the med, and Novan said in its SEC filing that it expects to report top-line results from these studies at the start of next year. An NDA for SB204 should, all things going well, be on the cards by year-end 2017.

Other pipeline candidates include midstage meds SB206, SB208 and preclinical treatment SB414, which are targeted toward the treatment of either a specific microorganism or inflammatory components of a disease pathology.

SB206 is a first-in-class, topical anti-viral gel aimed at viral skin infections, such as external genital and perianal warts caused by human papillomavirus. SB208 is a topical broad-spectrum anti-fungal product candidate for the treatment of fungal infections of the skin and nails. SB414, a topical cream, is being looked at as a treatment of inflammatory skin diseases such as psoriasis and atopic dermatitis.

Malin Life Sciences Holdings is currently the company s its largest stockholder.

Peterson s role sees her become the new chief medical officer of immuno-oncology at China and U.S.-based BeiGene ($BGNE) and will focus on the development of BGB-A317, the biotech s PD-1 inhibitor, and BGB-290, its PARP inhibitor, as well as other I/O candidates.

This announcement comes just three days after Pfizer confirmed its $14 billion buyout of Medivation ($MDVN), and also after some analysts recently touted larger peak sales estimates for its PARP talazoparib, which is in Phase III for BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Pfizer has over the years developed a reputation of being ruthless post-merger and cutting research programs and scientists where needs be, although it is unclear whether Dr. Peterson would have made the decision before Pfizer had decided to buy the company outright.

At Medivation, she was primarily responsible for the development of talazoparib and also of its troubled cancer candidate pidilizumab in diffuse large b-cell lymphoma. Before joining the Californian biotech, she worked at cancer powerhouse Genentech.

The company bought talazoparib from BioMarin ($BMRN) a year ago for just over $400 million upfront, and was a key pipeline promise on which Pfizer ($PFE) has hung its billions of dollars upon.

Her new focus, BGB-290, is currently in Phase I studies in ovarian cancer, and the biotech posted data late last year showing that of the 14 ovarian cancer patients for whom there were evaluable data, 7 had an objective response, with one having a complete response and 6 seeing partial responses.

Both BeiGene and Medivation believe their candidates will yield better results than AstraZeneca s ($AZN) approved PARP Lynparza (olaparib), which has a U.S. license as a maintenance treatment of women with BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer.

Another small biotech, Tesaro, ($TSRO), also posted recent data for its PARP inhibitor hope niraparib, which saw some impressive ovarian cancer figures, boosting it shares by more than 100% on the day the numbers were released.

Peterson said nothing of her former position at Medivation or the reasons behind her departure, or whether it was made during the buyout attempts from Sanofi ($SNY), which have been ongoing since March.

Despite being courted by half of Big Pharma this year, Medivation has had its setbacks in the clinic, namely around pidilizumab and the confusion over its mechanism of action.

The drug--which Medivation bought for $335 million deal in 2014 from CureTech--was designed as a PD-1 treatment, but recent studies showed that it could not actually work in this way, which saw the FDA temporarily halt the trial through a partial clinical hold while Medivation took another stab at explaining the mechanism of action.

In its Q2 update earlier this month, the biotech s CEO David Hung said the company was no closer to discovering just how this experimental med should work. This would mean that Dr. Peterson had not, in fact, technically been working on a PD-1 drug during her time at Medivation.

In a statement, Dr. Peterson said:  BeiGene has a robust pipeline of clinical stage, internally discovered molecules against validated targets as well as an expanding roster of candidates in the preclinical pipeline. I look forward to leveraging my past experiences to successfully build an organization that can bring these assets to market while continuing to expand the clinical pipeline. 

BeiGene s shares were down 4.8% at end of play yesterday, with a market cap just under $1 billion.

The NDA Amgen was seeking was for its candidate Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism (sHPT) with chronic kidney disease on hemodialysis.

In a very brief update, Amgen said the FDA has rejected it application in its current form, but gave no details as to whether this was due to concerns over safety, manufacturing of efficacy.

The nature of the letter, and especially if it required additional clinical trials, could seriously delay any approval of the med. Amgen said in a statement that it was  reviewing the Complete Response Letter, and we anticipate a post-action meeting with the FDA later this year to discuss the Complete Response. 

The FDA does not have to publicly declare the reason for its rejection, and companies can wait to make this information available. It filed the drug for U.S. review back in September, and in the same month with the EMA.

Amgen added that this wouldn t affect other regulatory submissions, but this may well depend on the issue or issues the FDA has found, and whether that will impact the drug s other reviews.

Parsabiv works as calcimimetic agent, a drug designed to mimic the action of calcium by activating the calcium-sensing receptors on the parathyroid gland. Parsabiv, which is given intravenously, binds to and activates the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland, decreasing PTH levels.

Amgen gained access to the drug four years ago as part of its $315 million acquisition of KAI Pharmaceuticals. In three Phase III trials posted last year, the drug met its primary goals by significantly reducing parathyroid hormone levels.

Amgen had hoped that its new med would supplant sales of its older treatment for the condition Sensipar (cinacalcet), which last year reached blockbuster sales. Analysts have previously suggested that Parsabiv could match Sensipar's sales at peak.

sHPT is a chronic and serious condition which, Amgen estimates, affects around 2 million people worldwide on dialysis, with about half a million of these in the U.S.","Pharmaceuticals"

Under the terms of the collab, which isn t disclosing any financial details, Cell Medica also gets an exclusive, worldwide option and license agreement for these technologies, as well as T cell receptor (TCR) gene sequences for the development and sale of specific products.

The deal will build on the research of Professor Hans Stauss and Professor Emma Morris of UCL, two big names in developing modified TCRs against oncology targets.

T cell receptors are molecules which sit on the surface of T cells. They work by recognizing antigens expressed by cancer cells.

What TCR technology does is to use this ability to target both intracellular and cell surface antigens, creating a mechanism to engineer immune cells to target certain tumors. UCL s tech, according to a joint statement, has the potential to  produce strong expression of TCRs by the engineered T cells,  which should boost its killing range when it comes to fighting tumors.

The University will carry out the preclinical and early clinical research under the auspices of a Joint Steering Committee.

Cell Medica said it will support the product development work with its  substantial experience in manufacturing clinical-grade cell therapies  while looking to also establish  robust production processes  suitable for industrial scale-up.

If and when a drug or drugs from the collab has finished up in Phase I, these treatments will then be handed over to Cell Medica for Phase II and beyond, including bringing them to market.

While not going into the exact figures, Cell Medica said has paid an up-front fee and  will make additional payments to exercise its exclusive option to license future products.  UCL, meanwhile, is eligible to receive further payments related to clinical, regulatory and sales milestones, as well as single digit royalties.

Gregg Sando, CEO of Cell Medica said:  This collaboration adds the modified TCR technology platform to our strategy to develop breakthrough treatments for cancer using cellular immunotherapy products. The partnership with Profs Hans Stauss and Emma Morris, leading researchers in this field, should enable us to generate a pipeline of new TCR products with increased efficacy and safety for patients. 

Cell Medica, one of last year s Fierce 15, also has an ongoing pact with Houston s Baylor College of Medicine to find and develop next-gen tech for engineering immune cells in tumors.

In June they signed an expanded deal to apply CAR technology to natural killer T (NKT) cells as a novel immune cell type with biological properties that may be particularly effective for targeting solid tumors.

The Belgian cell therapy biotech has been seen as a possible IPO candidate for a couple of years, but the chatter is now reportedly turning into action.

Mont-Saint-Guibert, Belgium-based Promethera is looking to raise up to  40 million ($45 million), L Echo reports, to finance its pipeline plans. Promethera s lead candidate, HepaStem, is a formulation of allogeneic human adult liver-derived progenitor cells. The cells are extracted from donor livers, processed and reconstituted for injection, resulting in a candidate Promethera thinks can treat a variety of liver diseases.

Promethera has tested the drug most extensively in patients with the rare disease urea cycle disorder (UCD). A Phase I/II trial in that indication is ongoing. Raising  30 million to  40 million in an IPO would give Promethera the financial means to continue to advance in UCD, while also freeing it up to expand its ambitions. The biotech, particularly since John Tchelingerian took over as CEO last year, has expressed a desire to go after bigger indications than UCD.

Preclinical testing of HepaStem against acute-on-chronic liver failure and acute alcoholic hepatitis is underway. Promethera is also exploring the use of HepaStem as a treatment for hemophilia, fibrosis and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH). None of these projects have advanced beyond very early, exploratory testing, but are potentially lucrative opportunities. The challenge for Promethera will be to persuade investors to buy into the idea that one or more of these long shots can pay off.

Investors seeking reasons to be cautious won t have to look far from Promethera s headquarters. Fellow cell therapy specialist Celyad ($CYAD) is based a few minutes drive from Promethera. Celyad had accrued far more clinical data than Promethera at the time of its Nasdaq IPO, but that didn t stop it from later failing a Phase III trial. Investors who backed Celyad at the time of the Nasdaq IPO now find themselves down 54%.

While the jury is still out on whether Promethera or Celyad will ever deliver for investors or patients, the presence of both of them on public markets would represent a significant moment for a corner of Belgium. With the Mont-Saint-Guibert-based pair being 30 minutes by car from Bone Therapeutics (EBR:BOTHE), the region could soon be home to three publicly-traded cell therapy biotechs, making it something of a hotspot for the technology.","Pharmaceuticals"

The new report has added in May, a Government Accountability Office report called for a solution to the matter of faulty risk scores, and that at least half a dozen industry insiders have filed whistleblower lawsuits regarding manipulation of risk scores.

Some of the insurers found to have overcharged the government -- none of which provided comment to the CPI -- included five Humana plans, three UnitedHealth plans and four Wellpoint plans. The two plans found to have no net overpayments were Group Health Cooperative in Washington state and a Kaiser Foundation Health Plan in California.

The overpayments for unsupported medical diagnoses exceeded $10,000 per patient for more than 150 patients across the 37 audits, the researchers found, adding the health plans overcharged by $2,000 or more per patient for at least 3,500 people in the sample.

In another key finding, auditors found health plans three times more likely to charge Medicare too much than too little for certain medical conditions examined under the audits.

Meanwhile, Medicare Advantage plans have long challenged the RADV audit process, with Clare Krusing of America's Health Insurance Plans calling it ""not yet stable and reliable"" and arguing CMS doesn't allow health plans to submit additional supporting data regarding patients' conditions.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

","http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/medical-tourism-growing-but-obstacles-hamper-trend-in-us-hospitals/425343/","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 16:38:01 -0400","NA","Medical tourism growing, but obstacles hamper trend in U.S. hospitalsMedical tourism growing, but obstacles hamper trend in U.S. hospitals

More people are traveling abroad for medical procedures, often with the blessing of both their employer and insurance carrier. According to a recent report by Visa and Oxford Economics, the global medical tourism market totaled $439 billion in 2015 and will grow 25% annually over the next decade. That figure was subsequently revised downward to $50 billion, the International Medical Travel Journal notes, but it is still a significant market. Driving this trend are increasing access to high-quality care and services outside the U.S., lower costs, the chance to couple treatments with attractive destinations and availability of treatments and drugs not approved or available stateside.

While cost is just one reason people travel for care, it can be a compelling one if the foreign provider is reputable. Consider a knee replacement, for example. The procedure can cost anywhere from $35,000 to $60,000 in the U.S., but costs less than $23,000 in Costa Rica or India, according to The Fiscal Times. The most common procedures people travel for are heart surgery, cosmetic surgery and dentistry.

While the majority of medical tourists flock to the U.S. for care, Thailand, Singapore, German, South Korea and Spain are fast catching up, the report says. India is also a major destination for medical tourism, particularly for cardiac care. Understanding these travel patterns and the opportunities for attracting patients can provide a valuable added revenue stream for hospitals that position themselves in this market.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that up to 750,000 U.S. residents travel abroad each year for medical care, a mere drop in the bucket compared with the nearly 37 million patient discharges from U.S. hospitals reported in 2011.

One might expect that states like Washington, which abuts British Columbia, would see substantial numbers of individuals crossing the border north for medical procedures. But Mary Kay Clunies-Ross, spokesman for the Washington State Hospital Association, says she hasn t seen any significant impact on local hospitals.

 Some of our hospitals do get international patients, but that is usually in the context of seeking needed services from a specific program or provider (e.g., they might come to be treated at Fred Hutchison Cancer Research, or bring a child to Seattle Children s Hospital for pediatric specialty care),  she writes in an email.  I don t know of any international marketing campaign. 

Most U.S. hospitals haven t figured out that medical tourism could be a revenue diversification strategy, and they re too mired in the Affordable Care Act, PCORI reporting, managed care contracting and other obligations to promote themselves as a specialty surgery or magnet hospital destination, says Maria K. Todd, CEO of Mercury Advisory Group in Denver, CO, and an international consultant on healthcare business development.  They just don t have the bandwidth to figure out how to do the marketing campaign and study the market and still do everything else they have to do. 

Todd, who wrote ""Handbook of Medical Tourism and Program Development,"" sees two categories of U.S. hospitals taking advantage of the travel-to-care trend: Academic medical centers (AMCs) and ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs). AMCs have excess capacity and some of the latest research and technology, but they need cases on which to train new doctors. Medicare alone doesn t cover the cost of all of that training. As a result, many AMCs are using medical tourism as a diversification strategy to get different reimbursement sources into the mix,  Todd tells Healthcare Dive.

ASCs, on the other hand, are usually selling to price-sensitive customers, Todd says. She points to ASCs in rural areas that are looking for ways to compete with critical care hospitals. The federal government allows CAHs to charge 101% of what Medicare would pay a non-critical access hospital, so an ASC that s outfitted for overnight beds and can cut the cost of a procedure, and is located near a moderate-priced motel, can bundle together a price-driven medical tourism package and market it to the public.

Hospitals interested in creating a medical tourism revenue stream should build on what the facility already does well, such as hip replacements or cardiac artery bypass grafts, rather than add a service line or new staff, Todd says. Other critical factors include brand identification and destination.

 What doctors have not understood in America is how to brand themselves   and so it would be very hard for them to claim a medical tourism base, let s say, in comparison with a doctor who s a researcher who s published at the Cleveland Clinic,  she says.  Brand in healthcare translates to trust   and people want to trust that where they get their healthcare is the best choice they could have made. 

Another thing holding hospitals back is determining case rate, says Todd. With CMS  bundled case rate initiative, hospitals are having to learn how to bundle cases and that requires knowing the cost. But medical tourism is not a fee-for-service, line item percent of charges;  It s 100% give me an estimate up front,  she explains. The only way to do that well is to define a case rate with contingency for outliers for example, the rate for a stent procedure would cover three stents and any additional stents would cost $1,500 each.

 With hospitals not knowing their case rates, you can t do transparent quoting,  says Todd, who likens the situation to asking a grocer for the price of a loaf of bread and then waiting while somebody does a price check.

 The American population demands, if I m going to fly to you, you need to tell me is this going to cost $7,000 or $17,000, and most American facilities are not prepared to do that on anything more than maybe a hip or a knee [replacement] or a lap band,  she says.  They re not prepared for contingencies  such as an allergy to an anesthetic that could put the patient in intensive care.

For patients who do choose to travel for care, whether abroad or within the U.S., there s another thing to consider. Under the CPT code system, Medicare will pay for 90 days of post-operative care at no additional charge. That s already bundled into the CPT code. But that could be a problem if the patient leaves the city where the procedure was done after a week or 10 days. That leaves the patient s hometown doctor to provide the other 80 days of follow-up care, and some doctors are refusing to take patients back, according to Todd.

 Some of it is about greed, taking food off my table,  she says, noting the hometown doctor can only bill for evaluation and management, not the procedure itself. Physicians are also concerned that they could be blamed   and sued   for a complication they didn t cause. With medical complications coverage at one of the leading medical travel insurance programs capped at $50,000, that s far below the roughly $250,000 malpractice tort liability ceiling in most of the U.S., Todd says.

 You can blow through $50,000 on a case gone bad in no time flat,  she adds.  So if [people] go out of the country and they have a complication, yes, that complication insurance might kick in, but they might still charge the local doctor with the complication. ","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

Seniors are financially impacted by surprise medical bills more so than Medicare when it comes to observation care because it can lead to higher out-of-pocket expenses since its considered an outpatient service.

As noted by California Healthline, patients receiving observation services may sometimes have to pay more for treatments and tests than admitted patients, adding that Medicare does not cover the costs of follow-ups in nursing homes after staying for fewer days than the required minimum of three days in a row when admitted.

Other states have passed laws similar to California's legislation such as Florida and New York. But the issue of whether providers should bill patient in-network rates or insurers should cover the extra costs is still under debate.

The report makes an interesting companion alongside HHS' recent assertion that the ""overwhelming majority"" of HealthCare.gov consumers will still be able to buy coverage for less than $75 per month, just as in 2016, through the use of premium tax credits and shopping around. This is because it seems to assume the ""overwhelming majority"" will have choices.

","http://www.healthcaredive.com/news/hipaa-at-20-looking-back-at-two-decades-of-patient-privacy-protections/425378/","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 06:56:59 -0400","NA","HIPAA at 20: Looking back at two decades of patient privacy protectionsHIPAA at 20: Looking back at two decades of patient privacy protections

More than two decades ago, on August 21, 1996, then-President Bill Clinton signed the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) into law. Since then, healthcare has changed a lot and HIPAA has helped guide those changes every step of the way.

Although HIPAA was passed in 1996, it would take nearly seven years for the initial HIPAA Privacy Rule to go into effect. As the first federal law to address the privacy and security of health information, the HIPAA Privacy Rule was inherently complex. Privacy provisions in the original legislation signed by President Clinton totaled 337 words. The final rule issued in March 2002 was around 101,000 words long and spanned more than 500 pages, according to an October 2003 USA Today article.

 When the HIPAA regulation initially went into effect, it generated significant skepticism, confusion, and even angst,  Jocelyn Samuels, director of the HHS' Office for Civil Rights (OCR), told Healthcare Dive.

Criticism of HIPAA came from all directions, Samuels said. On one side, healthcare providers wondered whether HIPAA might prove to be too cumbersome and expensive to comply with. On the other, patient advocates expressed concern that HIPAA wouldn t provide meaningful protections.

In the early years of HIPAA privacy protections, HHS and OCR, which was responsible for enforcing the Privacy Rule, seemed content to let noncompliant healthcare providers slide with a warning. From April 2003 to 2008, around 35,000 HIPAA privacy violations were reported, but not a single civil fine was levied against a healthcare provider.

HHS said it had worked with around 6,000 providers reported for violations to help them achieve  voluntary compliance,  according to an April 2008 article in the Wall Street Journal. Their approach was to encourage  improvements that were constructive and were achieved more quickly than through imposition of monetary penalties.  This approach would change with the passage of the HITECH Act in 2009.

In many ways, HIPAA was ahead of its time. Although it passed before widespread adoption of EHRs, HIPAA recognized in 1996 that digitization of health data was right around the corner. One of its goals was to standardize the electronic exchange of sensitive health information. HIPAA laid the groundwork for future efforts to advance health IT and those efforts, in turn, strengthened HIPAA s privacy protections.

 HIPAA has transformed healthcare and healthcare delivery over the past two decades, evolving itself alongside of technology,  Samuels said.  The HIPAA standards have helped pave the way for the widespread adoption of the electronic health record and the interoperability of health data. 

When the HITECH Act passed in 2009, it included provisions to strengthen HIPAA privacy protections and HHS  ability to enforce them. The HITECH Act expanded compliance requirements to business associates of covered entities, required self-reporting of privacy breaches, and increased potential fines for violations to up to $1.5 million. Later that year, OCR would issue the first of many multi-million dollar fines for HIPAA violations.

HITECH changes to HIPAA were finalized in January 2013 with the release of the HIPAA/HITECH Omnibus Final Rule.  The final omnibus rule marks the most sweeping changes to the HIPAA Privacy and Security Rules since they were first implemented,  then-OCR Director Leon Rodriguez said.

While patients are technically afforded the right under HIPAA to access their own personal health information, this is easier said than done.  Far too often individuals face obstacles to accessing their health information, even from entities required to comply with the HIPAA Privacy Rule,  Samuels wrote in a January blog post.

By accessing their own personal health information, patients could better manage chronic health conditions and help to coordinate their care. While HIPAA makes this a possibility in theory, it is much more difficult in practice.

Even worse, third parties often have more access to personal health information than patients themselves. Anonymized health data may be doled out for research purposes that do indeed help patients, but it can also be used for marketing and other commercial practices. In May 2014, the Federal Trade Commission issued a report showing how much personal health information data brokers are collecting.

Supposedly anonymized health data can also be used to connect medical records to the individuals to which they belong. In 2005, Carnegie Mellon University Professor Latanya Sweeney told the Privacy and Integrity Advisory Committee of the Department of Homeland Security that she was able to compare hospital data to voter registration rolls to identify medical records belonging to former Massachusetts Governor William Weld.

 The public has been misled and most still have no knowledge of their lack of control over their sensitive health data,  Dr. Deborah Peel, founder and president of Patient Privacy Rights, told Healthcare Dive.  Today, no nation has a comprehensive map of all flows of personal health data. How can personal data possibly be secured, much less private, if we have no idea where it is or how it s used? 

HIPAA is an imperfect law, but, at 20 years old, it could mature and grow stronger. As OCR Director Samuels said, HIPAA has been a blue print for healthcare reform. At this point, it will likely be a mainstay in blue prints for healthcare reforms of the future.","Medical Devices and Diagnostics"

The analysis revealed that there is a gap in depression treatment and the treatment is more often than not unnecessary. If these issues were to be addressed, it could lead to healthier patient populations.

The researchers analyzed 2012 and 2013 data on 46,417 adults from Medical Expenditure Panel Surveys. About 8.1% of the surveyed adults reported they had been receiving depression treatment but just 29.9% of them had screened positive. Inversely, among the 8.4% that screened positive, only 28.7% received treatment.

""I was actually somewhat surprised,"" study author Dr. Mark Olfson, professor of psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, told CNN. ""There has been a substantial increase in prescribing antidepressants over the last several years, and so I think it is tempting to assume that under-treatment of depression is no longer a big deal.""

According to Olfson, there are several reasons why patients may not want to be treated for depression such as the negative stigma associated with it or other medical conditions that may cause patient to overlook symptoms.

Findings show the most common treatment the surveyed adults were given was antidepressants (87%), followed by psychotherapy (23.2%), anxiolytics (13.5%), antipsychotics (7.0%), and mood stabilizers (5.1%). Olfson recommends integrating screening tools and mental health services into primary care to address the disparities in access to depression treatment as well as awareness of the condition, Kaiser Health News reported.

Dr. Uwe Reinhardt, a Princeton health policy researcher and professor, recently pontificated on the exchanges' troubles saying, ""It is hard to see a way out of this dilemma, given the current political climate.""

While the exchanges are in trouble (Vox recently predicted a spike in the number of counties where there is only one choice, from 182 in 2016 to 687 in 2017), that doesn't necessarily mean the ACA as a whole is failing (20 million individuals did receive health coverage through the law). However, CMS is playing the long game and working hard to stabilize and strengthen the market. For example, the agency earlier this month asked for public comment on concerns raised about providers and other organizations directing Medicare or Medicaid-eligible people toward individual market plans, including marketplace plans.

""Right now, we are preparing to serve millions of consumers with a new set of innovations during the upcoming Marketplace Open Enrollment,"" CMS' acting Administrator Andy Slavitt said in a prepared statement. ""As we do this, we are proposing...a set of critical actions based upon our first three years' experience that, if finalized, would improve how consumers and health plans interact with the Marketplace.""

Beginning in 2018, the rule proposes to establish transfers to help spread the risk of high-cost enrollees to help improve risk adjustment policies. In addition to the risk adjustment proposals, CMS is hoping to improve the consumer experience by giving individuals additional tools to assess competing plans.

""The proposed rule would also create multiple child age bands that address instances in which consumers could face large premium changes after turning age 21; amend the guaranteed renewability regulations to provide additional flexibility for issuers to remain in an insurance market in certain situations; and codify several special enrollment periods that are already available to consumers in order to ensure the rules are clear and to limit abuse,"" the agency noted.

Still, the green light continues the positive signaling from the agency on continued development of biosimilar drugs.

While biosimilars are more common in Europe, the U.S. was slow to adopt a regulatory structure to permit approval for copies of biologic drugs, which are more complex than traditional small molecule treatments.

Erelzi is the second biosimilar successfully developed by Novartis' Sandoz unit, which hopes to launch five biosimilars of major cancer and immunology drugs by 2020. Sandoz, the generics arm of the Swiss pharma giant, also won approval for a copy of Amgen's Neupogen last year.

The European Medicines Agency is reviewing an application for approval of Novartis biosimilar entanercept in European markets, Novartis said.

Regulators in the U.S. approved Erelzi specifically as a biosimilar rather than as an ""interchangeable product."" This means the drug is highly similar to its reference product (Enbrel) with no clinically meaningful differences. Approval as an interchangeable would indicate Erelzi is expected to produce the same clinical result as Enbrel in any given patient.

While the distinction between the two categories appears to be a case of splitting hairs, classification as an interchangeable would allow pharmacists to make substitutions between the branded drug and the biosimilar, much as they do for generic copies of pharmaceuticals.

So far none of the three biosimilars okayed by the FDA have been classified as an interchangeable.

Erelzi will be allowed for use in patients with moderate to severe rheumatoid arthritis, moderate to severe polyarticular juvenile idiopathic arthritis, psoriatic arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis and moderate to severe plaque psoriasis. The drug will also carry a boxed warning cautioning against the risk of serious infections, such as tuberculosis and invasive fungal infections.

Novartis hopes to wrest some of Enbrel s revenues, which last year totaled roughly $5.4 billion, away from Amgen. While the other two biosimilars, Zarxio and Inflectra, have so far had only modest launches, Erelzi represents a significant threat to Amgen. Sales of Enbrel account for about 25% of the company s total sales.

Interestingly, Amgen is playing both offense and defense in the race to develop biosimilar versions of top-selling biologic drugs. Even as the drugmaker attempted to fend Novarts  efforts to market biosimilar Enbrel, Amgen was developing a biosimilar version of AbbVie's Humira. That biosimilar won the backing of an FDA advisory panel the same week as Novartis' biosimilar Enbrel

Generic drugmakers have typically operated as distinct from their branded counterparts, although the lines have blurred in recent lines. By contrast, biosimilar development in the U.S. has been led by big pharma companies such as Novartis, Pfizer and Amgen.","Healthcare"

However, according to the United States Department of Commerce, between 2008 and 2012, Alcon Pharmaceuticals sent medical devices and equipment to Iran via other countries, at a value of over $8.1 million. There were also re-exports to Syria around the same time, worth almost $73,000.

Alcon Labs, on the other hand, apparently shipped medical devices and equipment to Iran over 40 times, totaling over $3.6 million in value.

As a result of these, and of other exports to Sudan, Alcon Labs and Alcon Pharmaceuticals will have to pay a civil penalty of more than $16 million to the U.S. government.

The Department of Commerce noted in its order, Alcon Labs was aware of the  long-standing and well-known US embargo against Iran , especially as the company had always applied for and received previous licenses for exporting goods to Iran.

While companies such as Novo Nordisk are expanding into Iran and making the most of new markets as sanctions begin to lift, Alcon (rather expensively) seems to have taken its eye off the ball here.

J.P. Morgan analysts said in a note to clients they had been expecting a response rate in the mid-20% range, a notch higher than the 18% result seen. Previously reported Phase 2 results in a much smaller trial showed almost half of patients responding to therapy. J.P. Morgan's Anupam Rama called the results a ""grind it out win"" instead of ""home run,"" but noted the lack of a placebo response de-risked the drug a bit.

""We believe that fostamatinib has significant commercial potential given that it has a unique mechanism of action that may work where other products have failed,"" said Rigel President and CEO Raul Rodriguez in a statement.

The goal of the study was to raise patient platelet counts above 50,000/uL. Among those who met the primary endpoint, patient platelet counts rose by a median increase of 16,0000/uL to more than 100,000/uL at 24 weeks. All of the patients who met the primary endpoint have continued on the therapy and maintained the positive results.

ITP is an autoimmune disease in which the patient's immune system attacks and destroys platelets in the blood, which are needed for clotting and healing.

While Rodriguez is touting the therapy's potential, it might take more data for others to agree. The company was previously partnered with British pharma AstraZeneca, but the deal fell through in 2013 when fostamatinib failed in a trial for rheumatoid arthritis.

Another failure in asthma prompted Rigel to shift gears and focus on smaller patient populations instead of large disease categories.","Healthcare"

Flutiform is a combination of corticosteroid and a LABA. Roughly 1,800 patients were randomized to take either a low or high dose of flutiform or formoterol fumarate dihydrate over the course of one year.

Patients who received flutiform did not see any superior reduction in annualized rates of moderate and severe COPD exacerbation, however.

""Whilst this result is disappointing, flutiform continues to grow strongly based on the approved asthma indication, which continues to underpin our expectations for future growth of the product,"" said James Ward-Lilley, CEO of Vectura.

Net sales of flutiform for its asthma indication have grown quickly, doubling to  144 million in 2015, mostly in the E.U. and Japan. Kyorin sells the drug in Japan while Mundipharma is responsible for marketing in Europe.

Most of the drugs for the treatment of COPD are combination products that include a corticosteroid and either a LABA or long-acting muscarinic antagoinist (LAMA). Many companies in the space have also been testing treatments that are a combination of LAMA/LABA, which is becoming the preferred treatment option. AstraZeneca gained approval of their COPD combo Bevespi Aerosphere in April. Meanwhile, several big setbacks have been seen in the space for steroid-LABA combinations, making COPD a tricky market to gain a foothold.","Healthcare"

AOC had pushed to remove both Abend and the former vice chairman Oetker, proposing a number of its own candidates. While Eric Cornut, a former chief ethics officer at Novartis supported by AOC, was selected to join the nine-member supervisory board, shareholders decided to elect Oetker as the new chairman.

Motions by AOC against two of the supervisory board's proposed candidates also failed, according to a statements from Stada.

Newly elected chairman Oetker obliquely referenced AOC's challenge to the status quo at Stada in a press release following the vote: ""We agree on progressing consistently on the path of renewal in the interest of the company to the right extent and at an appropriate pace. A key part of our work will be the constructive dialogue with all shareholder groups.""

AOC has a 5.05% share of voting rights in Stada, although if financial instruments are included its stake rises to just under 7%.

In in its latest response, Mylan will launch a generic version of EpiPen, which will be identical to the original branded product. The company indicated the generic copy will be released on the market in several weeks after completion of labeling revisions.

Last week, Bresch made several comments on CNBC which deflected blame from Mylan and criticized the overall healthcare system, drawing the ire of the industry:

""That $608 is a list price. What Mylan takes from that, our net sales is $274. So $137 per pen.

Now, in direct response to the continued criticism, Mylan will be offering a generic version of EpiPen via direct-mail, cutting out pharmacies.

""Our decision to launch a generic alternative to EpiPen is an extraordinary commercial response, which required the cooperation of our partner,"" said Bresch in a statement on August 29.

""However, because of the complexity and opaqueness of today's branded pharmaceutical supply chain and the increased shifting of costs to patients as a result of high deductible health plans, we determined that bypassing the brand system in this case and offering an additional alternative was the best option,"" she added.

Mylan intends to continue offering the cost-savings and discount programs associated with the branded version of the drug.

""Mylan also continues to fight for enhanced access to epinephrine auto-injectors through other measures, such as inclusion of the product on the federal and private insurance preventive drug lists, which could potentially eliminate all co-pays,"" the company wrote in the statement.

The controversy over EpiPen came to a head last week when Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton released a statement about the product, calling for a lower price. This was compounded by letters from several members of Congress demanding Mylan explain the price increases.

EpiPen is an epinephrine auto-injector that is used in emergency situations. The product counters anaphylactic shock caused by allergic reactions, such as those triggered by certain foods or bee stings.","Healthcare"

Erelzi is the second biosimilar from Sandoz approved in the United States through the FDA biosimilars pathway established under the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act.

""We continue to increase patient access to key treatment options by expanding our offering of biosimilars which helps to reduce costs within the healthcare system"" said Carol Lynch, Global Head Biopharmaceuticals, Sandoz.

""Sandoz is proud to have developed two of the three biosimilars that are currently FDA approved, which further demonstrates our commitment to US patients in a growing number of therapeutic areas. We are committed to bringing Erelzi to the US market as soon as possible"".

The FDA approval follows a unanimous vote (20-0) by the FDA's Arthritis Advisory Committee (AAC) in July to recommend use in all indications of the reference product. The approval is based on a comprehensive package of analytical, nonclinical, and clinical data confirming that Erelzi is highly similar to the US-licensed reference product. Clinical studies included four comparative pharmacokinetic (PK) studies in 216 healthy volunteers and a confirmatory efficacy and safety similarity study in 531 patients with chronic plaque psoriasis. Extrapolation to all indications approved for use on the reference product label is on the basis that the Sandoz biosimilar etanercept and the reference product are essentially the same.

An application for Sandoz biosimilar etanercept has been accepted by the European Medicines Agency (Q4 2015) and is currently undergoing review.

There is tremendous need for additional therapeutic options for patients with advanced mutant BRCA ovarian cancer and we look forward to cooperating with FDA on the rucaparib NDA review. 

 Recurrent ovarian cancer remains a very difficult disease to treat, even among women who carry, or whose tumors have a mutation in the BRCA genes. Despite the available treatment options, few effective therapies are at our disposal. Thus, the opportunity to treat women with germline or somatic BRCA mutations with rucaparib after two prior lines of platinum-based therapy, represents a meaningful step forward for our patients,  said Robert L. Coleman, MD, Professor & Deputy Chairman, Vice Chair, Clinical Research, Ann Rife Cox Chair in Gynecology, Department of Gynecologic Oncology and Reproductive Medicine at University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.","Biotechnology"

"Pharma s Role in Pediatric Medication Adherence","The pharmaceutical industry is well positioned to improve adherence by focusing on formulations, simplified dosing regimens and packaging improvements.","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/pharmas-role-in-pediatric-medication-adherence/","Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:39:00 -0400","NA","Pharma s Role in Pediatric Medication AdherenceThough medication non-adherence has been discussed with growing interest for several decades, the topic remains an important focus of the pharmaceutical industry. In 2012, it is estimated that 8% of the total healthcare spending in the United States   more than $200 billion   was spent on improper or unnecessary use of medications.1 Though many different patient subsets continue to be affected by poor adherence, children present a unique challenge.

Children remain a distinct challenge because of their fluctuating development, as well as the variable number of caregivers and treatment locations that may be involved.2 In the United States alone, more than 200,000 out-of-hospital medication errors per year have been reported to the National Poison Data System (NPDS), the American Association of Poison Control Centers  (AAPCC) proprietary database since 2003. Approximately 30% of those reports have involved children 6 years of age or younger.3

Improving medication adherence requires the active participation of all involved parties. The pharmaceutical industry is well positioned to enact change at this level by focusing on formulations, simplified dosing regimens and packaging improvements to enhance caregiver convenience and understanding.

Children and adolescents are often physically limited in their ability to ingest larger solid dose medications, which has led pharmaceutical manufacturers to consider alternate forms of administration; different or limited taste preferences also pose a challenge.2 Syrups and suspensions offer greater flexibility, as a dose can be adjusted to account for weight or flavored for taste. However, both are also difficult to measure, easy to spill if a child is resistant, and offer little in the way of tracking from one dose to the next. Ensuring that accurate dosing cups, spoons, oral syringes, or droppers are provided can help to improve accuracy and eliminate the use of household measuring devices (e.g. teaspoons).

Of the medication errors documented in the NPDS from 2002-2012, over 80% involved liquid medications.3 Additionally, 20% of all dosing errors were categorized as the result of an accidental double dose.3 Offering multiple dosing options   tablets/capsules, chewables, granules and/or injectables, along with suspensions and syrups, can help to minimize many of the issues associated with liquid dosing; but dose size and accuracy are only part of the challenge.

The physiological differences in children may make certain excipients unsuitable for pediatric consumption, presenting an entirely different set of challenges for pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical manufacturers.2,4 A child s size changes dramatically   an increase of up to 1900% during growth; the dose increase that should correspond with this may approach 100-fold.4 This leads to significant pharmacokinetic differences in young children, including drug metabolism, transport expression, renal clearance, gastrointestinal permeability, and drug absorption (based on surface area).4 With many of these differences constantly in flux, it can be difficult to ensure that a given medication will meet toxicity and excipient requirements. Thoroughly understanding pharmacokinetic impact on pediatric patients is important, but pediatric drug testing adds to development costs and has only recently started to increase.

The pharmaceutical industry has historically viewed the pediatric market segment as only offering small financial benefits.5 To further complicate the issue, studies conducted on children present unique challenges related to both informed consent   with children 7 years of age and older being allowed to independently assent or dissent   and challenges with even the most routine procedures, including blood draws and urine samples.5 However, FDA regulations are working to increase pediatric studies to benefit patients and pharmaceutical companies alike. Though these studies place added responsibility on manufacturers, they help clinicians make more informed decisions, offering caregivers additional peace of mind.

In particular, the voluntary Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act (BPCA) has been significant, potentially offering six months of additional marketing exclusivity on drugs in pediatric studies, as well as all additional forms / formulations containing the same active-ingredient moiety.5 Both pharmaceutical companies and the FDA can initiate a pediatric trial under BPCA, but the FDA ultimately determines the potential pediatric health benefits of the drug. However, after voluntary measures in the 1990s failed to produce results, the FDA became aware of the need for mandatory research in addition to voluntary programs and, as a result, the Pediatric Research Equity Act (PREA) was signed into law in 2003. PREA aims to protect pediatric patients by allowing the FDA to require pediatric studies on both pharmaceuticals and biopharmaceuticals if it believes the substance will likely be used in a pediatric setting or could provide benefits in such a setting.5

Following trials, one of the most significant ways pharmaceutical manufactures can help combat non-adherence is through improvements to both primary and secondary packaging. According to the 2016 Nice Insight CDMO Outsourcing Survey, many manufacturers are already turning to manufacturing partners for solutions in this area; compliance and adherence solutions were outsourced by 42% of respondents, while 39% outsourced child resistant and compliance prompting packaging.6","Biotechnology"
"Convenience in Drug Delivery Drives Complexity and Greater Oversight of Evolving Packaging Systems","With Pharma EXPO just two months away, Pharmaceutical Manufacturing discusses the challenges of today's quickly changing packaging systems with Jerry Martin, pharmaceutical and life sciences consultant to PMMI, The Association of Packaging and Processing Technologies.","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/convenience-in-drug-delivery-drives-complexity-and-greater-oversight-of-evolving-packaging-systems/","Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:30:00 -0400","NA","Convenience in Drug Delivery Drives Complexity and Greater Oversight of Evolving Packaging SystemsWhat are the major challenges that pharmaceutical end users experience with their packaging systems?

There are a couple of significant challenges that pharmaceutical manufacturers may experience in selecting and implementing packaging systems. One of these challenges is posed by the growing trend toward prefilled syringes for liquid injectables. Prefilled syringes offer a much higher degree of performance than traditional vials by eliminating the dosage preparation necessary at the hospital. However, the implementation of prefilled syringes expands the validation process for the drug manufacturer.



Another challenge stems from the new standard on the qualification of materials for packaging systems with regard to extractables and leachables. Chemicals that can migrate out of the packaging materials and into the dosage form are a concern. With advancing analytics technology, there is a push from the FDA to understand what risks are posed by packaging ingredient migration. U.S. Pharmaceutical Convention (USP) is actively working on revising its standards for qualifying plastic packaging materials from the raw material to the final format. It's in the process of being finalized and it will be helpful for the industry to follow those standards. The goal is to establish standard evaluation methods and eventually, threshold limits, out of a consensus of experts.

Can you elaborate more on the revision of standards by the USP?

USP has formed an expert committee of volunteers from different reaches of the pharmaceutical and biotech sectors   including testing laboratories, drug manufacturers and component or equipment suppliers   to assess the risks and establish an updated, standardized approach to qualifying materials and packaging systems. The first two new standards published late last year addressed the qualification of component materials and final containers made from those materials. The next standards will address the process equipment side   upstream of filling the final packaging. These are currently in draft form and will be finalized by the end of this year. The next step, slated for 2017, is to generate standards for the suitability of packaging in the final dosage form.

When will drug manufacturers be expected to comply with these new standards?

No deadlines are set for compliance. These standards are voluntary. The USP sets the reference standards for the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Therefore, pharmaceutical manufacturers that follow the USP standards will not have to go through any extra steps to meet FDA approval. However, pharmaceutical manufacturers that opt not to abide by USP standards will be held accountable by the FDA to provide other proof that the methods of analysis utilized are at least as effective. The USP's guidelines are treated as expectations. If an FDA reviewer questions a practice that complies with USP standards, pharmaceutical manufacturers have a strong scientific basis to stand on.

At this particular juncture in time, what is driving the need for these new USP standards?

Packaging systems are becoming more and more complex. I recently read about a biological that is packaged in an automatically timed, self-injection device that patients can wear on their stomachs. When a packaging system was just a vial in a box, there were far fewer components to evaluate. We're moving into a domain where the drug and the device are a package deal, but assessed by different teams at the FDA. The trend toward more complex delivery systems just doesn't always fit into the organizational structure of that agency. The FDA addressed this through the Office of Combination Products and new guidance. Creating a standardized set of expectations will make oversight of these increasingly complex packaging systems easier for all parties.

How has this trend toward complex packaging systems affected the general supply chain?

Pharmaceutical manufacturers certainly want to ensure that drugs, especially biologicals, are kept at the right temperature through the course of the supply chain. While we haven't seen many instances where temperature control of the drug has compromised the delivery device, temperature control is becoming more sophisticated with tracers that monitor the temperature and maintaining it through electronic signal so that the operators detect any deviation before the product goes bad. The added complexity is bound to necessitate greater utilization of the Internet of Things (IoT) to provide a higher sense of security and environmental control. These methods are being investigated now. On the topic of track-and-trace, sophisticated monitoring devices can help serve to authenticate original products when the threat of counterfeits loom over a drug.

For manufacturers within the pharmaceutical and biotech industries, Pharma EXPO (November 6-9; McCormick Place, Chicago, Illinois) will be a resource for insights and solutions on equipment and material solutions to adhere to new USP standards. Co-located with PACK EXPO International, Pharma EXPO is co-produced by PMMI, The Association for Packaging and Processing Technologies and ISPE, the International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineering. Together, the two shows will serve as the largest resource for processing and packaging innovation in North America.","Biotechnology"
"Lean and Mean: How Does Your Supply Chain Shape Up?","Up to half the cost of many supply chains lurks ignored and unmanaged; much of that cost can be eliminated by applying lean manufacturing techniques.","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/articles/2016/lean-and-mean-how-does-your-supply-chain-shape-up/","Wed, 24 Aug 2016 09:10:00 -0400","NA","Lean and Mean: How Does Your Supply Chain Shape Up?For all the effort and ingenuity that pharma companies are putting into streamlining sales and operations planning, inventory management and logistics, major opportunities remain in the outbound supply chain, from packaging to delivery.

The typical pharma company operates a historically grown network with one or many warehouses in each country, different contracting terms and diverse transportation companies. Pharma logistics represent about 2 percent of sales, or 7-8 percent of the cost of goods sold, less than what we find in other industries (see Exhibit 1), and the outbound supply chain is often outsourced.

Under these circumstances, optimizing outbound logistics has not been a strategic priority for pharma companies. We think it should be   especially in light of current industry cost and performance pressures. Distribution is the logistical interface with the customer. Inefficient or unreliable warehouse operations and transportation cost more than money   delivery delays can do quick and lasting damage to a company's reputation.

Companies have made significant improvements to manufacturing, service and maintenance operations through lean techniques: eliminating waste, inflexibility and variability in their systems and reducing costs by up to 50 percent in the process. Yet few apply the same lean techniques in warehouse operations or transportation, even though they can have a dramatic effect. These operations represent 95 percent of the pharma logistics costs and, in our experience, companies can save 20-50 percent in warehousing and up to 40 percent in transportation.

Companies that have run successful lean programs not only save money in warehouse operations, but also enjoy more flexibility and much better service, without significant capital investment. Companies that focus on transportation cost drivers gain on two fronts: they can control cost overruns or reduce current costs, and they can improve customer service and satisfaction by tailoring services, such as lead times and delivery frequencies, to customer needs.

The first challenge in optimizing warehouse operations is that there is no ""standard""   they tend to be as diverse as the products they store. A multi-client facility, for example, with a huge number of SKUs and diverse inventory turnover, looks vastly different from a small-volume operation with a few SKUs. As a consequence, it has been difficult to identify best practices or apply them across a broad variety of settings. Warehouse managers struggle with special circumstances as they try to improve lackluster performance.

We have developed a comprehensive approach to performance measurement across all types of warehouse, providing supply chain managers with a tool to rate warehouse efficiency. We begin by calculating the clean-sheet cost, space and capital that an ""ideal"" warehouse would need to handle the given volume. We then adjust for site-specific circumstances, such as multiple floors and high labor costs. We add logistic service provider margins if the warehouse is outsourced. The results reveal the warehouse's theoretical and realistic performance gaps.

We have used the model to evaluate more than 40 diverse facilities worldwide. Most are operating 20 to 50 percent less efficiently than the clean-sheet reference. In one European warehouse, our clean-sheet model showed a performance gap of more than 50 percent.

The gap arose not because the warehouse lacked technology or suffered from the structural disadvantages of the goods it handles. Instead, we found that it is the cumulative effect of dozens of slightly sub-optimal processes and the lack of lean mindset. A few fundamental changes in the way these facilities are organized and managed could immediately close at least half of the gap between current performance and the benchmark.

Some warehouses simply suffer from lack of attention. Designed for one purpose a decade ago, their managers make only minor modifications to cope with dramatic business changes such as increasing product and delivery complexity, a merger or acquisition, or new technologies or supply chain structures.

Some solutions intended to improve performance often have exactly the opposite effect. Technology-heavy approaches, such as automated storage areas, sorting technology or classical transaction-based ERP systems, have a strong tendency to reduce flexibility, particularly short-notice flexibility, which is exactly what many modern supply chains demand. The payback on such systems is poor, with the capital cost being many multiples of the savings achieved by reducing relatively low-cost labor.

Outsourcing is a common practice in pharma, but it often fails to remedy bad warehouse practice. Managers may be tempted to outsource their operations to leverage factor cost advantages, for example, but outsourcing inefficient processes simply offers service providers higher margins. And since warehouse inefficiencies can arise externally, such as volatile demand patterns or undisciplined ordering, providers are often unable to create real cost advantage.

At the heart of transforming warehouse operations is the rigorous and relentless application of lean and six sigma techniques to eliminate sources of waste, variability and inflexibility. Most are simple, pragmatic activities that require little or no financial investment   they rest on six building blocks of performance: processes, people, performance management, third parties interaction, layout and ownership (see Exhibit 2).

"Pfizer To Acquire Medivation  for $14B","Medivation agrees to transaction valued at $81.50 per Medivation share in cash, for a total enterprise value of approximately $14 billion, which propels Pfizer into a leading position in oncology.","http://www.pharmamanufacturing.com/industrynews/2016/pfizer-to-acquire-medivation/","Mon, 22 Aug 2016 13:24:00 -0400","NA","Pfizer To Acquire Medivation for $14BPfizer Inc. and Medivation Inc. have entered into a definitive merger agreement under which Pfizer will acquire Medivation, a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing small molecules for oncology, for $81.50 a share in cash for a total enterprise value of approximately $14 billion. Pfizer does not expect the transaction to impact its current 2016 financial guidance.

""The proposed acquisition of Medivation is expected to immediately accelerate revenue growth and drive overall earnings growth potential for Pfizer,"" said Ian Read, chairman and chief executive officer, Pfizer. ""The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer's Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term. This transaction is another example of how we are effectively deploying our capital to generate attractive returns and create shareholder value.""

Medivation's portfolio includes XTANDI (enzalutamide), an androgen receptor inhibitor that blocks multiple steps in the androgen receptor signaling pathway within the tumor cell. XTANDI is the leading novel hormone therapy in the United States today and generated approximately $2.2 billion in worldwide net sales over the past four quarters, as recorded by Astellas Pharma Inc., with whom Medivation entered an agreement in 2009 to develop XTANDI globally and commercialize jointly in the U.S. Since its approval for advanced metastatic prostate cancer by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 2012, XTANDI has treated 64,000 men to date in the U.S. alone. Medivation and Astellas have built a robust development program for XTANDI, including two Phase 3 studies in non-metastatic prostate cancer and another Phase 3 study in hormone-sensitive prostate cancer. It is also being further developed in Phase 2 studies for the potential treatment of advanced breast cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma.

In addition, Medivation has a wholly-owned, late-stage oncology pipeline, which includes two development-stage oncology assets, talazoparib and pidilizumab. Talazoparib, currently in a Phase 3 study for the treatment of BRCA-mutated breast cancer, has the potential to be a highly potent PARP inhibitor and could be efficacious across several additional tumors. Pidilizumab is an immuno-oncology (IO) asset being developed for diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies and has the potential to be combined with IO therapies in Pfizer s portfolio.

""We believe the combination with Pfizer is the right next step in our growth trajectory and is a testament to the passion and dedication by which the Medivation team has delivered on our mission to profoundly transform patients' lives through medically innovative therapies,"" said David Hung, M.D., founder, president and CEO of Medivation. ""...We believe that Pfizer is the ideal partner to extend the reach of our blockbuster XTANDI franchise and take our promising, late-stage assets - talazoparib and pidiluzimab - to their next stages of development so that they can be made available to patients as quickly as possible.""

""The proposed acquisition of Medivation will build upon Pfizer's success with our IBRANCE (palbociclib) launch in HR+/HER2- metastatic breast cancer and with our strong immuno-oncology portfolio, and will transform Pfizer into a leading oncology company,"" said Albert Bourla, group president, Pfizer Innovative Health. ""IBRANCE and XTANDI are anchor brands in breast and prostate cancer respectively, giving Pfizer leadership in two hormone-driven cancers. Similar to IBRANCE in the breast cancer setting, XTANDI is being explored for its potential to move from metastatic prostate cancer to treat earlier stages of non-metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, Medivation's portfolio within prostate cancer and across diverse tumors will complement Pfizer's broad IO portfolio. Finally, Medivation adds commercial scale to better compete with other top tier oncology companies in advance of the potential emergence of Pfizer's IO pipeline expected in the next few years. Together, we believe Pfizer and Medivation can bring the full force of our combined research and resources to combat two of the most common cancers, as well as speed cures and make accessible breakthrough medicines to patients, redefining life with cancer.""

"Medical News Today: Early Parkinson's diagnosis moves closer with new protein test","A novel test that detects abnormal alpha-synuclein protein was found to identify Parkinson's patients with 95 percent accuracy, researchers report.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312606.php","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Parkinson's Disease","Early Parkinson's diagnosis moves closer with new protein testWhile it is early days for the test, the team's results - published in the journal Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology - have been hailed ""hugely promising.""

Parkinson's disease is a neurological condition whereby production of dopamine in the brain is reduced over time, due to the damage and death of neurons that produce it. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter involved in the regulation of movement and coordination.

As a result, patients with the disease may experience tremors of the hands, arms, legs, jaws, and face, slowed movement, muscle rigidity, impaired posture and balance, and speech problems.

There is currently no definitive test for Parkinson's. The disease is normally diagnosed through assessment of the patient's medical history, a medical examination, and physical and neurological tests, but this can take years.

Now, Dr. Alison Green, of the National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, and colleagues reveal how a test originally developed to detect Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) could be adapted to detect Parkinson's.

In their study, Dr. Green and team report how the test - called the real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) - accurately detected accumulation of the protein alpha-synuclein in the spinal fluid of patients with the disease.

Alpha-synuclein is a protein believed to be associated with onset of both Parkinson's disease and Lewy body dementia.

In people with Parkinson's, the protein has been found to form clumps - called Lewy bodies - in neurons that produce dopamine, while in patients with Lewy body dementia, the clumps form in neurons associated with cognitive abilities.

While previous studies have attempted to develop a test to detect alpha-synuclein, these have produced conflicting results. This is because the protein is present in the brains of healthy individuals, only causing problems when it clumps together.

The test from Dr. Green and colleagues, however, has the ability to measure the stickiness and buildup of proteins, an indicator of whether they are likely to cause disease.

For their study, the researchers applied the test to 20 samples of spinal fluid taken from patients with Parkinson's disease, alongside samples of 15 healthy controls.

They found the test was able to identify 19 out of 20 of samples with 95 percent accuracy and 100 percent specificity. It was also able to detect buildup of the protein in three spinal fluid samples of individuals at high risk for Parkinson's.

The team also applied the test to samples of patients with Lewy body dementia. Compared with control samples, the test was able to detect the disease with 92 percent accuracy and 100 percent specificity.

While these results need to be validated in a larger sample of patients, the researchers are hopeful that their findings could lead to much-needed diagnostic tests for both Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia.

Dr. Green says earlier diagnosis for these patients may mean greater participation in clinical trials of new drugs to prevent disease or slow progression.

Dr. Beckie Port, senior research communications officer at Parkinson's UK, says the team's findings could one day meet the need for a simple, accurate test for Parkinson's.

"Medical News Today: PTSD and cognitive decline linked in 9/11 responders","Long-term study involving more than 800 World Trade Center Responders shows that post-traumatic stress disorder has strong links with cognitive decline.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312599.php","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Alzheimer's / Dementia","PTSD and cognitive decline linked in 9/11 respondersPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a condition that can arise in individuals who have experienced shocking, dangerous, or frightening events.

After a trauma, it is normal to experience a range of reactions. However, in PTSD, these reactions persist and last for months or even years.

Symptoms vary from individual to individual, but one of the most prominent and upsetting symptoms is known as re-experiencing.

Re-experiencing refers to repetitive flashbacks of the event, bad dreams, and frightening thoughts.

Experts believe that re-experiencing might be an early marker of mental pathology.

During the events that took place at the World Trade Center (WTC) on the 11th September, 2001, many responders - firefighters, police, and public - experienced a range of traumas.

According to the authors of the current study, around 20 percent of these responders subsequently developed PTSD.

In July 2002, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) began a monitoring and treatment program for WTC responders. Since it began, more than 33,000 individuals have enrolled in the WTC Health Program.

Researchers from Stony Brook University in New York City took a sample of individuals that attended Stony Brook clinics between January 2014 and April 2015. In all, 818 responders (average age 52.8 years) were screened. Researchers assessed the participant's concentration, reasoning, memory, and problem-solving abilities.

Each individual was also checked by psychologists to diagnose PTSD and major depressive disorder (MDD).

The CDC's dataset of WTC responders is a unique opportunity to understand more about PTSD and how it can impact an individual's cognitive performance over time.

Below are the headline findings of the study:

If the percentages taken from this research are scaled up to the 33,000 responders currently signed up with the CDC, they translate to 3,740-5,300 individuals with cognitive impairment and 240-810 with dementia.

""These numbers are staggering, considering that the average age of responders was 53 during this study. If our results are replicable, doctors need to be aware of the impact of cognitive impairment among individuals who have experienced traumatic events leading to PTSD. For example, cognitive impairment can compound the course of PTSD and depression, impairing the person beyond the impact of PTSD itself.""

Clouston and his team made a number of other interesting discoveries:

The authors also recognize some shortfalls in the research, including the fact that the sample was not random - participants had been selected for screening. Also, the study did not take into account previous head injuries; future studies should investigate whether earlier head trauma could play a role in PTSD's relationship with cognitive impairment.

PTSD affects an estimated 7.7 million Americans; the more information researchers can unearth, the easier it will be to design effective treatment and support. The CDC's WTC data set will be a vital tool in this quest for understanding.

Most people show spondylosis in their spine as they get older. These age-related differences in the spine vary from one person to the next and do not usually cause problems.

When spondylosis does cause symptoms, they are usually occasional pain and stiffness.

Spondylosis in the neck is called cervical spondylosis. Spondylosis changes can also be seen in other segments of the spine, including the lumbar region, or lower back.

People are more likely to get spondylosis as they age. One article that reviewed the evidence appeared in the journal Neurosurgery. It suggested that spondylosis may be seen in 10 percent of people by the age of 25 years - but in 95 percent by the age of 65. Only some people have problems as a result.

Just about everyone over 70 years of age is likely to show some spondylosis on spine X-rays. Researchers have confirmed that the wear and tear affects almost everyone.

Spinal osteoarthritis is another term used for spondylosis. Osteoarthritis is the type of arthritis caused by wear and tear, and can affect any joint in the body.

The spine is the backbone, running from the base of the head to the tailbone. This part of the skeleton gives the body structure and supports most of its weight. It also carries and protects almost all of the main nerve branches that run from the brain.

The spine has an elegantly curved shape. It is a column made up of bones known as vertebrae. These vertebrae have joints between them to allow the spine to move flexibly.

The bones of vertebrae are separated by softer, rubbery tissues. These cartilage surfaces and discs between the vertebrae give smooth movement and cushion against any impact on the bones.

As bodies get older, the discs gradually age. They lose some of their cushioning ability because they become drier. This makes the discs thinner and harder.

The other main contact between one vertebra and the next is formed by the facet joints. These joints also break down with age because of wear and tear on their cartilage surfaces.

The body can respond to the spondylosis. More growth of bone can happen, triggered by the direct contact of bones rubbing against each other. Spondylosis can then result in bony growths known as spurs or projections.

The loss of rubbery tissues and the formation of spurs make the spine stiffer. Back movement also becomes less smooth. There is more friction between the bones of the spine.

For some people, symptoms worse than general stiffness can also arise from these changes in the spine.

Spondylosis can result in a narrowing of the canal that carries the spinal cord nerves. Doctors call this spinal stenosis. Changes to the spinal bones can also rub against spinal nerves, causing problems.

Daily wear and tear on the muscles and bones over time is the overall cause of spondylosis.

These changes affect different people to varying extents, and genetics have a great influence. Some people, for example, are born with narrower spinal canals, which are more prone to problems when they narrow down.

Other factors that are linked to worse problems with spondylosis include:

Most people who have spondylosis in their spine as they get older do not experience any symptoms.

For people who do get symptoms, they are usually not too troublesome. Spondylosis can cause some stiffness and mild pain. This can occasionally get worse with certain movements or prolonged periods without movement

Only some people with spondylosis experience bad pain. In some cases, the changes to the spine can affect the nerves. If the bone narrows up the space for the spinal cord, it can put pressure on it, irritating it or damaging it.

Disease of the spinal nerves can then result in symptoms such as numbness, tingling sensations, and weakness. In neck spondylosis, this can affect the arms, hands, or fingers. In lumbar spondylosis, the legs may be affected.

Cervical spondylosis can pinch on a nerve for the neck so that it causes a strange sensation. This type of neck problem is called radiculopathy. Here, the neck muscle can feel numb or weak.

Symptoms will differ according to the part of the spine affected. Spondylosis in the lower back may produce symptoms that affect sitting. With a problem in the lower spine, muscle weakness or other nerve-related problems will affect the legs rather than the neck or arms. The neck and arms are affected by the more common case of spondylosis in the neck.

Most cases of spondylosis do not need treatment as they produce only mild, occasional problems of stiffness and pain.

General advice for a non-troubling case of pain due to spinal aging is to:

Exercise can loosen stiff joints and strengthen other muscles that will support the aging spine. Rest is needed when pain is bad, though.

Physical therapists are among the healthcare providers who can help with exercise advice. They can also do physical manipulation with therapies such as massage.

If pain is persistent or particularly bad, doctors can help by offering drug treatments that are available only on prescription. These include:

The steroid injection is aimed at relieving pain for a while by reducing inflammation. In the case of neck spondylitis, it is given to reach the nerve roots that come out of the part of the spine affected.

Other drugs that are sometimes used include:

Patients should always follow the advice of doctors and pharmacists about the effects of drugs and how medications should be used.

Surgery is always the last option after other spondylosis treatments have failed. An operation is only an option in a limited number of cases where the problem is severe, including because of lasting bad pain.

Severe problems where spondylosis could require surgery include when:

The surgeons will do whatever operation matches the exact problem with the spine. This will be planned against the overall clinical signs and the findings of scans such as X-rays.

Examples of surgical procedures to treat complications of spondylosis include:

Most people with spondylosis do not need an operation. Any surgery carries risks, but the chances of these should be outweighed by the potential improvements.

Operations need a recovery period, followed by weeks and months before the patient is completely fit again.","Pharmaceuticals"

"Medical News Today: Folic acid may protect against congenital heart defects","Findings from a study of Canadian data show that fortifying foods with folic acid are associated with reduced rates of congenital heart defects.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312588.php","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Nutrition / Diet","Folic acid may protect against congenital heart defectsFolic acid is a B vitamin that our bodies use to make new cells, and it is important for the development of a healthy fetus.

Adding folic acid to white flour, pasta, and cornmeal has been mandatory in Canada since 1998. Evidence of folic acid reducing neural tube defects, oral cleft, and cardiovascular anomalies led to the Government of Canada taking steps to help women of childbearing age increase the amount of folate they consume.

The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend that women take 400 micrograms of folic acid per day from at least 1 month before getting pregnant to prevent major birth defects of the baby's brain (anencephaly) and spine (spina bifida).

The research was conducted to determine if there is an association between food fortification with folic acid and birth prevalence of specific congenital heart defects (CHDs).

According to the study, there are approximately 650,000 to 1.3 million U.S. children and adults living with congenital heart disease. The most common type of defect in children is ventricular septal defects, which account for 620,000 of cases.

Previous studies have yielded inconsistent results for the effects of folic acid and folic acid food fortification on CHDs.

""Our study examined the effect of folic acid food fortification on each specific subtype of congenital heart disease based on the Canadian experience before and after food fortification was made mandatory in 1998,"" says Dr. K.S. Joseph, Ph.D., the study's senior author and professor in the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology and the School of Population and Public Health at the University of British Columbia in Vancouver, Canada.

Researchers analyzed data from almost 6 million births in Canada between 1990-2011 and controlled for influencing factors, such as maternal age, multiple births (twins, triplets), pregnancy complications, prenatal diagnosis, and pregnancy terminations.

Findings indicated that folic acid food fortification was associated with an 11 percent decrease in rates of congenital heart defects.

Dr. Joseph and colleagues also noted that the beneficial effects of folic acid were only observed in some types of CHDs. For example, there was a 27 percent reduction in conotruncal defects, or severe heart outflow tract abnormalities, and a 23 percent decrease in coarctation of the aorta, which is a narrowing of the major artery that carries blood to the body.

Also, a 15 percent reduction was seen in atrial and ventricular septal defects, which are the holes in the wall that separate the heart chambers. No change was observed concerning chromosomally associated defects - an abnormality in the number of an infant's chromosomes.

Dr. Joseph says that although the data is from Canada, the findings apply to the U.S. population, as the same fortification of foods with folic acid were implemented in the U.S. around the same time as Canada due to the North American Fair Trade Agreement of 1994.

""Older maternal age, prepregnancy diabetes mellitus, and preterm preeclampsia were also associated with population rates of CHDs,"" they add.

Dr. Joseph highlights the importance of taking folic acid for women who are trying to become pregnant, as they may not receive an adequate amount of folate from diet alone.

While food fortification with folic acid was aimed at reducing neural tube defects, the study shows that folic acid may also have a beneficial effect on specific types of CHDs, which are collectively more common.

"Medical News Today: The Paleo diet: Could it reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?","Healthy adults who followed the Paleo diet for 8 weeks had lower levels of a molecule called interleukin-10, suggesting a lower heart attack risk.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312589.php","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Nutrition / Diet","The Paleo diet: Could it reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease?Chad Dolan, of the Laboratory of Integrative Psychology at the University of Houston, TX, and colleagues found that healthy adults who swapped from a Western diet to a Paleo diet experienced an increase in interleukin-10 (IL-10) levels, indicating a lower risk of heart attack and cardiovascular disease.

The researchers recently reported their preliminary findings at the American Physiological Society's Inflammation, Immunity and Cardiovascular Disease Conference in Westminster, CO.

The Paleo diet is based on foods believed to have been consumed by our hunter-gatherer ancestors, including fruits, vegetables, nuts and seeds, fish, lean meats, and plant-based oils - such as olive oil. Processed foods, dairy products, potatoes, salt, refined sugar, grains, and legumes should be avoided, as should coffee and alcohol.

Advocators of the Paleo diet claim it is the healthiest way of eating; Loren Cordain, Ph.D., founder of the Paleo diet movement, says on his website that the diet ""will help to optimize your health, minimize your risk of chronic disease, and lose weight.""

The rationale behind this is that the body is better suited to the diet of early humans, and that it is a modern diet and the body's inability to adapt to it that fuels chronic illness.

However, this theory has been met with much criticism, with some researchers arguing that since our ancient ancestors only lived until an average age of 30-35 years, following the diet may not be good for health.

Earlier this year, one study even suggested that the diet could be ""dangerous,"" leading to rapid weight gain and increasing the risk of diabetes.

Dolan and colleagues, however, find that when it comes to heart health, the Paleo diet has its benefits.

For their study, the researchers enrolled eight healthy adults who normally consumed a Western diet - typically high in saturated fats and processed foods, and low in fruits, vegetables, and fish.

After initial counseling on how to adhere to the Paleo diet, subjects were asked to switch to it for 8 weeks. They were given a Paleo diet menu and recipe guide to help them with food choices, and they were told they could eat as many of these foods as they wished over the 8-week period.

On assessing blood samples taken from the participants before and after the diet swap, the researchers found that they demonstrated an average 35 percent increase in levels of the molecule IL-10.

The researchers explain that low levels of IL-10 indicate a greater risk of heart attack among individuals who have high inflammation levels, though they note they are yet to analyze participants' inflammation levels.

Still, they believe that higher IL-10 levels - seen with the Paleo diet - could lower inflammation, protecting blood vessels and reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease.

The researchers also noted a reduction in participants' calorie intake and weight with the 8-week Paleo diet, though they note the study was not designed to promote weight loss.

The researchers that their study is incomplete at present, but they are encouraged by the early results.

""This study's findings add to the possibility that short-term dietary changes from a traditional Western pattern of eating to foods promoted in the Paleo diet may improve health - or, at the very least, the diet does not have negative health implications in terms of the parameters we studied. If our research continues to show that the Paleo diet produces detectable changes in healthy individuals, it will substantiate claims made by those supporting this diet for the past few decades and provide preliminary evidence for another therapeutic strategy for cardiovascular disease and coronary artery disease prevention.""

The team plans to conduct another study with more participants, who will follow the Paleo diet for a longer period of time, in order to assess how it influences cardiovascular disease risk factors.

"Medical News Today: Replacing old memories with new for people who fear spiders","Triggering, interrupting, and resaving the memory of something unpleasant may help people to lose their phobia of spiders or other sources of anxiety.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312555.php","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Psychology / Psychiatry","Replacing old memories with new for people who fear spidersBut for some people, phobias of spiders, heights, and even other people can make daily living a challenge.

Now, research published in Current Biology suggests that tweaking exposure therapy - a common strategy for individuals facing phobias - could make it more effective at helping people to get over their fears.

An overwhelming fear of something, be it flying, needles, or snakes, affects 12.5 million Americans, according to the National Institute for Mental Health (NIMH). In nearly 22 percent of these people, the phobia is classed as severe.

A phobia is a kind of anxiety. Studies indicate that up to 30 percent of all people experience some form of anxiety disorder at some time. Severe anxiety can be debilitating to the point where people can no longer carry out their daily tasks.

Exposure therapy is a common treatment for phobias. The process gradually brings the patient to face the thing or the situation that they are afraid of. The aim is to create a new, ""safe"" memory, to replace the old fearful one.

The problem is that the new memory is not always permanent, and in time, for many people, the bad memory resurfaces.

Now, researchers from Uppsala University and Karolinska Institutet in Sweden believe they have found a way to make the new, good memory more permanent.

The scientists wanted to see whether exposure therapy might be more effective if the recreation of fear memories in people with arachnophobia was disrupted.

Normally, reminding a person of an object or a context renders the memory unstable as it is resaved. This resaving is called reconsolidation. If the creation of the memory is disrupted at this stage, the memory that is saved can be changed.

There is a theory that if a fear memory can be made weaker or deleted, it could pave the way for better treatment for anxiety disorders, but so far, older and stronger memories have been difficult to disrupt.

The Swedish team has developed an approach that appears to decrease fear in people with life-long phobias.

In their experiment, people with arachnophobia were exposed to spider pictures, while the researchers measured the level of brain activity in the amygdala. The amygdala is a brain area that is strongly associated with fear.

The researchers activated the fear memory through a mini exposure to spider pictures, followed 10 minutes later with a more extensive exposure. The following day, participants again looked at the pictures.

Results showed that activity in the amygdala was significantly lower on the second day, compared with a control group, suggesting a reduction in fear levels. As the fear decreased, so did the participants' avoidance of spiders.

The researchers conclude that, even if a memory is decades old, making it unstable before providing exposure can weaken it. If the memory is resaved in its weakened form, the fear does not return as easily.

The authors believe that applying this technique to therapy for people with phobias could lead to more effective therapy.

Co-author Johannes Bj rkstrand, of the Department of Psychology at Uppsala University, comments: ""It is striking that such a simple manipulation so clearly affects brain activity and behavior. A simple modification of existing treatments could possibly improve effects. This would mean more people getting rid of their anxieties after treatment and fewer relapses.""

Why people are afraid of spiders in the first place remains something of a mystery.

Evidence suggests that from a young age, girls are statistically more likely to be spider-phobic than boys, possibly due to early conditioning. Other researchers argue that the fear of spiders is in the genes, and not due to conditioning at all.

"Medical News Today: How sitting in traffic jams can harm your health","Levels of air pollution are high in traffic jams and at traffic-light controlled intersections. Closing the windows and turning off the fan can help.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312570.php","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Water - Air Quality / Agriculture","How sitting in traffic jams can harm your healthThe World Health Organization (WHO) describe outdoor air pollution as a ""major environmental risk to health,"" linking it to 3.7 million premature deaths worldwide in 2012.

Air pollution contributes to lung cancer, asthma, and other respiratory diseases, and it has been associated with heart disease and stroke. All of these can be fatal.

In 2013, the WHO classified outdoor air pollution in cities as being as carcinogenic to humans as smoking was in February 1985.

In the United States, exposure to particulate matter in the air is the eighth leading cause of death each year. In London in the United Kingdom, deaths related to air pollution are estimated to be 10 times higher than fatalities caused by road traffic accidents.

Research led by Dr. Prashant Kumar, from the University of Surrey, U.K., has shown that 25 percent of exposure to harmful particles when driving occurs in the 2 percent of the journey time that drivers spend passing through intersections with traffic lights.

At intersections, vehicles slow down, stop, rev up to move when lights turn green, and they are closer together.

This leads to levels of peak particle concentration at a signalized intersection that are 29 times higher than those found in free-flowing traffic. In addition, the cars move slowly, so that drivers are exposed for longer. As the output is ongoing, the pollution does not disperse but lingers and accumulates.

As a result, cars waiting in traffic jams or at red lights contain up to 40 percent more pollution than those that are moving.

In a new study, Dr. Prashant and his team have been looking for a solution.

The scientists took measurements of particulate matter in a moving car under five different ventilation settings. The car traveled 6 kilometers and passed through 10 different traffic lights.

They took measurements at 3-way and 4-way intersections managed by traffic lights.

The authors wanted to see how the different ventilation settings would affect particulate matter inside the car. They also looked at how levels of pollution within the car compared with those experienced by pedestrians crossing roads at the same traffic lights.

Results showed that the ventilation system of the car was efficient at removing coarse particles from the air, but as the concentration of coarse particles fell, the number of fine particles increased. The highest levels of pollution within the car tended to occur when the windows were closed at the traffic lights and the fan was on.

Pedestrians at intersections were also exposed to additional pollution, but the level of particulate matter to which motorists were exposed was up to seven times that experienced by pedestrians.

To reduce the amount of pollution exposure while waiting in traffic jams and at traffic lights, the authors suggest that, weather permitting, motorists should close car windows and switch off the fan. This, they say, can reduce the chance of breathing in hazardous levels of air pollution by 76 percent.

They also recommend setting the fan so that the air circulates internally. Recirculating the air prevents pollution from entering from outside.

""Where possible and with weather conditions allowing, it is one of the best ways to limit your exposure by keeping windows shut, fans turned off and to try and increase the distance between you and the car in front while in traffic jams or stationary at traffic lights.  If the fan or heater needs to be on, the best setting would be to have the air re-circulating within the car without drawing in air from outdoors. Of course improving the efficiency of filtering systems of vehicles in future could further benefit to curtail the on-road exposure in such situations.""

In 2015, Dr. Prashant and his team called on drivers to be aware of the hazards of pollution at intersections, and they suggested that keeping a distance from the car in front could help to reduce the risk.

The researchers urged pedestrians to find walking routes that did not include signalized traffic intersections. They also noted that local transport authorities could help by synchronizing traffic signals, as this can reduce waiting time. Alternative traffic management systems such as flyovers could also help to alleviate the problem, they say.

"Medical News Today: Should I Worry About a Cherry Angioma? Get the Facts","Cherry angiomas are small, benign skin growths made of small blood vessels. Learn about what they look like, when to see a doctor, and treatment.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312594.php","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Dermatology","Should I Worry About a Cherry Angioma? Get the FactsA cherry angioma is a mole-like skin growth made up of small blood vessels, or capillaries. It is the most common type of angioma, which is a benign tumor that results from an overgrowth of capillaries.

It is rare for children to develop these noncancerous lesions. Cherry angiomas most commonly appear in adults older than 30.

Cherry angiomas are related to aging and tend to increase in number with age. They occur in up to 50 percent of adults, according to one study published in American Family Physician.

Cherry angiomas are also known as senile angiomas or Campbell de Morgan spots after Dr. Campbell Greig de Morgan, a British surgeon who first officially studied them in the 19th century.

Cherry angiomas get their name from their appearance. Their bright red color is due to the broken capillaries.

However, cherry angiomas can range in color and may also look blue or purple. If pressure is applied to them, they might momentarily turn white.

Cherry angiomas can also range in size, but commonly grow to be a few millimeters in diameter. As they get bigger, the angiomas usually form round, dome shapes with smooth, flat tops.

These growths can appear anywhere on the body, but they are most often found on the chest, stomach, and back. It's not uncommon that cherry angiomas appear in multiple numbers, although this could be a sign of another issue.

Cherry angiomas may be confused with spider angiomas, which also have a signature red mole. The difference between the two is that a spider angioma has distinctive reddish extensions that expand out from the red spot. The extensions look similar to the threads in a spider's web.

The causes of cherry angiomas are largely unknown, though experts believe they tend to be genetic. Age is a contributing factor, and cherry angiomas increase in number and size after age 40.

There is some research that suggests exposure to bromides may be associated with cherry angiomas. Bromine is a chemical compound found in many everyday items, including baking ingredients, prescription drugs, and plastic.

At present, there is little firm evidence to support this theory. More research needs to be carried out in this area.

If someone is in direct contact with bromine often, this may be something they can speak to a doctor about and be tested for.

The appearance of a cherry angioma is not usually concerning as they are almost always harmless. However, if anyone notices a sudden outbreak of several lesions, it's a good idea to visit the doctor. Although rare, these spider angiomas could signal a developing problem, such as liver damage.

Medical attention is also recommended if the angioma begins to bleed, feel bothersome, or change in appearance. Those who wish to have the lesions removed for cosmetic purposes should schedule an appointment with their doctor to review their options.

Most often, treatment for cherry angiomas is strictly cosmetic, as they pose no serious threat. There are four common options for treating angiomas.

This method involves cutting or shaving the lesion off the skin. The doctor will usually apply a local anesthetic first to minimize pain. There may be some pain and discomfort after the procedure, however. Excision can also result in some scarring.

This is a method also known as electrocautery that involves burning off skin growths. It is commonly used for benign tumors like cherry angiomas, less serious skin cancers, and pre-cancers.

First, the doctor will likely inject a local anesthetic. Then, they will touch the abnormal tissue with an electric needle to destroy the blood vessels and essentially scrape the angioma off. The wound is then dressed until it heals.

Like with excision, this method can cause some discomfort after the procedure. Electrodesiccation usually leaves a small, white scar.

This is another common method used to treat skin growths that works by freezing off the tissue. First, the doctor will spray or swab liquid nitrogen on the area to freeze it. This causes the angioma to blister or peel before falling off. In some cases, the angioma may scab before it's removed.

A laser passes through the skin, and the blood vessels in the angioma absorb the beam. After the treatment, it's normal for the angioma to disappear, or turn gray or another darker color. It will then fade over the next 2-4 weeks.

On average, two treatments are needed for the best results, but results vary by skin tone. For some smaller angiomas, a single treatment may be enough.

Patients should see improvement after each treatment. It's important to avoid sun exposure for about 4 weeks before and 2 weeks after laser treatment for best results and minimal side effects.

In general, the various methods for angioma removal are similar in levels of discomfort and effectiveness. It is best for patients to discuss with a doctor which option is best for them.

It's also important to remember that although angiomas can be removed, they can sometimes return after treatment. Patients should keep an eye on healing and improvement after any removal treatment. Any worsening or abnormal changes should be reported to a doctor.

It is not recommended that people attempt to remove a cherry angioma at home for a number of reasons. Firstly, it's critical that a doctor confirms that the skin growth is a cherry angioma and not a lesion that needs a more careful look.

Secondly, attempting to shave, cut, burn, or freeze a cherry angioma can be very painful and lead to infection if done by an amateur. Doctors are professionally trained to remove skin growths, and they do so in sterile environments using sterile tools.

Anyone who wishes to have a cherry angioma removed for cosmetic reasons should consult their doctor to discuss the options.

There are a number of home remedies that use apple cider vinegar, iodine, or tea tree oil to shrink or remove cherry angiomas. However, there is no scientific evidence that any of these natural solutions are effective.

Before taking or applying any new medication, it's always a good idea to talk to a doctor to make sure they're safe to use.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Understanding the unhappy side of serotonin","Antidepressants improve mood by boosting serotonin levels, but serotonin can have negative effects, too. Scientists have been exploring why this happens.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312537.php","Sun, 28 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Depression","Understanding the unhappy side of serotoninNow, scientists believe they have identified what happens in the brain to cause this, according to research published in Nature.

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are used to treat anxiety, depression, and related conditions. Around 10 percent of people in the United States use them, including 1 in 4 women in their 40s and 50s.

Serotonin, a neurotransmitter, is the ""happy hormone"" thought to boost feelings of well-being. Abnormally low levels of serotonin have been linked to depression. SSRIs are thought to improve mood by boosting serotonin activity in the brain.

But serotonin is not always a bed of roses. In the early days of treatment, it can increase levels of fear and anxiety and even suicidal thinking in some younger people. As a result, patients may stop using the treatment after a few weeks.

When serotonin works through certain brain circuits, it seems to improve mood, but when but it acts on others circuits, the effect is different.

Researchers from the University of North Carolina Medical School in Chapel Hill, NC, have identified a circuit that seems to be related to serotonin-driven anxiety.

Using a range of methods, such as advanced optogenetic and chemogenetic tools, the team was able to trace a serotonin-activated pathway in the brains of mice that appears to drive anxious behavior.

First, the team delivered a mild shock to the paws of mice - a standard way of triggering behaviors related to fear and anxiety. This was shown to activate serotonin-producing neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DRN).

The DRN is a brainstem region associated with mood and depression. DRN serotonin neurons project to a brain region known as the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BNST). Previous studies have shown that BNST is involved when serotonin triggers a negative mood in rodents.

When the team artificially increased the activity of the DRN-to-BNST neurons in the mice, anxiety-like behaviors increased.

The researchers found that the receptors through which serotonin output from the DRN is activated are the 2C serotonin receptors. Through the 2C receptors, the target BNST neurons are activated.

The serotonin-activated BNST neurons then dampen the activity of another group of BNST neurons.

This group projects to the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and lateral hypothalamus (LH). The VTA and LH are key nodes in the brain's reward, motivation and alertness networks.

Previous studies have suggested that the pathways from BNST to VTA and LH play a role in improving mood and relieve anxiety.

Findings showed that increasing the activity of these pathways reduced the fear anxiety caused by the foot-shock treatment in the mice. Decreasing it raised anxiety levels.

Prozac, or fluoxetine, boosts serotonin levels. When the scientists exposed 2C-receptor BNST neurons to Prozac, it increased the effect of the 2C-receptor neurons on the neighboring VTA- and LH-projecting neurons. The mice became more fearful and anxious.

To find out how to stop this effect, senior author Thomas L. Kash and his team focused on the anxiety-mediating BNST neurons. They noticed that these neurons expressed a molecule, known as corticotropin releasing factor (CRF). CRF is a stress-signaling neurotransmitter. It is sometimes called corticotropin releasing hormone (CHR).

When the team added a compound to block CRF activity, the fear and anxiety that had been triggered by the Prozac were greatly reduced.

Kash believes the same thing would happen in humans. SSRIs can cause anxiety in people, he says, and mice and humans tend to have very similar pathways in these brain regions.

The authors hope that this discovery will lead to the development of drugs to counter the negative effects of SSRIs.

The next step will be to test drugs, preferably ones that are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), to see if they can change the anxiety circuit and block the negative side effects of the SSRIs.

A CRF-blocker might work. Pharmaceutical companies have been looking at CRF blockers for the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction for some time, but without success so far. Kash does not expect a solution from this quarter just yet.

An alternative to better CRF blockers, he suggests, could be to target the proteins expressed by the BNST neurons. He hopes to identify a receptor that existing drugs can already target.

One of these drugs could prevent people who are starting on SSRIs from having to go through the fear and anxiety stage.

Apart from offering hope to people who are experiencing depression, the discovery also deepens human understanding of the brain networks that underlie fear and anxiety behavior in mammals.

The findings come from an analysis of more than 2,800 teenage girls from 57 schools across Western Australia, of whom more than 1,200 took part in the VIP program.

The VIP program consists of educational sessions - delivered in schools over a 6-day period - on a number of subjects, including sexual health, contraception, the effects of alcohol and drug use in pregnancy, and the financial costs of having a baby.

Teenagers who take part in the program are also required to care for a baby simulator over one weekend. This is a robotic doll that cries when it needs to be fed, changed, burped, or rocked, and it contains a tracker that measures and reports whether all these requirements have been tended to.

The tracker also measures any mishandling events, such as placing the baby into the wrong sleep position or aggressive shaking.

Schemes similar to the VIP program are commonplace in many countries across the globe, including the United States, in the form of the RealityWorks program.

While the purpose of these programs is to educate teenage girls and reduce rates of teenage pregnancy, lead study author Dr. Sally Brinkman - of the Telethon Kids Institute at the University of Western Australia - and colleagues note that there have been no published studies providing evidence of their long-term effects.

With a view to addressing this research gap, the researchers enrolled 57 schools in Western Australia, including a total of 2,834 girls aged 13-15 years.

Schools were randomly allocated to take part in either the VIP program or standard health education (the control group). A total of 1,267 girls took part in the VIP program, while 1,567 girls received standard health education.

Through data linkage to the birth register and medical records from hospitals and abortion clinics, the team monitored pregnancy outcomes for participants until they reached the age of 20.

Compared with the controls, the researchers found that girls who took part in the VIP program were more likely to have become pregnant or have had an abortion.

In detail, 8 percent of the girls who participated in the VIP program had at least one birth and 9 percent had an abortion, while incidences of pregnancy and abortion in the control group were 4 percent and 6 percent, respectively.

These findings remained after accounting for participants' socioeconomic and educational statuses, the authors note.

Dr. Brinkman and team say their results suggest the VIP program does not reduce the risk of pregnancy among teenage girls, and it might even increase such a risk.

Speaking about the limitations of their study, the researchers point out that there was a low participation rate in the selected schools - 58 percent among schools that participated in the VIP program and 45 percent in the control schools.

Still, the team says individual enrollment to the VIP program was voluntary, so it is likely that the girls who chose to take part are an accurate reflection of those who would take part in the real world, boosting the strength of the findings.

In an editorial linked to the study, Prof. Julie A. Quinlivan, of the University of Notre Dame Australia, says that in order to reduce teenage pregnancy rates, interventions need to be wider-reaching.

""The cure for teenage pregnancy is more difficult than a magic doll. We have to address both mothers and fathers. Programs need to start in infancy. Investment in vulnerable children is needed to entice these adolescents from the path of premature parenthood into brighter futures. We cannot afford the quick fix, especially when it doesn't work.""

"Medical News Today: All You Need to Know About Nephritis","Learn all about nephritis, a condition where the kidney becomes inflamed. This article looks at the causes, symptoms, and treatment of nephritis.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312579.php","Sun, 28 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Urology / Nephrology","All You Need to Know About NephritisTo understand kidney problems such as nephritis, it's helpful to start with some background on what the kidneys are, and what they do.

The kidneys are two bean-shaped, fist-sized organs found just under the ribs on the left and right sides of the spine. They remove impurities and extra water from the blood, filtering 120-150 quarts of blood a day, according to the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Each kidney consists of thousands of structures called nephrons, where the actual blood filtering takes place. In the nephron, a two-step cleaning process separates what the body needs to keep from what it can get rid of.

A filter called the glomerulus catches blood cells and protein, sending water and waste to a second filter, called a tubule. The tubule captures minerals. After that, what remains leaves the body as urine.

Nephritis describes a condition in which the kidney's tubules and nearby tissues become inflamed, which can lead to kidney damage.

When kidneys are damaged, they don't work properly. Waste builds up and causes serious health problems. If the condition is severe enough, or lasts long enough, it can result in kidney failure.

Acute glomerulonephritis: This form of nephritis can develop suddenly after a serious infection, such as strep throat, hepatitis, or HIV. It can also be caused by lupus and less common conditions such as Goodpasture syndrome or granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA). It requires prompt medical attention to prevent kidney damage.

Alport Syndrome: This disease can lead to kidney failure, as well as vision and hearing problems. It tends to run in families and is usually more severe in men.

Chronic glomerulonephritis: Developing slowly, and with few symptoms in the early stages, this disease can cause serious kidney damage and kidney failure. It may run in families, or develop after a sudden case of disease.

IgA nephropathy: One of the most common forms of nephritis, aside from those linked to diseases like diabetes and lupus. It develops when deposits of antibodies are formed in the kidney and cause inflammation.

More common in men than women, it is rarely found in young people because early symptoms are easy to miss. It is often treated with blood pressure medications.

Interstitial nephritis: Often developing very rapidly, this form of nephritis is usually caused by medications or infections. It affects the part of the kidney known as the interstitium. If patients are quickly taken off the medication causing the problems, a full recovery is possible in a few weeks.

There are many different causes for nephritis. In some cases, the cause may not be clear. Nephritis and kidney disease can run in families, which suggests a possible genetic link. Infections, such as HIV and hepatitis B or C, can also cause nephritis.

As many as 60 percent of those diagnosed with lupus, an autoimmune disease, also develop nephritis. As a result, there may be a connection with immune system problems.

In some cases, medications like antibiotics damage the kidneys, leading to nephritis. Taking too many painkillers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and water pills can also cause nephritis.

The most important risk factors for kidney disease are:

African-Americans, Hispanics, Native Americans, Alaskan natives, Asians, and Pacific Islanders are more likely to develop kidney problems than Caucasians.

Symptoms of nephritis are usually not severe in the early stages. However, to protect the kidneys from permanent damage, it's important to seek medical attention if these symptoms are present:

Nephritis may first be detected by routine blood or urine tests. Finding protein in the urine can indicate that the kidneys are not working properly. A blood test that measures a waste product in the blood called creatinine also sheds light on kidney health.

The best way to check for nephritis is to do a biopsy. For this procedure, a doctor uses a needle to remove a piece of the kidney and studies it.

Blood in the urine, or urine that looks brown, is a clear signal to seek medical help immediately. Other signs include foamy urine, changes in the frequency of urination, and swelling around the face or ankles. These are symptoms of nephritis.

People should seek medical assistance quickly to limit possible kidney damage if one or more symptoms develop.

The treatment for nephritis depends on whether the disease is acute, chronic, or linked to other diseases, such as lupus.

Acute nephritis sometimes goes away on its own. It usually requires treatment with medication and special procedures to remove excess fluids and dangerous proteins.

Treating chronic nephritis typically involves regular check-ups on the kidneys and monitoring blood pressure. Doctors may prescribe water pills to both control blood pressure and reduce any swelling patients have.

Medications that keep the immune system from attacking the kidneys are helpful in some cases. Doctors may also recommend dietary changes, such as cutting back on protein, salt, and potassium.

Acute episodes of nephritis often respond well to treatment. Sometimes, years after an acute episode, individuals develop chronic glomerulonephritis. Although these diseases may not always be curable, proper treatment can keep the disease at bay and protect the kidneys.

It's important to follow a doctor's instructions very carefully to prevent and limit kidney damage.

If kidney failure occurs, the best remaining options are kidney dialysis or a transplant. Dialysis is a medical process that mimics the way healthy kidneys remove waste and excess fluid and maintain safe levels of chemicals in the blood.

Kidney problems make following these healthy guidelines more important than ever:

A healthy diet can help protect kidney health. Individuals with kidney problems are frequently advised to eat less protein and cut down on salt.

It can be helpful to talk to a specially trained dietician to learn how to adopt a kidney-friendly diet and avoid medications that harm the kidneys like non-steroidal anti-inflammatories.

Lupus is an auto-immune disease, which means it's a condition in which the body's immune system attacks its own tissues.

More than half of individuals diagnosed with lupus eventually develop lupus nephritis, when the disease causes the kidneys to become inflamed. The symptoms of lupus nephritis include:

These symptoms may appear along with lupus symptoms, such as joint problems, fevers, and rashes.

Although the severity of lupus can vary between patients and the disease sometimes goes into remission, when lupus affects the kidneys, it's serious. Prompt medical attention is needed to limit further damage to the kidneys.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Coffee intake depends on gene variation, study suggests","The amount of coffee a person drinks each day could be down to a particular genetic variant that affects caffeine metabolism, new research finds.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312547.php","Sat, 27 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Nutrition / Diet","Coffee intake depends on gene variation, study suggestsStudy co-author Dr. Nicola Pirastu, from the Usher Institute at the University of Edinburgh in the United Kingdom, and colleagues publish their findings in the journal Scientific Reports.

It goes without saying that the U.S. is a nation of coffee drinkers; more than half of Americans drink coffee daily, consuming an average of three cups a day.

But while some people are happy with a never-ending supply of the hot stuff, others are content with a single cup of coffee to wake them up in the morning.

Previous research has suggested these disparities in coffee consumption may be down to differences in the way a person's body responds to caffeine - the main stimulant in coffee - but precisely what is behind these differences has been unclear.

Some studies have suggested certain genes may play a role; a 2014 study published in the journal Molecular Psychiatry, for example, identified a number of genetic variants associated with caffeine metabolism.

Now, Dr. Pirastu and colleagues say they have identified another genetic variant that may explain why some people drink less coffee than others.

To reach their findings, the team analyzed the genetic data of 1,213 people from Italy. Of these, 843 were from six villages across north-east Italy, while 370 were from a small village in south Italy.

All participants completed a survey that disclosed how many cups of coffee they drank each day.

The team found that coffee consumption was lower for subjects who had a DNA variation in the PDSS2 gene; they drank an average of one less cup of coffee daily, compared with those who did not have the PDSS2 DNA variation.

In a further study of 1,731 individuals from the Netherlands, the researchers were able to replicate their findings, though they note that the effect of this gene variant on reduction of coffee consumption was not as strong.

The team speculates that this might be due to differences in coffee drinking styles between the two populations; people from Italy tend to consume smaller cups of coffee, such as espresso, while individuals from the Netherlands are more likely to drink larger cups of coffee that contain more caffeine.

Explaining the possible mechanisms behind their findings, the researchers suggest that the DNA variation in the PDSS2 gene lowers cells' ability to break down caffeine following coffee consumption, prolonging the amount of time the stimulant remains in the body.

As a result, individuals with this genetic variant do not need to drink as much coffee in order to get the same caffeine hit as those without the variant.

The authors note that Italian coffee company Illy took part in the study, but they did not provide any funding.

"Medical News Today: Peritonitis: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment","Learn all about the symptoms, causes, and treatment of peritonitis, an urgent problem affecting the tissue around the inside of the belly wall.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312552.php","Sat, 27 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","GastroIntestinal / Gastroenterology","Peritonitis: Causes, Symptoms, and TreatmentPeritonitis is a problem with the peritoneum, a moist tissue around the inside of the belly wall. Usually, the reaction is due to it becoming infected by microbes such as bacteria.

Peritonitis is a serious and urgent problem that doctors need to treat as soon as possible. Symptoms that could mean peritonitis include sudden, severe belly pain.

Infection is often caused by a rupture, or ""perforation."" One example of this is when appendicitis develops into a ruptured appendix. When this happens, pus from the infection bursts from the gut into the peritoneum.

Peritonitis is a serious problem that needs urgent medical attention in a nearby emergency room or by calling an ambulance. Patients who develop peritonitis while already in the hospital need attending to urgently.

Sudden, severe stomach pain that gets worse is the main symptom of peritonitis.

Symptoms of infection or inflammation because of peritonitis include the following. Some are related to serious effects in the body such as dehydration and shock caused by peritonitis:

Whether these symptoms turn out to be from peritonitis or something else, it is important to get medical help.

The first thing doctors will want to do with such symptoms is to rule out, or treat, anything potentially life-threatening like peritonitis.

A swollen belly can also be a symptom of peritonitis. When a rupture is the cause of peritonitis, fluid moves to the belly cavity and the bowel. This results in loss of fluid from the rest of the body. This is what causes the worst dehydration effects of peritonitis.

When liver disease is behind peritonitis, a swollen belly occurs for a different reason.

Here, the fluid swelling in the belly is caused by liver disease that has become infected. This is usually without the perforation that is seen in other types of peritonitis. This is known spontaneous bacterial peritonitis.

This form of peritonitis has different symptoms. The symptoms of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis are mostly discomfort, caused by the pressure of the increased fluid. For people with liver disease whose swollen bellies get infected, the pain is mild to moderate, not severe.

If peritonitis is not diagnosed quickly, lack of treatment can lead to more dangerous conditions such as sepsis and septic shock. This is why peritonitis is a medical emergency - it can quickly become life-threatening.

The abdominal cavity contains the main parts of the gut such as the stomach and intestines and other organs such as the liver and kidneys.

The peritoneum lines the belly or abdominal wall, but also forms a number of folds that go inward. By folding in, the peritoneum weaves between abdominal organs and gives them a covering membrane.

In this way, the peritoneum holds the insides of the belly in their places.

The folds of the peritoneum also contain blood and nerve supplies. These vessels can be seen running through the curtain of membrane holding together the intestines.

Most cases of peritonitis are caused by infections. In rare cases, these can be in the peritoneum itself. Most commonly, infections come from another source.

A rupture in the gut is often the source of an infection. Ruptures can come from a burst appendix, or from a hole created by a severe stomach ulcer, among other causes.

People on a type of kidney dialysis that involves filling the peritoneum with fluid and exchanging this can also get an infection from outside the body.

Other possible causes include:

Peritonitis can happen to people who have excess fluid in their bellies because of long-standing disease, liver disease especially. This is one of the less common causes.

While it is uncommon, the peritoneum can also be affected by cancer.

Anyone with symptoms that might be due to peritonitis should see a doctor as soon as possible. Peritonitis is serious, but the symptoms are also important to manage whatever their cause.

The first step with diagnosis is for doctors to ask questions. This helps them narrow down the exact type, timing, and location of symptoms.

Sometimes, the signs of peritonitis are more obvious to doctors. A patient having peritoneal dialysis for kidney disease, for example, will be at risk of infection brought through the belly wall. The dialysis will be monitored for how the exchanged fluid looks. Doctors may diagnose and treat peritonitis straight away if this fluid is cloudy.

For any suspected peritonitis, doctors check the signs by doing a physical examination, looking at the belly in particular.

Further investigations are made to check for infection or locate the source of the problem. These tests might include:

Fluid around the peritoneum may be drawn from the belly and tested for signs of inflammation and infection. This is called paracentesis.

Excess fluid in the belly fills the spaces between the folds of the peritoneum membrane. This means it fills the abdominal cavity between the organs. Doctors call this condition ascites. The fluid is called ascitic fluid.

Testing includes sending off the sample for white cell counts and chemical analysis. The lab can also look for bacteria and other microbes under the microscope, or by using stains and cultures.

Not all cases are suitable for the paracentesis test. When it is done, a thin needle is inserted into the belly skin and through the abdominal wall. Preparation is done to ensure that:

Having fluid in the belly may be the reason for being seen in the hospital in the first place. This fluid is more likely for people who have liver disease, and many can get peritonitis.

According to a paper given at the 2010 annual scientific meeting of the American College of Gastroenterologists, spontaneous bacterial peritonitis is found in some 20 percent of people admitted to hospital with ascites because of liver cirrhosis.

Peritonitis is not always preventable, and it can happen without warning. However, some cases are preventable.

Good hygiene practices in hospitals are important. This is especially true for those people with kidney disease who have the peritoneal form of dialysis where infections could be introduced into the belly.

Quick action is also preventive. People should call for medical help if very severe stomach pain comes on.

If a gut perforation is the cause, acting quickly could prevent peritonitis from developing. Quick treatment is important in any case.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Medical News Today: Soluble corn fiber may improve women's bone health","Two studies have shown that soluble corn fiber supplements can help build and retain calcium in the bones of adolescent and postmenopausal women.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312572.php","Sat, 27 Aug 2016 00:00:00 PDT","Nutrition / Diet","Soluble corn fiber may improve women's bone healthSoluble corn fiber (SCF) is a nondigestible carbohydrate used in foods and beverages such as cereals, baked goods, candy, dairy products, frozen foods, carbonated beverages, and flavored water.

SCF helps create packaged food products that have lower sugar contents, while providing a valuable source of dietary fiber.

Evidence suggests that SCF has many of the same health benefits associated with intact dietary fiber found in grains, vegetables, legumes, and fruit. SCF may improve intestinal regularity and has prebiotic properties. Moreover, SCF supports healthy blood glucose control and supports bone health by increasing calcium absorption.

The daily recommended fiber intake for adults in the United States is 25 grams for women and 38 grams for men. However, most Americans consume around half of the recommended amount. Fiber-enriched foods help bridge the shortage of fiber in the diet without significantly increasing calorie content.

In the new research, the team aimed to evaluate how the dose of SCF affected calcium absorption, bone properties, and gut microbiome in adolescent and postmenopausal women.

""We are looking deeper in the gut to build healthy bone in girls and help older women retain strong bones during an age when they are susceptible to fractures,"" says Connie Weaver, distinguished professor and head of nutrition science.

""Soluble corn fiber, a prebiotic, helps the body better utilize calcium during both adolescence and postmenopause. The gut microbiome is the new frontier in health,"" she adds.

Tate & Lyle Ingredients America LLC funded the research, and they produce Promitor Dietary Fiber, which is a soluble prebiotic fiber made from corn that is labeled as ""soluble corn fiber"" or ""maltodextrin"" on the packaging.

Findings from the study on postmenopausal women were published in American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, while the findings on adolescent women were published in Journal of Nutrition.

Weaver and colleagues found that after prebiotic fiber passes through the gut for the microbes in the lower gut to digest, the SCF is broken down into short-chain fatty acids, which assist in the maintenance bone health.

In the postmenopausal study, 14 healthy postmenopausal women consumed 0 grams, 10 grams, or 20 grams of SCF every day for 50 days. The women in the groups that received 10 grams and 20 grams - amounts that are found in supplement form - displayed bone calcium retention improvement by 4.8 percent and 7 percent, respectively.

""If projected out for a year, this would equal and counter the average rate of bone loss in a post-menopausal woman,"" says Weaver, an expert in mineral bioavailability, calcium metabolism, botanicals and bone health.

In the adolescent study, 28 girls aged between 11-14 years old consumed either 0 grams, 10 grams, or 20 grams of SCF every day for 4 weeks, while maintaining their regular diet. The females in both the 10 gram and 20 gram SCF groups saw an increase in calcium absorption by around 12 percent, which would build 1.8 percent more skeleton per year.

Gastrointestinal symptoms were minimal in both studies and the same was seen in the control groups.

""Most studies looking at benefits from soluble corn fiber are trying to solve digestion problems, and we are the first to determine that this relationship of feeding certain kind of fiber can alter the gut microbiome in ways that can enhance health,"" Weaver said. ""We found this prebiotic can help healthy people use minerals better to support bone health.""

Few people meet the daily recommended intake of 1,200 milligrams of calcium for healthy bone mass.

Weaver says that while SCF can help people better utilize calcium for bone health, this finding does not mean the recommendation to drink milk and follow a well-balanced diet should be ignored. SCF can, however, help individuals that are not consuming the whole recommended amount of dairy.

Further studies by the team will examine the mechanisms behind how SCF boosts calcium absorption and retention, and if the prebiotic fiber benefits the body in other ways.

"Medical News Today: Marijuana use leads to laziness, study suggests","Rats given THC - a psychoactive compound in marijuana - were less willing to complete a difficult cognitive task in order to receive a greater reward.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312580.php","Fri, 26 Aug 2016 09:00:00 PDT","Alcohol / Addiction / Illegal Drugs","Marijuana use leads to laziness, study suggestsLead study author Mason Silveira, of the Department of Psychology at Columbia, and colleagues report their findings in the Journal of Psychiatry and Neuroscience.

According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA), marijuana is the most commonly used illicit drug in the United States; a 2014 survey found more than 22 million Americans reported using the drug in the past month.

However, as of June 2016, 25 U.S. states and Washington, D.C., have legalized marijuana for medical or recreational use, and more states are expected to follow suit. This highlights the need to gain a better understanding of the risks and benefits marijuana use may pose.

A sense of euphoria, increased appetite, heightened sensory perception, hallucinations and delusions, and fear and anxiety are some of the well-known effects of marijuana use. Such effects are primarily down to the two main active compounds - known as cannabinoids - in the drug: tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD).

There is a common belief that marijuana use can also affect a person's motivation, making them lazy, though there has been little scientific evidence to support this association.

Silveira and colleagues note that previous studies have suggested the activation of cannabinoid receptors - which occurs through marijuana use - can affect decision-making related to physical effort, making a person physically lazy.

It is unclear, however, whether decision-making related to cognitive effort is affected in the same way. Silveira and colleagues wanted to find out.

The researchers trained 29 male rats to complete a behavioral experiment, whereby the animals had to decide whether they wanted to complete an easy or difficult cognitive task in order to receive a reward; the more difficult challenge produced a higher reward.

The easy task required the rats to react to a light that flashed for 1 second, which earned them one sugar pellet. In the difficult task, the rats had to react to a light that flashed for only 0.2 seconds, which gave them two sugar pellets.

The rats completed the experiment under normal conditions, as well as after being given THC and CBD independently and combined.

As expected, under normal conditions, the rats opted for the more difficult task, earning them a higher reward.

However, after being given THC, the rats opted for the easier task, even though it earned them fewer treats.

After being given CBD alone, the team identified no difference in rats' task choices.

Following administration of THC and CBD combined, however, the team was surprised by the results. Previous research had suggested that CBD can counteract the negative effects of THC, but this was not the case in the current study - both cannabinoids combined led the rats to opt for the easy task.

The team explains the findings further in the video below:

The researchers say their findings demonstrate the negative effect marijuana use may have on cognitive effort; put simply, the results show that using marijuana could make a person cognitively lazy, which could reduce their chances of successful life outcomes.

""Although a chronic dosing experiment would be required to assess this association directly, we hypothesize that associations between THC and poorer life outcomes may be due to a drug-induced decrease in willingness to allocate cognitive effort, rather than impairments in fundamental cognitive abilities per se,"" they add.

The authors conclude that further research is warranted to determine the underlying mechanisms by which THC alters decision-making. Such information could lead to ways to block the negative effects of THC, while maintaining the medical benefits, such as pain relief.

"Medical News Today: Reducing prescription opioid addiction by switching receptors","Addiction to opioid painkillers has risen rapidly over the last decade. Could its addictive power be reduced by switching to a different receptor subtype?","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312568.php","Fri, 26 Aug 2016 08:00:00 PDT","Alcohol / Addiction / Illegal Drugs","Reducing prescription opioid addiction by switching receptorsOpioid pain medication is extremely effective, but, unfortunately, it is also highly addictive.

Since 1999, the number of prescriptions for opioid painkillers in the United States has quadrupled, despite there being no change in the number of reported pain cases.

According to the American Society of Addiction Medicine, there were 18,893 overdose deaths related to opioid painkillers in America in 2014.

From 1999-2010, deaths due to opioid painkiller overdoses rose 400 percent in women and 237 percent in men.

Opioid painkillers produce brain abnormalities that lead to dependence and addiction. Dependence can be relieved after a few days or weeks away from the medication; the changes related to addiction, however, are more complex and long-lasting.

Relapses can occur months or even years after dependence has gone.

The factors behind this type of long-lasting addictive behavior include a genetic predisposition to drug-liking, the social context of the initial experience with opioids, psychological factors, and more as yet unknown influences.

As the death toll rises, the solution to this deadly problem has not been forthcoming. Pain medication is essential for millions of people and a safer, yet equally effective alternative to opioid painkillers does not yet exist.

Researchers from the University of Texas Health Science Center in San Antonio recently published work investigating an innovative new approach to the problem.

Current opioids specifically target mu opioid receptors, including the ones in the brain - hence the potential for abuse. Jeske, with first author Allison Doyle Brackley and their team, set out to investigate the possibility of targeting receptors outside of the brain.

In animal studies, drugs targeting delta opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system (outside of the brain and spinal cord) produce fewer side effects and have a significantly lower potential for abuse.

The problem with delta opioid receptors is that they only become activated during inflammation. This stumbling block has limited the amount of research into opioids that specifically target peripheral delta receptors.

The researchers found that a protein - GRK2 (G protein-coupled receptor kinase 2) - binds to delta opioid receptors in the sensory neurons of rats; this binding prevents them from becoming active. However, when these receptors came into contact with an inflammatory molecule that is normally released in response to an injury - bradykinin - this binding changed.

Bradykinin caused GRK2 to move away from the delta receptors, triggering a biochemical reaction that resulted in the receptors regaining their function.

Additionally, the team found that rats with lower levels of GRK2 in peripheral sensory neurons found pain relief from a delta opioid-targeted drug, without the need for an inflammatory trigger.

This study adds to medical science's understanding of GRK2's functions. It is the first time that its inhibitory effect on delta opioid receptors in the peripheral nervous system has been seen.

The findings will need to be replicated in human tissue, but the findings could open the door to a new approach to pain medication. In the long run, innovations of this type have the potential to save thousands of lives.

"Medical News Today: Diabetes-related vision loss growing worldwide","The number of people worldwide with vision loss from diabetic retinopathy is rising, representing an increasing proportion of the blind and sight-impaired.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312564.php","Fri, 26 Aug 2016 07:00:00 PDT","Eye Health / Blindness","Diabetes-related vision loss growing worldwideThese figures are the result of an analysis by a global consortium, who recently published their work online in the journal Diabetes Care.

As the number of people living with diabetes worldwide grows, so does the chance that more people will develop diabetic retinopathy and suffer subsequent vision loss, especially if they do not receive or adhere to the care they need.

Diabetic retinopathy is a disease of the retina that damages sight as a result of chronic high blood sugar in diabetes. The high sugar damages the delicate blood vessels in the retina - the light-sensitive layer of tissue that lines the back of the eye.

As the damage increases, the blood vessels begin to leak and distort vision. In people with advanced diabetic retinopathy, new, abnormal blood vessels grow in the retina, causing further damage and eventually permanent scarring and vision loss or blindness.

Lead author Janet Leasher, associate professor of the College of Optometry at Nova Southeastern University in Fort Lauderdale, FL, says:

""Unfortunately diabetic retinopathy usually does not have any symptoms in the early stages.""

Thus, it is important that people with diabetes have their eyes tested every year, follow the advice of their eye health practitioner, and make sure they keep their blood sugar under control.

The researchers suggest poor control of blood glucose and inadequate access to eye health services in many parts of the world are contributing to the rising numbers of people with diabetes-related vision loss.

For their investigation, the researchers carried out a meta-analysis of published population studies from 1990-2012 for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2010. A meta-analysis is where you pool data from several studies of similar design and analyze it as if it came from one large study.

The researchers extracted and pooled data on diabetic retinopathy to produce estimates of global regional trends on the condition as a cause of moderate and severe vision impairment and blindness.

They found that over the period 1990-2010, South Asia, Middle East and North Africa, and West Sub-Saharan Africa, were the regions with the highest number of people with visual impairment due to diabetic retinopathy, while East Asia, Tropical Latin America, and South Sub-Saharan Africa had the highest number of people rendered blind by the condition.

The biggest rise in the proportion of the over-50s population whose vision impairment was due to diabetic retinopathy occurred in Central, South, and Tropical Latin America, while South Sub-Saharan Africa, Southern Latin America, and Central Sub-Saharan Africa had the biggest rise in the proportion of over-50s rendered blind by the condition.

The researchers found a slight fall in visual impairment due to diabetic retinopathy occurred in South and Southeast Asia, Oceania, and East and West Sub-Saharan Africa.

Lead investigator Rupert R.A. Bourne, professor and associate director of the Vision and Eye Research Unit at Anglia Ruskin University in the United Kingdom, says:

""With the alarming prevalence of vision loss due to diabetes rising more than two thirds in the last 20 years, the precipitous global epidemic of diabetes must be addressed.""

He and his colleagues suggest policymakers in the regions most affected by diabetic retinopathy should develop and implement plans for preserving the vision of diabetic adults, screen for diabetic retinopathy, and improve glucose and blood pressure in diabetics.

They should also intensify efforts to prevent and treat diabetic retinopathy - for instance, by introducing laser treatments, use of intravitreal injections of steroids, and anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) drugs.

"Medical News Today: Bacterial Pneumonia: Get the Facts","Learn all about bacterial pneumonia, an inflammation of the lungs caused by bacteria. This article looks at its causes, symptoms, diagnosis, and treatment.","http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/312565.php","Fri, 26 Aug 2016 06:00:00 PDT","Infectious Diseases / Bacteria / Viruses","Bacterial Pneumonia: Get the FactsBacterial pneumonia is an inflammation of the lungs due to some form of bacteria. There are different types of bacteria that may lead to the infection.

The lungs are made up of different sections or lobes. There are three lobes on the right and two on the left. Bacterial pneumonia can affect both lungs, one lung, or even just one section of a lung.

The lobes of the lungs are made up of small air sacs called alveoli. Normally, the air sacs fill with air. Oxygen is inhaled and carbon dioxide in exhaled.

When a person develops pneumonia, the air sacs become inflamed, which can cause them to fill with fluid. If the air sacs are filled with fluid instead of air, it can make breathing difficult. In some cases, the lungs may not get enough oxygen.

Pneumonia is often classified as either community-acquired pneumonia or hospital-acquired pneumonia. The classification refers to where a person was when they became infected. Community-acquired pneumonia is the most common type of pneumonia.

If a person develops community-acquired pneumonia, it means they were infected by bacteria outside of a hospital. Bacteria usually enter the lungs after someone breathes in particles or droplets from a sneeze or a cough from someone who has the infection.

Viruses can also cause community-acquired pneumonia. The most common causes of community-acquired pneumonia are Streptococcus pneumoniae and Haemophilus influenzae.

Hospital-acquired pneumonia occurs within a few days of being exposed to a germ in a healthcare setting, such as a hospital or nursing home. Hospital-acquired pneumonia can develop when a healthcare worker transmits germs from one patient to another.

The most common causes of hospital-acquired pneumonia are Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus.

Although anyone can develop bacterial pneumonia, there are certain factors that put a person at a higher risk.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, people who have a weakened immune system due to cancer treatment or an organ transplant are at an increased risk of developing bacterial pneumonia.

Smoking and having a long-term medical condition, such as emphysema, increases the risk. Being over 65 and having recent surgery also puts people at a higher risk.

Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia can vary in severity. Some people only have mild symptoms while others develop life-threatening complications.

According to the American Lung Association, typical symptoms of bacterial pneumonia include:

Symptoms of bacterial pneumonia tend to be similar in both children and adults. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, toddlers and infants may cry more than usual, be less energetic, and appear pale.

If a person thinks they have symptoms of pneumonia, they should see their doctor. If an individual has symptoms of pneumonia, it's tough to determine the cause without seeing a physician.

Since bacterial pneumonia is treated differently to viral pneumonia, it's important to find the cause so that appropriate treatment is given.

Complications from bacterial pneumonia can occur in both children and adults. Anyone can develop complications from bacterial pneumonia, but people with a weakened immune system and the elderly are at a higher risk.

Complications may include the following:

A diagnosis of bacterial pneumonia is made after various diagnostic tests and a physical exam is completed. During a physical exam, the doctor will listen to the lungs to determine if they sound abnormal.

In most cases, a chest X-ray will be done to check for areas of inflammation or fluid in the lungs.

Additional tests may also be performed, such as a CT scan and an arterial blood gas. A blood gas measures the amount of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the blood. It helps determine how well a person is breathing and exchanging gasses.

A bronchoscopy may be performed to look into the lungs and also obtain a sample of mucus. The procedure is done by inserting a small tube with a tiny camera through the mouth into the lungs. The patient is given medication to numb their throat and relax.

Treatment for bacterial pneumonia includes antibiotics, which target the specific bacteria causing the infection. Medications to make breathing easier may also be prescribed.

Additional medications may include over-the-counter drugs to ease aches and pains and reduce fever. Home care will often include rest and drinking plenty of fluids unless otherwise instructed by a doctor. It's also important to finish a course of antibiotics as prescribed even if symptoms have improved.

Some people may require hospitalization for bacterial pneumonia. Hospitalization may be required if someone needs oxygen, has dehydration, or needs breathing assistance with a ventilator.

People who develop complications may also require additional treatments that involve being hospitalized. As a precaution, those at an increased risk of complications may also be hospitalized so they can be monitored closely. These groups include people over 65 or under 2 months.

One of the best ways to prevent bacterial pneumonia is by keeping the immune system working well. Eating healthy foods, getting enough rest, and frequent handwashing are good ways to start.

Since bacterial pneumonia can develop as a complication of the flu, getting an annual flu shot may prevent pneumonia.

A pneumococcal vaccine is also available that may reduce a person's chances of developing bacterial pneumonia. The vaccine protects against S. pneumoniae bacteria, which are often a cause of bacterial pneumonia.

The vaccine is often recommended for adults over 65 and children between 6 weeks and 5 years.

In addition to bacteria, pneumonia can also be caused by viruses and fungi. Regardless of the cause, symptoms of pneumonia are often similar.

Because symptoms are similar in people who have viral and bacterial pneumonia, it makes it difficult to determine the cause at first.

According to the Cleveland Clinic, symptoms of bacterial pneumonia tend to be more severe than viral pneumonia and often come on suddenly. Symptoms of viral pneumonia tend to come on slower and are similar to the flu at first.

One way to tell the difference between viral and bacterial pneumonia is a mucus sample. A mucus sample is coughed up or sucked out of the lungs and analyzed under a microscope to determine if any bacteria are present.

Supportive treatment for pneumonia, such as oxygen and fever-reducing medicine is often the same whether the cause is viral or bacterial. The main difference in treatment is that antibiotics are needed to treat bacterial pneumonia.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Flutiform fails to hit targets in COPD trial","UK group Vectura saw its shares drop 10 percent after partner Munipharma reported that respiratory drug flutiform failed to hit targets in a late-stage trial involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.","http://www.pharmatimes.com/news/flutiform_fails_to_hit_targets_in_copd_trial_1117291","Wed, 31 Aug 2016 07:36:47 +0100","NA","UK group Vectura saw its shares drop 10 percent after partner Munipharma reported that respiratory drug flutiform failed to hit targets in a late-stage trial involving patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

The Phase III trial missed its primary endpoint of demonstrating statistically significant superiority in the reduction of annualised rates of moderate and severe COPD exacerbations in patients taking flutiform compared to those taking mono-component long-acting beta 2 agonist (LABA) treatment alone.

Flutiform combines fluticasone propionate (fluticasone), an inhaled corticosteroid, and formoterol fumarate, an LABA, in a single aerosol inhaler incorporating Vectura's SkyeDry technology, acquired through its purchase of SkyePharma and approved for asthma. Mundipharma holds marketing rights to the drug for most of the world outside North America and Japan.

Investors will be disappointed with the news because the trial was intended to support expanding the drug's approved uses in Europe to include COPD, which is now looking unlikely.

""Whilst this result is disappointing, flutiform continues to grow strongly based on the approved asthma indication, which continues to underpin our expectations for future growth of the product,"" noted James Ward-Lilley, Vectura's chief executive.

""Vectura already benefits from sizeable and growing revenues from other partnered products on the market in Europe and elsewhere for the treatment of COPD, including Ultibro and Seebri,"" he added.","Healthcare"

The study assessed Praluent (alirocumab) injection in patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) who require regular weekly or bi-weekly apheresis, an invasive procedure designed to remove 'bad' cholesterol from the blood.

This treatment can cost between  17,000 to  31,000 for each patient per year in the UK and, while around 200 people in the country are eligible, only 30-40 patients receive apheresis each year.

In the study, despite being treated with apheresis and entering the trial with very high 'bad' cholesterol levels (mean of 4.7 mmol/L), 63 percent of patients treated with Praluent no longer required the procedure after six weeks of receiving the drug.

At this same time point, the average 'bad' cholesterol level among the alirocumab-treated group was 2.3 mmol/L compared to 4.8 mmol/L in the placebo group, thus falling under the recommended target cholesterol level.

Other key findings, presented at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2016 and published in the European Heart Journal, were that 93 percent of patients in the Praluent arm experienced at least a 50 percent reduction in their apheresis procedures, and that, throughout the trial, patients treated with the drug experienced significant reductions in their LDL cholesterol compared to placebo, starting at week six (55 percent greater reduction), and lasting until the trial ended, at week 18 (46 percent greater reduction).

The two arms of the trial also exhibited similar safety profiles, the firms noted, further raising hopes for an effective treatment for the condition.

""Apheresis therapy is an invasive, time-consuming and expensive treatment therefore it is promising to see that alirocumab has the potential to reduce the frequency of this burdensome treatment in patients with inherited high cholesterol,"" said Dr Handrean Soran, Consultant Physician & Endocrinologist at Central Manchester University Hospitals.

Praluent was launched in the UK in October 2015, and was approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence for NHS use to treat certain patients with high cholesterol in June this year.","Healthcare"

The UK-wide team, led by the Asthma UK Centre for Applied Research at The University of Edinburgh, looked at information from national health surveys and anonymised administrative, health and social care records to help construct an accurate picture of the burden of the condition.

The findings, published in the journal BMC Medicine, reveal that there were around 6.4 million GP and nurse consultations for asthma each year, and that more 270 people are admitted to hospital every day because of asthma attacks.

The research also revealed that at least  666 million is spent on asthma-related prescription each year, while  160 million goes on GP consultations,  143 million on disability claims and  137 million on hospital care.

However, the team also noted that the figures are likely to be ""substantial underestimates"" given that people for whom asthma was not their main illness were not included in the research.

""Even with conservative assumptions, we find almost 100,000 people are admitted to hospital and there are at least 1000 deaths from asthma each year in the UK,"" said Professor Aziz Sheikh, director of the Centre.

""This is unacceptable for a condition that, for most people, can be managed effectively with the right support from their GP,"" he stressed, and called for a greater focus on primary care to cut rates of related attacks, hospitalisations and deaths.

The researchers note that, given the vast amount of money streamed into preventative treatments for asthma, ""particular focus is warranted on primary care to assess whether the most effective and cost-effective treatment strategies are consistently being employed, and on the development of innovative strategies for the prevention and early detection of asthma attacks"".","Healthcare"

The finding has prompted renewed calls for improved foot care; experts estimate that four out of five amputations can be prevented as 80 percent begin as foot ulcers which are largely avoidable and treatable it detected early.

On the plus side, the major amputation rate (amputations above the ankle) has dipped slightly since Diabetes UK launched the Putting Feet First campaign in 2012, but the charity said it is alarmed that the variation rates between the best and the worst performing areas of the country continue to widen.

Those areas more successful in tackling diabetes-related amputation continue to lower their rates, whereas the rate for the worst performing has not dropped in the last year, it said, and called for ""targeted action"" to help address this variation.

The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence has published updated guidelines backing Esmya (ulipristal) - a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) which acts by blocking receptors of the hormone progesterone - after clinical trials showed that it provides rapid control of bleeding, reduces anaemia and shrinks the size of fibroids.

Doctors can now prescribe up to four courses of the drug as a first-line treatment for patients presenting with heavy menstrual bleeding and uterine fibroids 3cm or more in diameter.

Around 40 in every 100 women develop uterine fibroids at some time in their life, and it is estimated that about 300,000 surgical procedures are performed annually in the EU for fibroids, including around 230,000 hysterectomies, which can affect a women's ability to have children.

In addition, surgical treatments are expensive for the NHS, having cost NHS England  119 million last year alone, so the availability of an alternative option could help save a substantial amount of cash.

""Uterine fibroids are extremely common and a significant proportion of women will experience associated symptoms, which can include heavy menstrual bleeding and severe pain"" said Mr Ertan Saridogan, Consultant Gynaecologist, University College Hospital and The Portland Hospital.

The clinical model at the hospital for child emergency services - implemented as part of the Mid Staffordshire NHS Trust Special Administrator recommendations - has been deemed currently unviable, following a number of safety concerns highlighted in a draft report by the West Midlands Quality Review Service (WMQRS).

""I fully appreciate the impact these temporary changes will have on families in Stafford and the surrounding area, and understand that people will be very concerned about this news,"" said Liz Rix, chief nurse and acting deputy chief executive. ""However, we cannot and will not continue to deliver services without the confidence that those services are safe.""

In a statement, Dr Clifford Mann, president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, said the move is ""regrettable but sensible as inadequate staffing could potentially put patients at risk"".

""The decision is one that no-one wants, especially patients, but a course of action that is being forced on managers. All of the stories we have seen over recent weeks have one common theme   a lack of staff. There simply aren't enough doctors at a national level to cope with demand.

Data from the Phase III EXPAND trial, which assessed the efficacy and safety the oral once-daily drug in secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS), met its primary endpoint of reducing the risk of disability progression compared with placebo. Information on secondary targets has not been disclosed at this time.

""SPMS is a particularly disabling form of MS, and there is a need for effective treatment options to help delay disability progression in those living with the condition,"" said Vasant Narasimhan, Novartis' chief medical officer. ""The positive EXPAND data are encouraging for a disease with such a high unmet need"".

Most people with relapsing remitting forms of MS will eventually go on to develop SPMS; on average, around 65 percent will develop SPMS 15 years after being diagnosed, according to the MS Society.

Siponimod is a selective modulator of specific types of the sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) receptor, which is commonly found on the surface of specific cells in the central nervous system that are responsible for causing damage that drives loss of function in SPMS.

The drug enters the brain binding to these specific receptors, which may prevent the activation of these harmful cells, helping to reduce loss of physical and cognitive function associated with SPMS, the firm said.

Novartis will now complete a full analyses of the data and ""evaluate next steps in consultation with health authorities"", and also plans to share top-line data at the ECTRIMS congress in London next month.","Healthcare"

The provider sector is showing an overall deficit of  461 million in the quarter, which is  5 million better than the planned deficit and ""in marked contrast to recent years,"" the regulator said.

Of the 214 trusts that accepted control totals, 185 met their quarterly funding targets, giving them access to payments from the Sustainability and Transformation Fund, a  1.8-billion cash pot designed to help trusts reduce deficits.

According to the latest quarterly performance report, providers are ""tightening their financial grip"" and the provider pay bill is  9.8 million better than planned, helped by crack down in agency staff costs which has saved around  500 million compared to predicted spend over the period.

""This is a crucial year for the NHS. Today's results have demonstrated that providers are up for the challenge and are starting to get a grip on their finances. It's early days - and there is still much work to be done - but today's figures demonstrate that providers are meeting some of the ambitious plans that trusts boards have signed up to and this is a promising start to the year,"" noted Jim Mackey, chief executive of NHS Improvement.

""The demands on the NHS are extremely high, with waiting times struggling to hit targets, and patient numbers set to increase during the winter months. We must therefore move forward with caution, but it is clear that finance directors are tackling the challenge head on and setting good foundations for the coming year.""

Richard Murray, director of policy at The King's Fund, welcomed the reports finding that new investment and actions taken to tackle overspending have reduced deficits, but stressed that ""it would be a mistake to suggest that the financial pressures which have engulfed the NHS have eased"".

""While overall NHS trusts met their financial targets in the first quarter, our new survey of NHS finance directors shows only a third are confident this will be the case by the end of the year. It also shows a worrying decline in confidence among commissioners, with twice as many clinical commissioning groups forecasting end-of-year deficits than at this time last year.""

He also argued that ""demand for services is rising rapidly, waiting times are continuing to worsen and NHS leaders have been charged with delivering significant changes to services,"" and that while extra investment and staff efforts mean that NHS organisations just about coping for the time being, ""the service is reaching a critical point"".

Stephen Dalton, head of the NHS Confederation, said the early figures are ""encouraging"", but cautioned that it is too soon ""to determine whether extra money this year will genuinely help providers become more financially stable.""

The biotech giant is seeking approval for the drug to treat the condition in adult patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) who are receiving haemodialysis.

But after reviewing the data the US Food and Drug Administration has issued the firm with a Complete Response Letter turning down its application.

The contents have not been revealed, but Amgen says it anticipates a post-action meeting with the FDA later this year to discuss its response.

Secondary HPT is a common, serious and often progressive condition among patients with CKD. It develops in response to declining kidney function, when the parathyroid (PTH) glands increase the production of thyroid to maintain normal levels of calcium and phosphorus.

However, eventually this excess production is not enough to maintain normal levels, and at the point of CKD dialysis, this manifests as abnormal amounts of PTH, calcium and phosphorus that, in turn, can lead to significant clinical consequences, such as weakness and thinning of the bones.

Parsabiv (etelcalcetide) is a novel calcimimetic agent that suppresses the secretion of PTH by binding to and activating the calcium-sensing receptor on the parathyroid gland. The treatment is given intravenously three times per week at the end of each dialysis session.

The submission is based on data from three Phase III studies, one of which showed that 74 percent of patients given the drug experienced a greater than 30 percent reduction from baseline in PTH compared with 8.3 percent in the placebo arm.","Healthcare"

Eighty-two percent of 441 GPs responding to the survey said drug shortages had forced them to prescribe a second-choice medicine in the past 12 months, and 18 percent of these said patients had experienced a negative effect - an adverse event or reduced efficacy - as a result.

""The issue of secure drug supply is an on-going problem that no one has been able to adequately address,"" said Andrew Green, chairman of the GPC clinical and prescribing subcommittee. ""Sometimes problems can be very localised, so you can have difficulties in one part of the country and not in others. That makes informing GPs really quite a difficult task to do"".

He went on to note that GPs usually only know of drug shortages when patients return because they were unable to get their prescription, and suggested doctors might welcome a central alert system to warn of low stocks.

Drug shortages in branded medicines, which occur when demand is outstripping supply, are caused by various reasons including manufacturing problems, medicine recalls, safety concerns or parallel exports.

""The reasons for instances of medicines shortages are often both complex and varied and we have consistently worked with our members, the Department of Health and others, including regulators, wholesalers, pharmacists and parallel distributors, in order to minimise any impact on patients,"" said Dr Rick Greville, ABPI Director, Wales and Distribution & Supply.

The drug has been recommended for use - within its marketing authorisation - as an option for metastatic colorectal cancer in adults who have had previous treatments including fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin- or irinotecan-based chemotherapies, anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) agents and anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) agents, or when these therapies are not suitable.

After applying end-of-life considerations to the appraisal, NICE concluded that, as a third  or subsequent line treatment for metastatic colorectal cancer, Lonsurf (trifluridine/tipiracil) represents a well tolerated treatment that would help extend life by even a relatively short time, while maintaining a reasonably good quality of life at a late stage in the treatment pathway when there are no further options left.

Data from the Phase III RECOURSE study a statistically significant improvement in overall survival (OS) in patients taking the drug versus best standard of care, the median OS improving from 5.2 months 7.2 months, while one-year survival rates were 27.1 percent and 16.6 percent, respectively.

According to Servier, NICE backing for the drug comes at a time when there is a real need for further treatment options for patients with refractory metastatic colorectal cancer. ""With the changing funding landscape for oncology agents within the UK, the addition of new products in later lines of therapy could be crucial to those patients"".

""There are not many options left when a patient has had previous treatments,"" noted Dr Rob Glynne Jones, consultant oncologist and Macmillan Lead Clinician in Gastrointestinal Cancer at the Mount Vernon Cancer Centre. ""Lonsurf is potentially a valuable new drug that I can offer to my patients with metastatic colorectal cancer regardless of their RAS status or resistance to previous lines of treatment. It's great news that NICE has recommended Lonsurf   because I now have a treatment that could give my patients some extra time"".

Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of cancer related deaths in the UK and Europe; in 2012, 215,000 people died from the disease across Europe, 16,200 (44/day) of whom were from the UK, highlighting a high level of unmet need in the treatment of the disease.","Healthcare"

A growing segment of the workforce prefers it, and it saves huge spend on real estate and related costs. But lagging behind the rapid technology expansion is well thought through organizational strategy to absolutely ensure that remote workers are as productive and as engaged as their in-house counterparts. Also, that processes are compliant  and security risks are maintained with the various mobile technologies.

Who are your mobile workers?

Not every job is a good fit for remote work. Expectations and output should be clearly defined, contracted, highly visible and discussed with frequency. Roles that require extensive think tanking and brainstorming (greater than 50%) might be better served in an office environment. Jobs that require less than 50% face-to-face collaboration with other colleagues for output are a good match for remote work.

Is there a certain  personality type  that will thrive in a remote environment? People that are accustomed to and prefer autonomy certainly drive the success rate, and a strong technical aptitude is recommended, given IT is no longer down the hall. Beyond that, innovative companies develop self-assessment tools for employees as a first step in the process (with company requirements included). The fit for employees is personal, and when possible, their nomination as step one mitigates risk of poor performance or dissatisfaction. The majority of applicants and employees will disqualify themselves - long before you ever have to - with a well assembled self-assessment.

High powered connectivity and visibility of others is compulsory. Think of it as replacing your office landscape the place where people work together (formal and informal), learn from each other (formal and informal), and socialize. A social platform (Chatter, Yammer, Work.com or Socialcast) becomes the all-in-one place where work and ideas are exchanged, updates are issued, colleagues are recognized, and problems get solved. A second best practice is the use of video for one to one and team meetings. Video mitigates the risk of  missing out  on the power of face-to-face interactions.

Mobile gear and technologies are available in all shapes and sizes, and pass muster of most security requirements. The last bit of effort needs to be invested in comprehensive, low-effort connection of your people broadly and deeply, making work easy to get done, from just about anywhere.

It s really only the beginning. The use of the data will continue and in 10, 20 years from now people will be doing different things with the data than we ever imagined.  Michael Kinsella of Servier

Industry stakeholders have insisted that it could be a costly mistake to view serialisation as a project which only concerns engineering matters. As serialisation data is unique to the pack it requires not only the deployment of new treatment but also expanded staff investment and stakeholder engagement. Therefore,  To characterize it as an engineering issue is therefore to grossly underestimate its consequences, which touch virtually every business function in pharmaceutical manufacturing. 2

The updating of hardware for packaging lines may on first appearances seem to be a usual project comprising of routine timescales and considerations. However, some cases in the market have conveyed that installing and commissioning integrated serialisation ready hardware ends up being considerably more complex than first assumed. 2 New equipment capabilities have to be met in response to data requirements  including multi-substrate inks for TIJ printers and printer abilities to perform to aggregation and verification.

Effective data management is imperative to achieve regulatory compliance with a serialisation programme. Non-standard data exchange and integration methods are seen as one of the biggest hurdles in serialisation compliance.4 These projects will also incur a surge in the amount of data shared between trading partners, with the volume of data units being determined by the length of the supply chain in question.

In light of the data responsibilities expected within serialisation projects, Pharma IQ consults with a selection of experts on software best practices - data integration and implementation.

Download the early draft agenda for the Serialisation and Traceability Event  taking place from 02-04 November, 2016 in Geneva, Switzerland. Download the agenda here

Pharma firms should have a clear map of their current and their target architecture, due to the evolving ecosystem that operates in many pharma companies. Michael Kinsella, Program Director, Serialisation & Traceability at Servier notes that the pharma firm is currently rolling out a SAP implementation at their main sites simultaneously alongside other rationalisation projects concerning historical IT systems.

So, here, a clear roadmap is imperative to ensure Servier is synchronized with their master data requirements to fulfill the needs in a timely fashion.

In response to partnership interaction with CMOs, Michael Kinsella from Servier noted:  The CMO area is quite tricky and it s often left until the last step because there is a lot of hesitancy about specifying  responsibilities. Who s going to pay for the interfaces? You may even have equipment that needs to be put into the CMOs to perform some of the data exchanges, you may need scanners, you may need relabeling, you may need reprinting or re-aggregation capabilities in order to be able to send data back to a mother system and to maintain the integrity. So it s really quite complex.  He adds that assessing CMO interaction is often underestimated. CMOs usually wait for the client to explain their needs, as it is the pharma companies who hold the marketing authorizations that are under the obligation to ensure boxes leave the factories in a conforming manner.

Depending on the responsibility or the contract held between various partners or the pharmaceutical company, it is not always completely clear what kind of investments the CMOs need to make and the interfaces they are responsible for.

 I think the first steps are not the specification of the interface itself   but more mapping out the relationship and the responsibility the business needs. - Michael Kinsella

This will involve categorizing the partners the pharma firm has, the type of CMOs and their responsibilities and requirements. Different arrangements may occur according to the authorisation of a product or the delegation of responsibility in the production, packaging and distribution of a product. Michael notes that in some cases pharma firms may decide not to  integrate their systems into, or to interface with the CMO s systems or exchange data. They may simply connect to the national database to which the data is transmitted to. In other cases, there may be a business need to exchange data to facilitate certain business activities, especially where the product is still in the possession of the pharma firm.  If the product has left their possession or has been sold, the responsibilities for the data integrity or data exchanges change somewhat.

"The Impact of Cognitive Computing on Healthcare in Southeast Asia","Bumrungrad International Hospital is the world s first hospital to implement IBM Watson, the world s first cognitive computer.

This is a computer that can rapidly analyse the collective research and recommendations of leading professionals, in order to advise healthcare professionals and improve patient outcomes. To find out more, we speak with Dr James Miser, Chief Medical Information Officer at Bumrungrad International Hospital, who describes the implementation process so far and how the technology is likely to transform healthcare.

  To date, Watson for Oncology has compiled nearly 15 million pages of medical content, including more than 200 medical textbooks and 300 medical journals.

  Watson can assemble and assess patient information along with relevant medical information from its entire database in less than a minute.

  Watson provides medical professionals with instant access to information from leading research institutions from around the world.

  At Bumrungrad International Hospital, staff will be using Watson to make their data organization more efficient and ultimately the system will help them decide on the best course of treatment for patients.

How is cognitive computing changing the way medicine is being practised?

Dr James Miser:  Medicine is changing dramatically, in large part due to our genetic and molecular understanding of ourselves and the diseases that we can contract. In essence, we re getting more complicated to medically understand. This leads to greater quantities of patient information and the necessity for more organisation of said information, along with more disease and treatment information. 

 Within the next 5-10 years, this mass of accumulated patient, disease and treatment information is going to become dramatically more complex. In order to give patients the best treatment  options, all of that data needs to be available immediately. This represents an immense challenge for physicians all over the world. Fortunately, a cognitive computing solution is able to absorb thousands of medical journals, textbooks, papers and guidelines from leading institutions in order to piece together the most appropriate data and outline the best course of action for the patient. 

Why is this of particular importance in Southeast Asia?

Dr James Miser:  The challenges in Southeast Asia are magnified because of the uneven distribution of  healthcare throughout the region, for example, the differences between major medical centres and more rural areas. If we can address this balance with cloud based cognitive computing solutions then I think we can have more of an impact here than anywhere else. 

Dr James Miser:  It s a cloud-based system meaning that primary, secondary and tertiary care centres would all have access to it. So even if a primary care centre was unable to properly diagnose a patient or provide the suggested treatment (many cancers require molecular diagnosis with advanced technological processes), its staff would be able to accurately determine where the patient needs to be referred to, with a clear idea of what tests and potential treatments may be  necessary. 

What benefits does using Watson give your colleagues in the oncology department at present?

Dr James Miser:   We re just about to start actively using Watson, which means we re piloting it after numerous test cases. So to be honest, initially the results will be modest but over time it will become more and more important as it is used in connection with a wider variety of cancers and cancer patients, especially in complex cases where the cancer regresses and then reappears often.

 Currently, it will help doctors using the system become more efficient as it helps organise the data, combine the relevant healthcare literature, provide roadmaps and so on. All of these processes will quickly become standardised too, which will allow healthcare professionals to practise in a more efficient and timely manner. 

So it s accurate to say that the benefits delivered by Watson haven t been fully realised yet and are going to increase significantly as more healthcare professionals become used to utilising it?



Dr James Miser:   Certainly. It s also going to deliver increased benefits for patients too in terms of helping to design more effective treatment plans. By March we re hoping to be able to present more concrete data regarding this area. The key issue is ensuring the information is available across the entire healthcare network, so that each medical professional involved is properly informed and can subsequently keep the patient properly informed at every step. In this way,

everybody benefits: the hospitals and healthcare professionals benefit financially and get a boost to their reputation, but more importantly, the patients will benefit. Instead of feeling cut off from the care that they need, they can go to their local healthcare facility and receive a diagnosis and treatment plan supported by the entire hospital network s expertise based on effective dissemination of information. 

Can you give a ballpark estimate regarding how much of an impact the system will have on oncology department efficiency rates?

Dr James Miser:  Cancer diagnosis requires the completion and analysis of multiple tests which Watson can carry out for the doctor. It can gather all of the patient s data, organise it and ensure it is complete before consulting its databank of medical literature and then making a suggestion on what the best treatment might be, based on its findings. All of this can be done in perhaps less than a minute   it s more to do with the speed of the internet than anything else. Moreover, it doesn t give just the best treatment option, it also suggests the next best option, and the next, with more options available if necessary. In some cases this is more for the patient to decide, because what s best for one patient may not be best for another, like whether or not to receive chemotherapy, for example. Essentially, Watson puts all of those options, all of the relevant data, literature and several other information tools right at the doctor s fingertips. It s really going to help them make efficient, informed decisions in a much more timely manner. 

We ve been talking primarily about Watson s impact on oncology. What other applications and impacts do you see this technology having?

Dr James Miser:   I think that Watson has wider applications to health in general. It can be applied to all types of cancer but it also has applications to the treatment of any serious or chronic disease because it can keep medical professionals updated on the latest practices, treatments and therapies as they are developed 

Will the costs of implementing Watson keep it prohibitively expensive for other less well-funded medical institutions?

Dr James Miser:   Watson was certainly expensive to develop but like any technology the costs of implementing it will decrease over time. For example, initially it cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to map the human genome but now it only costs around $1000. In the same way, once Watson is applied more broadly, I imagine that the costs will decrease dramatically. There s even a case to be made by governments that its implementation will eventually save money as it improves healthcare efficiency. Ultimately, Watson can and should be implemented outside of the wealthiest institutions, because they already have the expertise, so they have less of a need for Watson s capabilities. It s in more remote and less specialised healthcare facilities in regions like South-East Asia that Watson will have the greatest impact on improving the overall health of the population and I believe that IBM and the other developers of Watson have that vision for their creation. 

What advice would you give any other healthcare organisation that is looking to integrate Watson into their existing processes?

Dr James Miser:  It s essential that you are able to link Watson to your medical staff effectively. Creating the right user interface and the right IT platform takes time, care, diligence and ICT expertise in order to create a scenario where your employees have a seamless connection to the expertise provided by Watson. So it s vital that you create a team of both ICT technicians and healthcare professionals to design that integration effectively. It s also very important to ensure that the right training in the use of Watson is carried out, so that everyone is up to speed with what it can do and how best to utilise its information tools.

 Due to its cloud-based nature, Watson isn t a simple  straight out of the box  tool; it does need some time and thought to go into its implementation. However, it is a fantastically user-friendly system and can be effectively integrated with any healthcare ICT systems. ","Pharmaceuticals"

The most popular professional social media networking website is LinkedIn which was acquired by Microsoft in June 2016 and has greater than 100 million registered users. With such a large outreach, these and other less well-known social media communication and networking websites are being utilised with increasing frequency by commercial organisations to communicate with existing customers as well as to lure new ones. In the case of the pharmaceutical industry, social media is now actively used to convey information relating to education, marketing, connecting with patients/physicians and receiving feedback. The major pharmaceutical companies have links on their websites to multiple social media websites and the potential of these is vast and thus far is largely untapped. However, statistics such as the number of visitors to these social media websites is comparable to those of other large industries such as finance and oil.

Benefits and risks of social media for the pharmaceutical industry

Safeguarding of information that the pharmaceutical industry disseminates via social media is essential. Although pharmaceutical industry websites contain a wealth of useful information, there appears to be a general apprehension in their use to disseminate medically relevant information [3]. The benefits of social media for the pharmaceutical industry are significant, such as its high outreach with messages being broadcast to other market segments [4]. A public hearing on the promotion of FDA regulated medical products using the internet and social media tools was held in 2009 with the presentations for all stakeholders that attended made available and this is a valuable resource [5]. Subsequently, a social media guidance webinar was held in July 2014 with all material also being publically available [6]. This is especially relevant, as the FDA have issued warnings in some cases where the existence of potentially objectionable information has been identified on social media websites [7]. The pharmaceutical industry should tread carefully in this territory, especially with third party data being a potential liability. This is because an imbalanced view of a product s risks and bene ts with erroneous claims being posted by such third parties (largely consumers) may capture the attention of regulators [8].

New trends and likely future directions

Despite the above caveats, social media offers significant benefits that should not be underestimated. Recent trends indicate encouraging signs of change as the latest raft of guidelines provides more clarity detailing new FDA guidelines [9, 10]. There are limitations of social media and the somewhat unclear regulations have impeded the pharmaceutical industry from utilising this channel whole-heartedly. However, the recent spate of laws governing social media use has brought more clarity to its use and may potentially embolden the pharmaceutical industry.

"Investigator networks cultivated through risk-factor trials, drives data diversity in dementia research.","Extensive investigator networks, cultivated over the course of some of the world s largest clinical trials into the risk factors for dementia, present an exciting opportunity for the future of dementia trials. Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity","http://www.pharma-iq.com/clinical/columns/investigator-networks-cultivated-through-risk","<span class=""date-display-single"">Tuesday, August 02, 2016</span>","NA","Investigator networks cultivated through risk-factor trials, drives data diversity in dementia research. | Pharmaceuticals & Biotechnology | Pharma & Biotech ResourcesExtensive investigator networks, cultivated over the course of some of the world s largest clinical trials into the risk factors for dementia, present an exciting opportunity for the future of dementia trials. Diabetes, hypertension, stroke, vascular disease, smoking, poor diet, physical inactivity and even depression have been linked to an increase in the likelihood of an individual presenting with dementia at some point in their lives. Indeed, the causes of dementia are as varied and as personalized as the disease s impact and symptoms. With dementia being one of the major causes of disability and dependency among older people worldwide the social, economic and psychological impact on the individual, their family, their carers and the broader community, remains of critical interest to research organisations, physicians and pharmaceutical companies alike. As such, access to large clinical populations that represent a diversity of backgrounds and risk factors, could provide a solid foundation for the next major development in large-scale dementia trials.

The ways in which dementia impacts on an individual can manifest in different ways, depending on a number of contributing factors, such as the person s personality and their lifestyle prior to becoming sick. It is widely accepted that the symptoms of dementia are broken into three stages. These stages include:

The early stage: where the symptoms are relatively nuanced. Due to the gradual decline that is experienced in this stage, there is rarely any clinical intervention, despite, perhaps, the recommended alleviation of risk factors.

The middle stage: the disease becomes more prominent and the symptoms begin to impact on the individual, their family and/or their carer.

The late stage: is characterised by the individual s total incapacitation and complete dependence on their carer.  The physical and mental symptoms are obvious and memory disturbance is serious.

The length of time that it takes a patient to move through the three stages, again, is individualized. It is difficult to speculate how any one individual will interact with their physician s intervention. Due to the inconsistent/diverse appearance of symptoms and the broad range of contributing risk factors that may influence how the disease presents, developing a broad clinical population from which to derive data is critical in determining the efficacy and safety of any compound thought to alleviate symptoms and prolong the patients decline.

The scientific leadership that George Clinical engage with have been responsible for some of the world s largest studies into the risk factors that impact dementia.

 What George Clinical and its parent company- The George Institute for Global Health have achieved through their multi-regional trials [has] already had a significant impact on dementia,  Associate Professor Maree Hackett, Director of The George Institute s Neurological and Mental Health Division said.  The George s formidable track record in conducting large-scale, multi-regional trials into salt reduction, blood pressure lowering and stroke management, for example, have no-doubt made a significant dent in the instances of dementia globally. 

Stroke and blood pressure are two major contributors to the development of dementia. The INTERACT trials, led by George Clinical scientific leader, Professor Craig Anderson, is the largest ever clinical trial into acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH) ever conducted with 2839 patients participating from 144 hospitals around the world. The study measured the impact blood pressure lowering has on patients after acute brain haemorrhage. The intervention appeared to reduce disability and improve quality of life at 3 months. Similarly, the ENCHANTED trial conducted with over 3000 patients globally, again led by Professor Craig Anderson, analysed the effect of two doses of a clot dissolving agent in acute stroke and showed that by giving a low dose, the risk of brain haemorrhage, a known side effect of this widely used drug, was reduced. These global trials, conducted across a diverse range of patients, countries, backgrounds and cultures provide a solid foundation for similar sized, similarly complex, trials into dementia.

Likewise, George Clinical scientific leader - Professor Bruce Neal leads the ongoing China Salt Substitute and Stroke Study (SSaSS), the largest study of its kind, conducted in 600 rural villages across five northern provinces in China and Tibet. The study recruited 35 high risk individuals from each village, making a total of 21,000 participants. The rationale being that lowering salt intake will lower blood pressure and the stroke risk in this population. This approach to salt reduction has been identified by the World Health Organization as amongst the most cost-effective strategies for vascular disease prevention. The size, scale and impact of the SSaSS trial is staggering. The wealth of clinical data on one of the major risk factors for dementia, across one of the most populous regions on earth, provides future researchers with unparalleled clinical access and data sources.

 When conducting a clinical trial on something as complex as dementia, access to a largely trial-naive population with diversity demographic characteristics is key,  Associate Professor Hackett said.  The best thing about conducting clinical trials in the Asia-Pacific is that a large and diverse population is available, whose participation can produce definitive trial results   it is inherent to the region! 

As the world s population ages, and more people succumb to the debilitating impact of dementia, the capacity for researchers to access a diversity of clinical populations will be vital to the integrity of clinical trial data and the long-term sustainability of any intervention. Access to clinical populations throughout the diverse Asia-Pacific region, particularly to populations who have been identified as at risk, would provide a more robust data set for addressing a disease such as dementia.","Pharmaceuticals"

While mapping out the areas of interest specifically which would gain investment from pharma firms over 2016, Tom Macfarlane, drug development professional  noted:

 Much growth in the sector is being driven by expansion into developing markets, thus increasing demand for people with international experience. Taking the supply chain as an example, although track-and-trace initiatives should simplify and facilitate logistics in the long-term, in the short term there may be increasing competition for those with specialist knowledge of developing markets.

 Additionally, changes in the broader business model are driving a need for non-traditional skillsets and backgrounds, especially technology and the healthcare-provider/payor side. Pharma companies are digitising their internal processes and data, taking an increasing interest in electronic marketing as a more cost-effective alternative to large teams of sales-reps, and needing to obtain and make use data from patients and heathcare providers. One can see the reflection of this in the healthcare workstreams being pioneered by the tech giants, such as Apple, Google and IBM. 

The Pharma IQ team has conducted some research and compiled this ultimate guide on the pharmaceutical industry's top 10 firms based on the Forbes Fortune 500 ranking. The majority of pharma firms managed to improve their Fortune 500 rankings, with Celgene rising by 65 places.

Please note that the order follows that of the Fortune 500 rank.

First once again emerging first in the pharma industry ranking, J&J saw many successes over the past year, including its award winning efforts with the supply of an Ebola vaccine through Sierra Leone and joining the combat against the Zika Virus. This year saw the opening of JLabs in Toronto, a new 40,000-square-foot life sciences incubator, providing entrepreneurs shared lab space and offices, modular lab suites and access to scientific, industry and capital funding experts as they work to build important and successful early-stage companies.

However, the pharma giant has encountered some complications, for example with a court case arising focusing on alleged side effects of Johnson s baby powder. Also, media reports have noted that there may be a major restructuring in the firm to obtain cost savings, with expected net positions being eliminated from their global medical devices segment standing at around 3000.

Climbing one place in its Fortune 500 rank, Pfizer is reported to be providing 130 new jobs to manufacturing sites in Dublin and Cork. In Q3 of 2015, Pfizer finalised its acquisition of Hospira, Inc - a provider of injectable drugs and biosimilars. Additionally, following the termination of the potential Allergan merger, Pfizer announced that it is considering conducing strategic split in some form.

3 Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada)

Earlier this year, Merck (MSD outside of US and Canada) was reported to have paid US$20 million for an oncology drug produced by a team of scientists at Harvard. This is said to have been the highest upfront cash payment Harvard has ever received from a pharma licensing deal. In regards to the firm s Ebola Zaire, V920 (rVSV G-ZEBOV-GP, live attenuated): the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the vaccine candidate Breakthrough Therapy Designation, and the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has granted PRIME (PRIority MEdicines) status.

Also,  Merck KGaA owned Sigma-Aldrich is reported to add 100 new jobs to its St.Louis base.

Making considerable progress on its ranking last year, Gilead Sciences has seen a number of wins recently, with the European Commission Grants Marketing Authorization for Gilead s Epclusa   also the firm has a a HIV-1 infection treatment in its pipeline. The firm saw year-on-year growth in total product sales in Q1 of 2016. Gilead s product Sovaldi ranked 3rd  in the world s top global pharmaceuticals in IMS  ranking.

Humira, labelled as the world s best selling drug for the past couple of years, has faced reports of potential competition this year as the US FDA accepted for review Amgen s Biologics License Applicaiont for ABP 501- labeled as a biosimilar candidate for Humira. Abbvie has achieved a number of drug approvals from regulators and have recently announced its oncology clinical collaboration with Bristol Myers Squibb to assess the combination of Abbvie s Rova-T and BMS  Opdivo as a treatment for  relapsed extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.

Amgen s Enbrel is estimated to come in 6th in the ranking of top global pharmaceutical products in 2020 by revenue, charted to have accumulated US$7 billion in revenue by 2020. A patent suit has been brought in regards to this product in Q1 of 2016.

In the final quarter of 2015,  Eli Lilly and Merck s extended their Immuno-oncology Collaboration  to evaluate the fusion of Lilly s ALIMTA and Merck s KEYTRUDA. The combination therapy is said to be in Phase III and is focused on first line nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer.

Earlier in 2016, Bristol Myers Squibb signed an agreement to acquire the outstanding stock of Padlock   biotechnology company focused on the treatment of destructive autoimmune diseases. The deal is set to further strengthen the firm s immunoscience pipeline. Also BMS completed acquisition of Cardioxyl Pharmaceuticals Inc.   The trade contains complete rights to Cardioxyl s leading asset   CXL- 1427   which is in phase 2 of clinical development positioned as treatment for acute decompensated heart failure.

Last year Biogen was reported to have reduced its global workforce by around 800 people, in line with its corporate restructuring to focus its R&D pipeline which features Alzheimer disease candidates. Last month, Biogen s investigational alzheimer s disease treatment Aducanumab was accepted into European Medicines Agency s PRIME Program.

Celgene saw the most dramatic rise in ratings out of the Pharma Top 10 companies for 2016 - rising by 65 places. This firm was charted as the second fastest growing pharma company within the fortune 500 in 2015. Its cancer treatment Revlimid is attributed to be the engine behind this surge.  Also, Celgene has made a range of partnerships with small biotech companies.

In providing insight for job seekers in the pharma industry looking for their next opportunity, Tom Macfarlane noted:  Many job-seekers are inclined to focus on the larger multinationals, which they percieve to offer greater security and a greater potential for advancement. However these multinationals are doing an increasing amount of their research by partnering or backing smaller companies, including start-ups, with a view to acquiring them and their assets in the fullness of time. It can therefore makes sense to evaluate a potential employer based on their pipeline, rather than just their size. ","Pharmaceuticals"

Taking the measure of protein populations is the essence of protein profiling, a venerable practice that is growing in sophistication as it becomes more proteomic in character. In fact, the phrase  protein profiling  is used synonymously with  proteome profiling.  Arguably, though, protein profiling is the more general term, since a protein profile that encompasses a subset of the proteome may suffice for a particular purpose.

Besides generality,  protein profiling  has the advantage of modesty. It may be taken as an admission that even the most extensive protein profiles are more sensitive to some proteins than others. In any case, some corners of the proteome remain dark.

While protein profiling may lack proteomic omniscience, it is demonstrating a proteomic outlook. It is part of a shift from protein identification to protein quantification, the measurement of protein expression levels. Moreover, protein profiling now encompasses protein structure-function relationships and protein-protein interactions. Protein profiles may reflect not only the fluctuations in protein levels, but also the shifts between active and inactive protein forms.

As always, protein profiles are about comparisons diseased vs. healthy, treated vs. untreated, experimental vs. control but now the comparisons have more depth. They are like census-based analyses that substantiate increasingly fine demographic distinctions. Protein profiling is becoming more refined through the use of advanced experimental and analytical approaches, several of which are summarized here.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Cancer and Unstable Genomes Linked to Junk DNA Changes","

Although variants are scattered throughout the genome, scientists have largely ignored the stretches of repetitive genetic code once dismissively known as  junk  DNA in their search for differences that influence human health and disease. Now, new research shows that variation in these overlooked repetitive regions may also affect human health. These regions can affect the stability of the genome and the proper function of the chromosomes that package genetic material, leading to an increased risk of cancer, birth defects, and infertility. The study (""Genomic variation within alpha satellite DNA influences centromere location on human chromosomes with metastable epialleles ) appears online in Genome Research.

 Variation is not only important for how genes and proteins function, but it can also occur in the noncoding, repetitive portions of the genome,  said Beth A. Sullivan, Ph.D., senior author of the study and associate professor of molecular biology and microbiology at Duke University School of Medicine.  What we found is probably the tip of the iceberg. There could be all sorts of functional consequences to having variation within the complex, repetitive portion of the genome that we don t know about yet. 

Even though the sequence of the human genome was declared complete more than a decade ago, it retains several glaring gaps, especially in the repetitive sequences around centromeres, the twisty ties that hold a pair of chromosomes together in a floppy X shape and coordinate their movement during cell division.

These centromere sequences (satellite DNA) are made up of blocks of exactly 171 As, Cs, Ts, and Gs, repeated over and over for millions of base-pairs. Researchers once believed that each chromosome contained a single stretch of this satellite DNA, which determined where its centromere would reside. But a few years ago, Dr. Sullivan s lab discovered that many human chromosomes possessed more than one of these regions, and depending on the individual, the centromere could form at either site.

In this study, Dr. Sullivan wanted to see how the chromosome decides where to put its centromere, and whether one site builds a  better  centromere than the other. Of the 23 pairs of human chromosomes, she focused on chromosome 17, which is structurally rearranged or mutated in many different cancers and birth defects.

First, Dr. Sullivan and her team combined molecular and visual assays, stretching the chromosome out into long chromatin fibers that were painted with fluorescent probes to map the variation in genomic sequence at the two different regions of satellite DNA. Then they looked at each satellite region for the presence of proteins necessary to construct a fully functioning centromere.

The researchers found that genomic variation at one of these satellite DNA regions, either in the size or sequence of its repeated 171 base pair units, ultimately determines whether the centromere is built at the primary site or the alternate site.

When they interrogated samples from a human DNA bank, they found that about 70% of humans have little genomic variation at the primary site, while 30% have differing degrees of variation. Most of the time, the centromeres aren t built at the primary site if it contains variation and instead are assembled at the  backup  site nearby. But when this happens, the result may be a dysfunctional centromere that is architecturally unsound and an unstable chromosome that may be present in too many or too few copies.

 It is immensely fascinating to think that there are so many people walking around who are essentially centromere mosaics,  said Dr. Sullivan.  One of their centromeres, on one of their chromosomes, has the potential to be dangerously unstable, and it could affect their ability to reproduce, or predispose them to cancer. 

In the future, Dr. Sullivan plans to investigate just how big of a risk the variant satellite regions pose for those who carry them, and possibly develop a way to use these sequences as biomarkers for the chromosomal defects that can lead to disease.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Vacation and Meditation Impact Stress Response- and Immune Function-Related Gene Activity"," 
	Researchers from the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, the University of California, San Francisco, and Harvard Medical School say they used a rigorous study design to assess the biological impact of meditation compared to vacation.

A meditation retreat, for those who already used meditation regularly, was associated with molecular networks characterized by antiviral activity. The molecular signature of long-term meditators was distinct from the nonmeditating vacationers. The study ( Meditation and Vacation Effects Impact Disease-Associated Molecular Phenotypes ) is published in Springer Nature's journal Translational Psychiatry.

The study involved 94 healthy women, aged 30 60. Sixty-four women were recruited who were not regular meditators. Participants stayed at the same resort in California for 6 days and randomized so that half were simply on vacation while the other half joined a meditation training program run by the Chopra Center for Well Being. The meditation program included training in mantra meditation, yoga, and self-reflection exercises. It was designed by Deepak Chopra, M.D., who did not participate in data collection or analysis.

For greater insight into the long-term effects of what scientists dubbed the ""meditation effect"" compared to the ""vacation effect,"" the team also studied a group of 30 experienced meditators who were already enrolled in the retreat that week. Researchers collected blood samples and surveys from all participants immediately before and after their stay, as well as surveys 1 month and 10 months later.

""In the spirit of other research efforts we have pioneered with other groups, this work underscores the importance of studies focused on healthy people,"" said Eric Schadt, Ph.D., senior author on the paper and the Jean C. and James W. Crystal Professor of Genomics at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, and Founding Director of the Icahn Institute for Genomics and Multiscale Biology. ""By combining an interrogation of gene networks with advanced data analysis and statistics, we have generated clinically meaningful information about stress and aging that is relevant to the broader population.""

The research team examined the changes in 20,000 genes to determine which types of genes were changing before and after the resort experience. Scientists performed an integrative transcriptomic analysis, comparing gene expression networks across all three groups of participants and finding unique molecular profiles and pathway enrichment patterns.

Study results show that all groups novice meditators, experienced meditators, and vacationers had significant changes in molecular network patterns after the week at the resort, with a clear signature distinguishing baseline from post-vacation biology. The most notable changes in gene activity were related to stress response and immune function.

Researchers assessed self-reported measures of well-being. While all groups showed improvements up to 1 month later, the novice meditators had fewer symptoms of depression and less stress much longer than the nonmeditating vacationers. The psychological effects appear to be enduring, and it is unknown how much of this longer-lasting benefit may be due to continued practice or lasting changes in how people view events in their lives.

""It's intuitive that taking a vacation reduces biological processes related to stress, but it was still impressive to see the large changes in gene expression from being away from the busy pace of life, in a relaxing environment, in such a short period of time. These findings will have to be replicated to see if the changes are reliably invoked under the same circumstances, in future studies, and compared to an at-home control group,"" noted Elissa S. Epel, Ph.D., Professor of Psychiatry at University of California, San Francisco and first author of the study.

""Based on our results, the benefit we experience from meditation isn't strictly psychological; there is a clear and quantifiable change in how our bodies function,"" added Rudolph Tanzi, Ph.D., the Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy Professor of Neurology at Harvard University, and Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital. ""Meditation is one of the ways to engage in restorative activities that may provide relief for our immune systems, easing the day-to-day stress of a body constantly trying to protect itself. The prediction is that this would then lead to healthier aging.""","Pharmaceuticals"

A research team led by scientists at the University of Basel and ETH Zurich created biot-Ru-SAV within Escherichia coli bacteria by using the biotin streptavidin technology. This method relies on the high affinity of the protein streptavidin for the vitamin biotin, where compounds bound to biotin can be introduced into the protein to generate artificial enzymes.

The scientists described their work in an article ( Directed Evolution of Artificial Metalloenzymes for In Vivo Metathesis ) that appeared August 29 in the journal Nature. The article describes how an abiotic co-factor that incorporated ruthenium was joined with a protein to create the artificial metalloenzyme.

 We report the compartmentalization and in vivo evolution of an artificial metalloenzyme for olefin metathesis, which represents an archetypal organometallic reaction without equivalent in nature,  wrote the article s authors.  Building on previous work on an artificial metallohydrolase, we exploit the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction compartment for the  metathase  because it offers an auspicious environment for artificial metalloenzymes, mainly owing to low concentrations of inhibitors such as glutathione, which has recently been identified as a major inhibitor. 

This approach allowed the scientists to overcome a difficulty often encountered with metal co-factors. Such co-factors are inhibited by cellular components and require purification of the scaffold protein. Unfortunately, the need for purification limits the throughput of genetic optimization schemes applied to artificial metalloenzymes and their applicability in vivo to expand natural metabolism.

""The main breakthrough was the idea to use the periplasm of Escherichia coli as a reaction compartment, whose environment is much better suited for an olefin metathesis catalyst,"" said Markus Jeschek, M.Sc., the Nature article s first author and a researcher at ETH Zurich. The periplasm, the space between the inner cytoplasmic membrane and the bacterial outer membrane in Gram-negative bacteria, contains low concentrations of metalloenzymes inhibitors, such as glutathione.

Having found ideal in vivo conditions, the authors went a step forward and decided to optimize biot-Ru-SAV by applying principles of directed evolution, a method that mimics the process of natural selection to evolve proteins with enhanced properties or activities. ""We could then develop a simple and robust screening method that allowed us to test thousands of biot-Ru-SAV mutants and identify the most active variant,"" explained Thomas R. Ward, Ph.D., the article s senior author and a professor of chemistry at the University of Basel.

 This strategy facilitated the assembly of a functional metathase in vivo and its directed evolution with substantially increased throughput compared to conventional approaches that rely on purified protein variants,  asserted the authors of the Nature article.  The evolved metathase compares favorably with commercial catalysts, shows activity for different metathesis substrates and can be further evolved in different directions by adjusting the workflow. 

Not only could the authors markedly improve the catalytic properties of biot-Ru-SAV, but they could also show that organometallic-based enzymes can be engineered and optimized for different substrates, thus producing a variety of different chemical products. ""The exciting thing about this is that artificial metalloenzymes like biot-Ru-SAV can be used to produce novel high-added-value chemicals,"" concluded Dr. Ward. ""It has a lot of potential to combine both chemical and biological tools to ultimately utilize cells as molecular factories.""","Pharmaceuticals"
"Vitamin C As an Aid to Help Treat Leukemia"," 
	Over the years vitamin C supplementation has had a tumultuous relationship with empirical science.

The scientific community had later discovered that Pauling s data was weak, to say the least, as he had only one test subject his wife. Unfortunately, the damage had been done, and many vitamin C myths persist today, complicating potentially beneficial roles.

Yet now, a team of researchers has published new data showing that supplementations of the epigenetic cancer drug called decitabine (5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine) with vitamin C enhanced the drug's ability to impede cancer cell growth and trigger cellular self-destruction in cancer cell lines. Previous research has found that many cancer patients are deficient in vitamin C, and the researchers were interested testing chemotherapeutic agents with levels of vitamin C that would correct the deficiency and not overload the patients.

Interestingly, a pilot clinical trial based on this work is currently ongoing in adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) at Rigshospitalet in Copenhagen, Denmark. This trial combines a similar drug called azacitidine the standard of care therapy with vitamin C.

""If the pilot trial is successful, we plan to pursue a larger trial to explore this strategy's potential as a straightforward and cost-effective way to improve the existing therapy for AML and MDS,"" explained co-senior study author Peter Jones, Ph.D., D.Sc., chief scientific officer at the Van Andel Research Institute (VARI) and co-leader of the Van Andel Research Institute-Stand Up To Cancer (VARI-SU2C) Epigenetics Dream Team. ""At the same time, we must urge patience and caution. Only a clinical trial that combines azacitidine with the blinded addition of either vitamin C or a placebo will give the true answer as to whether or not vitamin C increases the efficacy of azacitidine in patients. We must emphasize that our trial is limited to a certain subset of patients with MDS or AML on a specific therapeutic regimen. We do not have evidence that this approach is appropriate for other cancers or chemotherapies.""

For the recently published article, the investigators looked at the effect of vitamin C addition could have on cancer cell lines when combined with methyltransferase inhibitor drugs.

 Here we show how this [vitamin C] deficiency may influence the use of DNA methyltransferase inhibitors (DNMTis) for the treatment of hematological neoplasias,  the authors wrote.  In vitro, when vitamin C is added at physiological levels too low doses of the DNMTi 5-aza-2 -deoxycytidine (5-aza-CdR), there is a synergistic inhibition of cancer-cell proliferation and increased apoptosis. These effects are associated with enhanced immune signals including increased expression of bidirectionally transcribed endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts, increased cytosolic dsRNA, and activation of an IFN [interferon]-inducing cellular response. 

The findings from this study were published recently in Proceedings of the National Academy of Science (PNAS) in an article entitled  Vitamin C Increases Viral Mimicry Induced by 5-Aza-2 -deoxycytidine. 

In the pilot clinical study, the scientists proposed a strategy that reflects a continuing move toward combination therapies, particularly when it comes to epigenetic approaches, which target the mechanisms that control whether genes are switched ""on"" or ""off."" In many cancers, these switches improperly activate or silence essential genes, such as those that regulate cell growth and life cycle, ultimately leading to tumors. Epigenetic therapies are thought to work in two ways to fix these errors in cancer cells by correcting the ""position"" of the gene switches and by making the cell appear as though it's infected by a virus, triggering the immune system.

""This type of combination therapy is promising, but more work is needed to determine its safety and efficacy,"" noted co-senior author Kirsten Gr nb k, M.D., D. Sc., chief hematologist and professor at University of Copenhagen's Rigshospitalet and a member of the VARI-SU2C Epigenetics Dream Team. ""It is truly exciting to consider that there could be a simple and elegant approach to help patients fight MDS and AML. However, as a physician, I strongly urge patients to wait for the results of the clinical trial and to discuss all dietary and supplemental changes with their doctors.""

While the authors are optimistic about their findings and future results, they stressed the need for patience to wait for the results of the clinical trial. Maintaining proper nutrition is an important part of cancer therapy. Patients are strongly urged to consult their doctors before making any change to their nutrition or vitamin regimen. Use of vitamin C may preclude patients from participating in a clinical trial.","Pharmaceuticals"

Mundipharma has marketing rights to flutiform for most of the world outside North America and Japan and Kyorin has marketing rights in Japan.

flutiform combines fluticasone propionate (fluticasone), an inhaled corticosteroid (ICS), and the LABA formoterol fumarate in an aerosol inhaler incorporating Vectura's proprietary SkyeDry  technology.

 COPD is a complex and highly variable disease and these trial results highlight the challenge in demonstrating reductions of exacerbations with ICS/LABA combinations in today's treatment environment,  Vectura CEO James Ward-Lilley said in a statement.  Whilst this result is disappointing, flutiform continues to grow strongly based on the approved asthma indication, which continues to underpin our expectations for future growth of the product.

The study (""Mapping the Cell-Surface N-Glycoproteome of Human Hepatocytes Reveals Markers for Selecting a Homogeneous Population of iPSC-Derived Hepatocytes""), published in Stem Cell Reports, is expected to aid work on liver disease for the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)'s $80 million Next Generation Genetic Association Studies (Next Gen) Program.

The University of Minnesota, the Medical College of Wisconsin, and  Medical University of South Carolina (MUSC) were involved in the the study.

This new methodology could facilitate progress toward an important clinical goal the treatment of patients with disease-causing mutations in their livers by transplantation of unmutated liver cells derived from their own stem cells. Previous attempts to generate liver-like cells from stem cells have yielded heterogeneous cell populations that bear little resemblance to diseased livers in patients.

NHLBI's Next Gen was created to bank stem cell lines sourced from patients in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). The goal of the NHLBI Next Gen Lipid Conditions subsection is to help determine the genetic sources of heart, lung, or blood conditions that also encompass the liver. These GWAS studies map the genomes in hundreds of people as a way to look for genetic mutation patterns that differ from the genomes of healthy individuals.

A GWAS study becomes more powerful as more genomes are mapped. Once a panel of suspected mutations is built, stem cells from these individuals can be ""pushed"" in culture dishes to differentiate into any of the body's cells, as, for example, liver-, heart-, or vascular-like cells. The cells can be screened in high-throughput formats (i.e., cells are expanded and cultured in many dishes) to learn more about the mutations and to test panels of drugs that might ultimately help treat patients harboring a disease.

The problem arises during the ""pushing."" For example, iPSCs stubbornly refuse to mature uniformly into liver-like cells when fed growth factors. Traditionally, antibodies have been used to recognize features of maturity on the surfaces of cells and purify cells that are alike. This approach has been crucial to stem cell research, but available antibodies that recognize mature liver cells are few and tend to recognize many different kinds of cells. The many types of cells in mixed populations have diverse characteristics that can obscure underlying disease-causing genetic variations, which tend to be subtle.

""Without having a pure population of liver cells, it was incredibly difficult to pick up these relatively subtle differences caused by the mutations, but differences that are important in the life of an individual,"" said Stephan  A. Duncan, D. Phil., SmartState Chair of Regenerative Medicine at MUSC.

Instead of relying on antibodies, Dr. Duncan and his crew embraced a new technology called chemoproteomic cell-surface capture (CSC) technology, which allowed the group to map the proteins on the surface of liver cells that were most highly produced during the final stages of differentiation of stem cells into liver cells. The most abundant protein was targeted with an antibody labeled with a fluorescent marker and used to sort the mature liver cells from the rest.

The procedure was successful. The team had a population of highly pure, homogeneous, and mature liver-like cells. Labeled cells had far more similar traits of mature hepatocytes than unlabeled cells. Pluripotent stem cells that had not differentiated were excluded from the group of labeled cells.

""That's important,"" said Dr. Duncan. ""If you're wanting to transplant cells into somebody that has liver disease, you really don't want to be transplanting pluripotent cells because pluripotent cells form tumors called teratocarcinomas.""

He cautions that transplantation of iPSC-derived liver cells is not yet ready for translation to the clinic. But the technology for sorting homogeneous liver cells can be used now to  model and study disease successfully and accurately in the cell culture dish.

""We think that by being able to generate pure populations, it will get rid of the variability, and therefore really help us combine with GWAS studies to identify allelic variations that are causative of a disease, at least in the liver,"" added Dr. Duncan.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Deriving New Drugs from the Natural World"," 
	Nature has been providing medicines to treat our diseases and relieve our suffering for many thousands of years. As noted by Harvard University&rsquo;s Center for Health and the Global Environment, despite great advances in rational drug design, most prescribed medicines used in industrialized countries today are still derived from&mdash;or patterned after&mdash;natural compounds from plants and animals. And this is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. ","http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligenceand153/deriving-new-drugs-from-the-natural-world/77900732/","NA","NA","Deriving New Drugs from the Natural World | Insight & Intelligence&#153;In one of the odd twists of fate that make the topic of medicines derived from animals so fascinating, one of the most fruitful places to look within the animal kingdom is the vast array of poisons and venoms that organisms have evolved to ward off predators or to attack prey. More than 30 years ago, Capoten (captopril) copied from a pit viper venom peptide became the first approved venom-derived drug (in this case for hypertension). Several venom-derived drugs have since been approved for cardiovascular disease, as has a venom-derived painkiller. Today, thanks to increasing knowledge of the human nervous and immune systems, the pipeline  from fang to pharmacy  (as The Scientist memorably described it in 2013) is growing ever bigger.

Scorpions are proving useful in medicine as well. As reported recently by Christie Wilcox in her book Venomous: How Earth s Deadliest Creatures Mastered Biochemistry, researchers are at work on a  tumor paint  known as BLZ-100, derived from scorpion venom, which causes rapid paralysis in insects. This targeted contrast agent, which is being used in clinical studies for children s brain tumors, binds to chloride channels found in tumor cells; thus, by linking this toxin to a fluorescent dye, doctors can see and remove an entire cancerous mass.

Another venom-derived drug comes from the sun anemone Stichodactyla helianthus, which lives on reefs in the Caribbean and uses its soft green tentacles to stun shrimp with a cocktail of toxins. Physiologists have shown that one of these toxins, a peptide called ShK, is a potent inhibitor of a T-lymphocyte potassium channel called Kv1.3, the upregulation of which is implicated in autoimmune diseases. And a poison produced by the cone snail Conus geographus has been shown to be 1,000 times more powerful than morphine in treating certain kinds of chronic pain. For example, the snail-derived drug Prialt  (ziconotide) jams up nerve transmission in the spinal cord and blocks certain pain signals from reaching the brain.

The tropical forests and savannahs of Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay are the habitats of the feared pit viper Bothrops jararaca (also known as the fer-de-lance). Snakebites from this species often result in the victim s collapse due to a massive drop in blood pressure. A research effort has worked out how the viper venom causes that blood pressure decrease and exactly what chemical in the venom is responsible. That knowledge led to abatement of morbidity and mortality from the pathological effects of chronic high blood pressure, via the creation of so-called angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. As another example, the diabetes drug exenatide, which lowers blood sugar and increases the body s production of insulin, is a synthetic version of a component exendin-4 in the saliva of Gila monsters, large venomous lizards found in the southwestern U.S. and northwestern Mexico.

Finally, one of the more unlikely inspirations in recent years involves one of the natural world s least-celebrated liquids: the saliva of the tick Ornithodoros moubata. A new inhibitor of the complement protein C5, a small recombinant compact protein named Coversin, has been derived from a protein in the tick s saliva. The natural Coversin molecule works by damping down the immune response of the host animal that the tick feeds off of, enabling it to feed repeatedly without damage from host inflammatory substances. Coversin is currently being studied as a potential treatment for rare autoimmune diseases, including paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria, atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome, and Guillain-Barre  syndrome.

Despite the challenges involved on average, only one in thousands of natural compounds tested shows pharmaceutical promise and only a handful of those ever make it to market, according to Scientific American researchers press on. Mother Nature, with millions of years of experience under her belt, continues to be the ultimate drug developer.","Pharmaceuticals"

Additional data on DKN-01 plus the combination of gemcitabine and cisplatin in patients with cholangiocarcinoma will be presented at ESMO s Annual Meeting in October.

Two years ago at the American Society for Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2014 Annual Meeting, Leap presented data from a Phase I dose-escalation study showing that DKN-01 demonstrated clinical activity as a single agent in patients with non-small-cell lung cancer.

At ASCO s annual meeting this year, Leap presented Phase I data on its other immune-oncology candidate, TRX518, an aglycosylated monoclonal agonist antibody targeting the glucocorticoid-induced TNFR-related (GITR) protein. The trial showed that a single dose of TRX518 in patients with advanced solid tumors was safe and well-tolerated, with no autoimmune treatment-related adverse events, Leap said on June 5.

 We anticipate achieving substantial clinical milestones over the course of 2016 and 2017,  Leap CEO Christopher K. Mirabelli, Ph.D., said in a statement, including presenting data and initiating randomized studies for DKN-01 and reporting data from a repeat-dose study of TRX518.

Added Nissim Mashiach, Macrocure s president and CEO:  After careful review of many alternatives, the executive team and Board of Directors of Macrocure believe this transaction provides great potential for our shareholders. 

Massiach and another Macrocure-designated person will join Leap's Board of Directors upon closing of the transaction. The combined company will be based at Leap s corporate offices in Cambridge, MA, and be led by Leap s executive team, which will remain in place. Christopher K. Mirabelli, Ph.D., will serve as CEO and chairman, Augustine Lawlor as COO, and Douglas E. Onsi as CFO.

Macrocure shareholders will exchange their shares for new shares of Leap common stock. On a pro forma basis, Macrocure equity holders are expected collectively to own approximately 31.8% of the combined company, with the remaining 68.2% to be owned by Leap equity holders, subject to adjustments based on Macrocure's net cash level at closing.

Existing Leap shareholders will receive the right to a royalty based on future net sales. The combined company is expected to have a minimum of $30 million cash at closing to finance future operations, Leap and Macrocure said.

Macrocure will become a wholly owned subsidiary of Leap, while Leap will become a public company, applying to list shares of the combined entity for trading on NASDAQ upon completion of the merger.

The transaction is expected to close near year end, subject to shareholder approval and other customary closing conditions. The boards of Leap and Macrocure have unanimously approved the proposed merger, while holders of approximately 51% of Macrocure voting shares have entered into agreements supporting the deal, assuring approval of the merger, according to both companies. All Macrocure shareholders will be asked to vote on the merger at a shareholders meeting.

Additionally, entities affiliated with HealthCare Ventures and Eli Lilly, which own all of Leap's outstanding voting shares, have entered into agreements supporting the proposed transaction, Leap and Macrocure added.

Existing Leap investors, including entities affiliated with HealthCare Ventures, have committed to invest an additional $10 million at the closing of the transaction.","Pharmaceuticals"
"DNA Can Be Edited Without Being Cut","

According to the Kobe University scientists, Target-AID may be free of one of the complications associated with the CRISPR/Cas9, namely, the risk of cytotoxicity. Cytotoxicity may occur if the CRISPR/Cas9 system s nuclease activity results in chromosome splitting.

The Kobe University team anticipates that Target-AID will be applied to gene therapy in the future. More immediate applications include the breeding of organisms that will be useful in disease and drug-discovery research.

In bacteria, CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats)/Cas (CRISPR-associated) records and cleaves invasive foreign DNA. A ribonucleoprotein complex of Cas nuclease and guide-RNA (gRNA) binds to complementary target DNA sequences, forms an R-loop, and then cleaves the DNA. In vertebrates, AID is responsible for targeted hypermutation by modifying the deoxycytidine of the variable region of the immunoglobulin locus.

AID creates mutations in DNA by deaminating cytosine, thereby turning it into uracil. Essentially, AID changes a C:G base pair into a U:G mismatch. Afterward, when the cell's DNA replication machinery recognizes the U as a T, the C:G is converted to a T:A base pair. Such base-pair changes ensure the production of diverse secondary antibodies through a process known as somatic hypermutation.

Target-AID, the Kobe University scientists found, succeeded in modifying genetic function by inducing target point mutations at a highly efficient rate. The scientists also observed that the toxicity associated with the CRISPR/Cas9 system was greatly reduced.

These findings appeared August 4 in the journal Science, in an article entitled,  Targeted Nucleotide Editing Using Hybrid Prokaryotic and Vertebrate Adaptive Immune Systems.  The article s authors included senior author Akihiko Kondo, Ph.D., and first author Keiji Nishida, Ph.D., both of Kobe s Graduate School of Science, Technology, and Innovation.

 Nuclease-deficient type II CRISPR/Cas9 and the activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID) ortholog PmCDA1 were engineered to form a synthetic complex (Target-AID) that performs highly efficient target-specific mutagenesis,  wrote the article s authors.  Specific point mutation was induced majorly at cytidines within the target range of five bases.

The Kobe scientists noted that their hybrid approach could be extended by incorporating different cytidine deaminases. For example, the cytidine deaminase used in the current study, PmCDA1, is derived from the sea lamprey. It could be replaced by another cytidine deaminase, rAPOBEC1, which is a rat apolipoprotein B mRNA editing enzyme catalytic polypeptide.

 Although direct comparison will be needed, these two systems may complement each other to extend the repertoire of possible editing sites,  explained the authors of the Science article.  Using other CRISPR-related systems or other modifier enzymes such as adenosine deaminase also will broaden the editing capacity and further enrich the genome editing toolbox. 

The authors indicated that the combination of nickase Cas9(D10A) and the deaminase induced insertion and deletion (indel) in mammalian cells. However, use of uracil DNA glycosylase inhibitor suppressed the indel formation and improved the system s efficiency.","Pharmaceuticals"

Now, a new study led by investigators at the University of Edinburgh has allowed scientists to move a step closer toward a test that can detect Parkinson s disease (PD) in the early stages of illness.

Utilizing spinal fluid from afflicted patients, researchers have developed a methodology for detecting the critical protein in PD pathology, alpha-synuclein, which forms sticky clumps called Lewy bodies inside the brain cells of people with PD and some types of dementia. The investigators agree that that the test needs to be validated with a larger sample group to verify their initial findings, but they are extremely optimistic that the new assay could one day help to improve diagnosis of the disease.

Previous efforts to develop a test for alpha-synuclein have produced inconsistent results because the protein is also found in healthy brains. It is only when the protein clumps together that it causes problems. In the new study, the University of Edinburgh researchers made use of an extremely sensitive technology that measures the stickiness of proteins. The approach called real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) can detect tiny differences in the properties of proteins in the brain that can mean the difference between disease or not.

""We have already used this technique to develop an accurate test for Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease (CJD), another neurodegenerative condition,  explained senior study author Alison Green, Ph.D., Reader at the National CJD Research & Surveillance Unit, a part of the University of Edinburgh.  We hope that with further refinement, our approach will help to improve diagnosis for Parkinson's patients. 

In initial tests, the technique was able to identify 19 out of 20 samples accurately from patients with PD, as well as three samples from people considered to be at risk of the condition. There were no false positives among any of the 15 control samples from healthy people. Moreover, the technique was also able to identify patients with a type of dementia caused by Lewy bodies, but not other kinds of dementia such as Alzheimer's disease.

 We have developed a novel real-time quaking-induced conversion RT-QuIC-based assay to detect alpha-synuclein aggregation in the brain and cerebrospinal fluid from dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease patients,  the authors wrote.  This assay can detect alpha-synuclein aggregation in Dementia with Lewy bodies and Parkinson's disease cerebrospinal fluid with sensitivities of 92% and 95%, respectively, and with an overall specificity of 100% when compared to Alzheimer and control cerebrospinal fluid. 

The findings from this study were published recently in the Annals of Clinical and Translational Neurology in an article entitled  Alpha-synuclein RT-QuIC in the CSF of Patients with Alpha-synucleinopathies. 

""We are also interested in whether [the test] could be used to identify people with Parkinson's and Lewy body dementia in the early stages of their illness,  Dr. Green noted.  These people could then be given the opportunity to take part in trials of new medicines that may slow, or stop, the progression of disease.""

PD is a progressive brain condition caused by the loss of nerve cells. It is not known what causes the condition and there is currently no accurate test for it. Patients often have to wait years for a diagnosis, which is based on physical symptoms, their medical history, and the results of simple mental and physical exercises.","Pharmaceuticals"

The generation of vectors is performed in cell lines such as HEK293T, and it is feasible to optimize the cell culture conditions to maximize the process of vector generation. The step of gene transduction into HSPCs may also have room for improvement, considering that two rounds of transduction by vectors at multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 100 are required in the protocol for leading clinical-stage HSPC-GT assets.

Aside from the therapeutic gene, the quantitative aspect of HSPC engraftment in the patient is another critical factor for HSPC-GT and HSCT to be successful. It is well established from clinical studies that the effective cell dose is directly correlated with speed of hematopoietic recovery, immune reconstitution, long-term persistence of transplanted cells, and survival of recipients. Different methods for augmenting the effective HSPC cell dose are being attempted, including the enhancement of engraftment and the ex vivo expansion of HSPCs prior to transplantation. The ability of HSPCs to engraft could be enhanced, for example, by pretreatment with 16,16-dimethyl prostaglandin E2. Concomitantly, there has been intense research into the ex vivo expansion of HSPCs by companies that include Gamida Cell and Novartis, giving rise to reagents that induce varying multiples of HSC expansion.

These examples illustrate the opportunities and activities underway that are specifically aimed at improving HSPC-GT and HSCT. To help achieve these goals, suitable technologies are needed to identify best-in-class protocols for a variety of cell-based processes. Considering that the best protocols may be composed of multiple steps, flexible screening technologies with a dynamic range of capacity would be most suited to such a task. Potential platform technologies to meet such a need for high-throughput screening are beginning to emerge, including microfluidics, which provides computerized nanoscale culture systems, and combinatorial cell culture, which provides three-dimensional, bead-based cell cultures for screening thousands of protocols in a single experiment, with proven ability to identify improved cell manipulation protocols.

Such cell culture technologies bring new hope that improved cell culture protocols will be identified to streamline the complex process of HSPC-GT and so lower the cost, while also improving the safety and efficacy of the therapy, thus rendering this life-saving therapy a reality for all who can benefit from it.","Pharmaceuticals"

Multipartite-style infections even afflict computer systems. And now, for the first time, the multipartite approach to infection has been found to affect animals. Specifically, a multipartite virus has been found in mosquitoes.

The revelation comes from a scientific team led by researchers at U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID). The team is participating in a global effort to monitor and prepare for outbreaks of unknown viral diseases.

""One area we are focused on is the identification and characterization of novel viruses,"" said Gustavo Palacios, Ph.D., who directs USAMRIID's Center for Genome Sciences. ""This study allowed us to utilize all our tools and even though this virus does not appear to affect mammals, we are continuing to refine those tools so we can be better prepared for the next outbreak of disease that could have an impact on human health.""

Dr. Palacios is the senior author of a study that appeared August 25 in the journal Cell Host & Microbe, in an article entitled,  A Multicomponent Animal Virus Isolated from Mosquitoes.  The article reports that a newly discovered multipartite virus, called Guaico Culex virus (GCXV), was isolated from several species of mosquitoes in Central and South America.

The virus does not appear to be a human pathogen, or even a mammalian one. However, deep sequencing indicated that GCXV belongs to a group of segmented viruses called Jingmenviruses, which were first discovered in 2014. In the current study, a Jingmenvirus was found in the blood of a nonhuman primate, in this case a Ugandan red colobus monkey.

 GCXV belongs to a diverse clade of segmented viruses (Jingmenvirus) related to the prototypically unsegmented Flaviviridae,  wrote the authors of the Cell Host & Microbe article.  The GCXV genome comprises five segments, each of which appears to be separately packaged. The smallest segment is not required for replication, and its presence is variable in natural infections. 

Experts believe that the most likely infectious viruses to make the jump to humans are those that are already circulating in other mammals, especially nonhuman primates. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the monkey virus evaluated in the current study shared a segmented common ancestor with GCXV. However, researchers don't yet know if all Jingmenviruses are multicomponent like the Guaico Culex virus. It is also not known whether the Jingmenvirus isolated from the monkey has a pathogenic effect.

Taken together, the research suggests that the host range of the GCXV virus is quite diverse. Also, it provides evidence for the existence of multicomponent animal viruses and their potential relevance for animal and human health.","Pharmaceuticals"

In recent years, opinions on the drug have begun to soften, and hypothesis-driven research continues to increase, with the intent of separating factual data from anecdotes. Now, a collection of investigators led by scientists at the Montreal Neurological Institute and Hospital part of McGill University have provided new information that seeks to improve our understanding of how cannabinoids, the active agent in marijuana, affect vision in vertebrates.

Using tadpoles as a model system for vision and visual development, the researchers employed a variety of techniques to test how the tiny amphibians reacted to visual stimuli after they had been exposed to increased levels of exogenous or endogenous cannabinoids. Exogenous cannabinoids are artificially introduced drugs, whereas endogenous cannabinoids occur naturally in the body.

Contrary to what they expected, the investigators found that activating cannabinoid signaling in tadpoles actually increased the activity in their retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), which are responsible for transmitting information about light detection from the eye to the brain. This was divergent from previous study results which found that cannabinoids typically work to reduce neurotransmission, not increase it.

""Initially you distrust yourself when you see something that goes against widely held ideas, but we tried the experiment so many times, using diverse techniques, and it was a consistent result,"" explained senior study author Edward Ruthazer, Ph.D., professor of neurology and neurosurgery at the Montreal Neurological Institute of McGill University. ""So then we knew we had to figure out what was going on. The first tendency is to want to ignore it. But it was such a strong effect we knew there was something important here.""

Interestingly, the researchers found that one class of cannabinoid receptor, known as CB1R, plays a role in the suppression of chloride transport into the RGCs. When the receptor was activated, chloride levels were reduced, which hyperpolarizes the cell, making it able to fire at higher frequencies when stimulated. For the tadpoles, this meant they were able to detect dimmer objects in low light than when they had not been exposed to increased levels of cannabinoids.

 We identified a novel mechanism underlying a CB1R-mediated increase in retinal ganglion cell (RGC) intrinsic excitability acting through AMPK-dependent inhibition of NKCC1 [Na+-K+-2Cl  cotransporter 1] activity,  the authors wrote.  Clomeleon imaging and patch clamp recordings revealed that inhibition of NKCC1 downstream of CB1R activation reduces intracellular Cl  levels in RGCs, hyperpolarizing the resting membrane potential.""

The findings from this study were published recently in eLife in an article entitled  Endocannabinoid Signaling Enhances Visual Responses through Modulation of Intracellular Chloride Levels in Retinal Ganglion Cells. 

While it s too early to tell if cannabinoids have the same effect on human vision, there is anecdotal evidence in the scientific literature of cannabis ingestion improving night vision of Jamaican and Moroccan fishermen.

Yet, what is ultimately more interesting is that the researchers have stumbled upon a previously unknown role for cannabinoids in brain signaling. Now that therapeutic use of cannabinoids is becoming increasingly accepted by the medical community, the need for an accurate and thorough understanding of these chemicals' role in the brain is greater than ever.

""Our work provides an exciting potential mechanism for cannabinoid regulation of neuronal firing, but it will obviously be important to confirm that similar mechanisms are also at play in the eyes of mammals,"" noted Dr. Ruthazer. ""Though technically more challenging, a similar study should now be performed in the mouse retina or even in cultures of human retinal cells.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The company filed a notice of intent to appeal the sanctions, which were imposed by CMS last month. CMS  sanctions included revoking the lab s Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) certificate, and banning the company s CEO Elizabeth Holmes from owning, operating, or directing a lab for at least 2 years.

 Theranos is not conducting patient testing at its Newark facility,  the company said in a statement.  In addition, since CMS originally announced the imposition of sanctions, Theranos has made substantial progress toward correcting the deficiencies CMS identified,  Theranos said.

Theranos summarized its progress as appointing new laboratory leadership, strengthening its clinical policies and procedures, and revamping training programs.

 While the appeal is pending, Theranos intends to continue communicating with CMS regarding the possibility of reaching a mutually agreeable resolution to this matter,  Theranos added.

CMS is one of numerous federal and state agencies that have investigated the business model and diagnostic tests of Theranos, which once claimed that its diagnostic technology could run scores of tests using drops of blood.

On January 25, Karen Fuller, manager of CMS  State Oversight and CLIA Branch, sent Theranos Director Sunil Dhawan, M.D., a letter declaring:  The deficient practices of the laboratory pose immediate jeopardy to patient health and safety. 

Holmes, who founded the company in 2003, is among  owners and operators  of the lab who are banned from owning, operating, or directing a lab for at least 2 years.

In addition to the bans and revocation of CLIA certification, CMS also imposed sanctions that included:

CMS  sanctions came a month after Walgreens ended its relationship with Theranos, shutting down all 40 Theranos Wellness Centers in its Arizona stores and saying it will no longer offer the company s services.

Walgreens at the time cited the voiding of test results and CMS  earlier rejection of a correction plan for the lab submitted by Theranos. In May, The Wall Street Journal reported that Theranos had voided all results for tests run on its Edison device in 2014 and 2015, while correcting some blood coagulation tests performed at the Scottsdale lab.","Pharmaceuticals"

In addition to standard of care, each group of patients was treated every 2 days for a maximum of 20 weeks with either a placebo spray (saline solution) or a spray containing BC PDGF.

Data from the trial was supposed to support later Phase III trial planned for the U.S. and Europe.

 We are surprised and disappointed by these topline results, which are inconsistent with previously reported positive Phase I/II clinical results. Therefore, we have initiated a thorough review of the study to analyze the discrepancy in the data  Adocia CEO G rard Soula said in a statement.

In 2012, Adocvia trumpeted Phase I/II results showing that BioChaperone PDGF spray formulation showed a wound closure efficacy at least equivalent to that of Smith & Nephew s marketed gel Regranex (becaplermin), at one-third the weekly dosage and when applied half as often.

Since Adocia is among several drug developers to have reported Phase III clinical trial failures for a diabetic foot ulcer product, Soula added:  We have decided to halt all development work in this indication. 

Last October, for example, Macrocure acknowledged that its lead product candidate CureXcell missed its primary endpoint of a statistically significant proportion of subjects with complete wound closure at 16 weeks and sustained complete closure for four additional weeks. The failure helped sink Macrocure shares far enough to end up on GEN s list of Top 10 Wall Street Losers of 2015.

A month later, Derma Sciences terminated its Phase III trials for aclerastide (DSC127) after the Data Monitoring Committee for planned interim analyses concluded that the candidate was unlikely to meet its primary endpoint of closure of the target ulcer within 12 weeks of the start of treatment.

 Diabetic foot ulcer has proved an extremely difficult condition to address, as seen in multiple recent late-stage clinical trial failures. The main reason is the lack of uniformity in the standard of care of these types of wounds,  Soula added.","Pharmaceuticals"

The results of the study (""Genomewide Association Study of African Children Identifies Association of SCHIP1 and PDE8A with Facial Size and Shape""), published in PLoS Genetics, are the first genome-wide association study of face shape and size for an African population, and the results differ from those reported from similar studies in European-derived white adolescents and adults.

The team of scientists studied 3505 normal African Bantu children and adolescents ages 3 to 21 from the Mwanza region of Tanzania. An important aspect of this study was that this population is very lean, minimizing nongenetic influences on face shape and size, particularly age and excess body fat.

The study found that two genes, SCHIP1 and PDE8A, are associated with measures of human facial size. The researchers tested the finding in the lab on mice and found the genes were indeed involved in the developing face.

""Our findings provide a basis for detailed analyses of the functions of these genes in the developing face, and their roles in determining the normal facial variation that make us both individual different and individually recognizable,"" Dr. Spritz and his colleagues write.

The report is paired with another study (""Genomewide Association Study Reveals Multiple Loci Influencing Normal Human Facial Morphology"") simultaneously published in PLoS Genetics that looks at genome-wide association of 20 quantitative facial measurements in 3118 health individuals of European ancestry. In that study, researchers found evidence of genetic associations involving measures of eye, nose, and facial breadth.","Pharmaceuticals"
"Pursuing CRISPR Vision on Germline Editing"," 
	In their seminal 2012 paper describing CRISPR, Jennifer A. Doudna, Ph.D., of University of California, Berkeley, Emmanuelle Charpentier, Ph.D., now of the Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, and colleagues, more than understated the transformative impact of the technology whose role in genome editing they co-discovered. 
 
	Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) based on RNA-programmed Cas9, they wrote, offered &ldquo;considerable potential for gene-targeting and genome-editing applications&rdquo; as an alternative to zinc-finger nucleases and transcription-activator&ndash;like effector nucleases. 
 
	That potential has been described as everything from treating diseases with a genetic component, to &ldquo;playing God&rdquo; by using the technology for permanent germline editing of human genomes. Over the past 18 months, at least four researcher-driven study groups have weighed the scientific, medical, legal, and ethical implications of gene editing.

On July 12, the National Academies  Human Gene-Editing Committee held its fourth meeting aimed at balancing the medical benefits and moral questions of germline gene editing.

The Academies in June recommended a go-slow approach to gene drives, which like CRISPR have raised questions about the potential for impacting not just individual organisms, but entire species and ecosystems. In addition, Three European groups the Federation of European Academies of Medicine, the UK Academy of Medical Sciences and the Acad mie Nationale de M dicine France held an April 28 workshop to discuss genome editing activity in the EU, and the need for a European regulatory framework to govern safe and acceptable use of human genome editing. But it produced no immediate recommendations.

In September 2015, the Hinxton Group international consortium cautiously recommended that human gene editing research proceed but not clinical applications:  We believe that while this technology has tremendous value to basic research and enormous potential for somatic clinical uses, it is not sufficiently developed to consider human genome editing for clinical reproductive purposes at this time. 

Early last year, 18 researchers met in Napa, Calif., to discuss the scientific, medical, legal, and ethical implications of gene editing. The Napa group included Nobel laureate David Baltimore, Ph.D., and George M. Church, Ph.D., of Harvard Medical School, who with Doudna are among co-founders of Editas Medicine, launched in 2013 to translate their genome editing research into new therapeutics. (Another Editas co-founder, Feng Zhang, Ph.D., of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, is defending 12 CRISPR-related patents awarded to him from a challenge by Charpentier and Doudna being heard in a U.S. Patent and Trademark Office  interference  proceeding.)

Doudna served as corresponding author for the group, which recommended in part that steps be taken to  strongly discourage any attempts at germline genome modification for clinical application in humans, while societal, environmental, and ethical implications of such activity are discussed among scientific and governmental organizations. 

In a Q&A posted on the blog of Paul Knoepfler, Ph.D., of UC Davis School of Medicine, 10 days before online publication of the Napa statement in Science, Dr. Church carved out his own view. He said he didn t think germline editing was either the next goal or next logical step for gene editing but might be an acceptable side-effect of treating genetic diseases early, safely, and effectively.

 I really don t know why people are singling out CRISPR as being different from every other research and clinical application,  Church told Clinical OMICs last month.  How is it different from gene therapy in general, or how is it different from therapies in general? All of them go through exactly the same process. 

That process, he said, is the clinical trials system designed to address the safety and efficacy of new products and technologies:  I don t see any new ethical problems.

Massachusetts  growth in biotech R&D jobs was only about half that of California, which produced 10,482 such jobs between 2007 and 2015, up 54.8%. However, California finished last year with fewer biotech R&D jobs than Massachusetts 29,616, according to MassBio.

Rounding out the top five job-creating states in biotech R&D since 2007 were New Jersey (5232 jobs), New York (2892), and Delaware (2891).

In biopharma manufacturing, MassBio said, Massachusetts last year recorded 10,616 jobs, up 6.3% from 9989 in 2014, and up more than one-third (33.6%) from the 7944 jobs the state had in 2006.

However, Massachusetts  biopharma manufacturing workforce was the nation s 10th largest. The leading state, California, had 47,986 biomanufacturing jobs in 2015, up 8.9% from 47,163 the previous year but only 1.7% above the 44,047 jobs recorded by the Golden State for 2006.

California also enjoyed the highest amount of biomanufacturing employment growth, with 3939 jobs created between 2006 and 2015, while Massachusetts ranked second with 2672 jobs, the report added. North Carolina (2275 jobs), Maryland (1741), and Texas (1597) rounded out the top five states.

According to the report, job data comes from both the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW) and data from privately owned companies.","Pharmaceuticals"

The international team of researchers has identified eight additional types of cancer linked to excess weight and obesity: stomach, liver, gallbladder, pancreas, ovary, meningioma (a type of brain tumor), thyroid cancer, and the blood cancer multiple myeloma.

In 2002 the same group produced substantial evidence that linked five other cancers to being overweight or obese: adenocarcinoma of the esophagus, kidney cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer in postmenopausal women, and uterine cancer. This new study reinforces the notion that limiting weight gain over the decades could help to reduce the risk of all 13 cancer types.

The findings from this study were published today in The New England Journal of Medicine in an article entitled  Body Fatness and Cancer Viewpoint of the IARC Working Group  and are based on a review of more than 1000 studies of excess weight and cancer risk.

""The burden of cancer due to being overweight or obese is more extensive than what has been assumed,"" explained Graham Colditz, M.D., Dr.P.H., a cancer prevention expert at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, who chaired the IARC Working Group. ""Many of the newly identified cancers linked to excess weight haven't been on people's radar screens as having a weight component.""

The IARC team believes that their new findings could have a significant bearing on the global population. Worldwide, an estimated 640 million adults and 110 million children are obese, including one-third of adults and children in the United States.

 Lifestyle factors such as eating a healthy diet, maintaining a healthy weight, and exercising, in addition to not smoking, can have a significant impact on reducing cancer risk,"" Dr. Colditz noted. ""Public health efforts to combat cancer should focus on these things that people have some control over.""

However, Dr. Colditz added that  losing weight is hard for many people. Rather than getting discouraged and giving up, those struggling to take off weight could instead focus on avoiding more weight gain.""

Interestingly, the investigators found that for most of the cancers on the newly expanded list, a positive dose response relationship exists, i.e., the higher the body mass index, or BMI, the greater the cancer risk. Moreover, the cancer risks associated with excess weight were similar for men and women and, when data were available, were consistent across geographic regions North America, Europe, Asia, and the Middle East.

In addition to providing data linking the excess weight to the additional cancer types, the researchers also looked to provide mechanisms as to why being overweight or obese can increase an individual s cancer risk. While there are numerous possible explanations, the scientists specifically noted that excess fat leads to an overproduction of estrogen, testosterone, and insulin and also promotes inflammation, all of which can drive cancer growth.

""Significant numbers of the U.S. and the world's population are overweight,"" Dr. Colditz concluded. ""This is another wake-up call. It's time to take our health and our diets seriously.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The gene for a lncRNA called Morrbid was identified in 2013 by Jorge Henao-Mejia, M.D., Ph.D., who is currently an assistant professor of Pathology and Laboratory Medicine in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. Subsequent work by Dr. Henao-Mejia and colleagues has identified the immune cells in which Morrbid is expressed. This work has also illuminated the mechanism by which Morrbid regulates immune cell lifespan.

This new work appeared August 15 in the journal Nature, in an article entitled,  The Long Non-coding RNA Morrbid Regulates Bim and Short-lived Myeloid Cell Lifespan.  The article clarifies how immune cells called myeloid cells neutrophils, eosinophils, and  classical  monocytes are regulated. According to the article s authors, precise regulation of the lifespan of these myeloid cells is critical to maintain protective immune responses while minimizing the deleterious consequences of prolonged inflammation.

""These cells are extremely short-lived less than 1 day and their life span is tightly regulated to meet the demands of an organism,"" said Dr. Henao-Mejia. ""If we understand the molecular mechanisms by which their life span is tightly regulated, perhaps we could correct it when the control goes awry or power it up, when needed.""

Morrbid regulates cell lifespan by controlling the expression of a nearby gene that in turn controls programmed cell death in response to the abundance of prosurvival cytokines and metabolites in the surrounding environment outside cells. Morrbid essentially overrides a signaling mechanism that prevents premature immune cell death.

 To control the lifespan of these cells, Morrbid regulates the transcription of its neighboring pro-apoptotic gene, Bcl2l11 (Bim), by promoting the enrichment of the PRC2 complex at the Bcl2l11 promoter to maintain this gene in a poised state,  wrote the authors of the Nature article.  Notably, Morrbid regulates this process in cis, enabling allele-specific control of Bcl2l11 transcription. 

Essentially, in the highly inflammatory myeloid cells, changes in Morrbid levels provide a locus-specific regulatory mechanism that allows for rapid control of apoptosis in response to extracellular prosurvival signals.

By deleting Morrbid in mice, Dr. Henao-Mejia and colleagues instigated a drastic reduction in the frequency of immune cells that normally express Morrbid. Therefore, the mice had less ability to fight infection but gained protection against inflammation.

The expression of the human version of the gene, MORRBID, is impaired in patients with hypereosinophilic syndrome, in which the lifespan of some immune cells is not kept in check, causing inflammation and organ damage. ""Knowing this, Morrbid might be a good drug target for this uncommon disease and maybe even has a potential role for chronic diseases like asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, obesity, or cancer, all of which have an errant inflammatory component to their symptoms,"" noted Dr. Henao-Mejia. ""In the near future, we would like to concentrate our efforts to develop strategies to modulate the function of MORRBID in human cells as an effective therapeutic tool against inflammatory disease.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The findings add to previous studies that have identified genes linked to coffee habits and shed new light on the biological mechanisms of caffeine metabolism.

Researchers looked at genetic information from 370 people living in a small village in southern Italy and 843 people from six villages in northeastern Italy.  Each of the study participants was asked to complete a survey that included a question about how many cups of coffee they drank each day.

The team found that people with the PDSS2 variation tended to consume fewer cups of coffee than people without the variation. The effect was equivalent to around one fewer cup of coffee per day on average. The investigators replicated the study in a group of 1731 people from The Netherlands. The result was similar, but the effect of the gene on the number of cups of coffee consumed was slightly lower. This could be because of the different styles of coffee that are consumed in the two countries, the researchers say. In Italy, people tend to drink smaller cups such as espresso whereas in The Netherlands the preference is toward larger cups that contain more caffeine overall.

The study was conducted at the Universities of Edinburgh and Trieste, the Burlo Garofolo Pediatric Institute in Italy, the Erasmus Medical Center, and PolyOmica, a data analysis company based in Groningen, The Netherlands.

Researchers from the Italian coffee company Illy also participated in the project, although the company did not offer financial support.

Nicola Pirastu, Ph.D., a Chancellor s Fellow at the University of Edinburgh s Usher Institute, noted that  The results of our study add to existing research suggesting that our drive to drink coffee may be embedded in our genes. We need to do larger studies to confirm the discovery and also to clarify the biological link between PDSS2 and coffee consumption. ","Pharmaceuticals"

"Literature Review: Going after Tumor-Specific Idiotypes with Small Peptides"," 
	Treatment of B-cell lymphomas with monoclonal antibodies, though promising in principle, has met with low success due to development of resistance over time. The tumor's resistance to the antibody is traced to the fact that individual tumors present unique and changing sets of epitopes associated with the malignancies in B-cell lymphomas, making anti-idiotypic therapy with traditional immunoglobulin G (IgG)-type antibodies highly impractical and ultimately unsuccessful, as such a traditional therapy would require a custom generation of anti-idiotype antibodies one patient at a time.

B-cell lymphomas express a functionally active and truly tumor-specific cell-surface product, the variable region of the B-cell receptor (BCR), otherwise known as idiotype. The tumor idiotype differs, however, from patient to patient, making it a technical challenge to exploit for therapy. We have developed a method of targeting idiotype by using a semisynthetic personalized therapeutic that is more practical to produce on a patient-by-patient basis than monoclonal antibodies. In this method, a small peptide with affinity for a tumor idiotype is identified by screening a library, chemically synthesized, and then affixed to the amino terminus of a premade IgG Fc protein. We demonstrate that the resultant semisynthetic anti-idiotype peptibodies kill tumor cells in vitro with specificity, trigger tumor cell phagocytosis by macrophages, and efficiently clear human lymphoma in a murine xenograft model. This method could be used to target tumor with true precision on a personalized basis.

Figure 1. Concept overview. (A) Tumor idiotype is the variable region of the BCR on the surface of lymphoma cells. It is unique to the tumor clone and distinct from the idiotype on other B-cell clones. Peptibodies cross-link idiotype, triggering BCR signaling, resulting in activation-induced cell death, and opsonize tumor cells with an IgG Fc domain, promoting tumor clearance mediated by innate immune effector cells. (B) Schematic of semisynthetic anti-idiotype peptibody production. A random peptide library is screened to identify peptide sequences with idiotype-specific binding, which are synthesized and affixed to the amino terminus of a premade recombinant IgG Fc domain.

Treatment of B-cell lymphomas with monoclonal antibodies, though promising in principle, has met with low success due to development of resistance over time. The tumor's resistance to the antibody is traced to the fact that individual tumors present unique and changing sets of epitopes associated with the malignancies in B-cell lymphomas, making anti-idiotypic therapy with traditional immunoglobulin G (IgG)-type antibodies highly impractical and ultimately unsuccessful, as such a traditional therapy would require a custom generation of anti-idiotype antibodies one patient at a time. Here, the team has provided a method of targeting lymphoma idiotype on a patient-specific basis by using semisynthetic anti-idiotype peptibodies (Figure 1). First, a recombinant murine IgG2a Fc domain was modified to carry an aminoterminal cysteine, which in turn served as a handle for a native chemical ligation later used to attach idiotype-binding peptides site selectively. The idiotype-binding peptides could in turn be easily identified through high-throughput screens of patient tumor cells against peptide libraries. In this manner, the peptibody combining an immunoglobulin Fc domain and malignant B-cell-specific peptide binder represents a therapeutic modality that is easier to scale up and personalize than a traditional monoclonal. Further, given that a single peptibody molecule can incorporate more than two antigen-binding domains, a higher avidity and cell-killing efficacy can be engineered. Finally, the peptibodies developed here were shown to kill tumor cells in vitro and to clear human lymphoma in a mouse xenograft model, thus offering a proof-of-principle for this novel therapeutic modality.

And now, thanks to innovations developed at the Department of Energy s Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, MOFs could become even more useful. They could help to reveal new structural details for a range of challenging molecules, including complex chemical compounds and, potentially, new drugs.

The Berkeley Lab researchers presented their work August 18 in the journal Science, in an article entitled,  Coordinative Alignment of Molecules in Chiral Metal-Organic Frameworks.  The article describes how the researchers used a chiral MOF, MOF-520, to coordinatively bind and align molecules of varying size, complexity, and functionality.

 The reduced motional degrees of freedom obtained with this coordinative alignment method allowed the structures of molecules to be determined by single-crystal x-ray diffraction techniques,  wrote the article s authors.  The chirality of the MOF backbone also served as a reference in the structure solution for an unambiguous assignment of the absolute configuration of bound molecules. 

The MOFs used in the current study measured about 100 millionths of a meter across. They were identical and easy to manufacture in large numbers, and they provided a sort of backbone for the sample molecules that held them still for the X-ray studies the molecules otherwise can be wobbly and difficult to stabilize. The researchers prepared the samples by dipping the MOFs into solutions containing different molecular mixes and then heating them until they crystallized.

""We wanted to demonstrate that any of these molecules, no matter how complex, can be incorporated and their structure determined inside the MOFs,"" said Omar Yaghi, Ph.D., a materials scientist at Berkeley Lab and chemistry professor at UC Berkeley who led the research.

The MOFs also possess a particular handedness known as chirality like a left-handed person vs. a right-handed person that selectively binds with molecular samples that also possess this handedness. The difference in a molecule's handedness is particularly important for pharmaceuticals, as it can mean the difference between a medicine and a poison.

 Sixteen molecules representing four common functional groups (primary alcohol, phenol, vicinal diol, and carboxylic acid), ranging in complexity from methanol to plant hormones (gibberellins, containing eight stereocenters), were crystallized and had their precise structure determined,  the article s authors reported.  We distinguished single and double bonds in gibberellins, and we enantioselectively crystallized racemic jasmonic acid, whose absolute configuration had only been inferred from derivatives. 

Importantly, the MOFs in the latest study did not appear to distort the natural, intact structure of the molecules. The researchers asserted that with their method it is possible to determine the complete 3D structure of a molecule, even if the samples only fill about 30% of a MOF's pores. Also, the metals in the MOF framework itself can actually serve to enhance the quality of the X-ray images. According to the researchers, in one case, the technique allowed two nearly identical plant hormones to be distinguished on the basis of the difference in a single atomic bond.

""To crystallize a molecule typically involves a trial-and-error method,"" explained Dr. Yaghi. ""Every chemist and biologist has to submit to this process. But in this MOF material you don't need all that it traps the molecule and orders it. It's a way to bypass that trial-and-error approach to crystallography.""","Pharmaceuticals"

In the past several years, researchers have published findings linking various mutant genes to cases that fall within the autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, these studies only account for a small number of ASD cases, and scientists are still unclear as to how these particular genetic mutations arise. Now, investigators at Drexel University have published evidence that several chemicals used in certain pesticides and as insulating material banned in the 1970s may still be haunting us hypothesizing a link between higher levels of exposure to these chemicals during pregnancy and significantly increased odds of ASD in children.

The Drexel team found that children born after being exposed to the highest levels of organochlorine chemicals during their mother's pregnancy were roughly 80% more likely to be diagnosed with autism when compared to individuals with the very lowest levels of these chemicals. Although production of organochlorine chemicals was banned in the United States in 1977, these compounds have been shown to remain in the environment and become absorbed in the fat of animals that humans eat, leading to exposure.

This led the research team to look at organochlorine chemicals during pregnancy because they can cross the placenta barrier and affect the fetus' neurodevelopment.

""There's a fair amount of research examining exposure to these chemicals during pregnancy in association with other outcomes, like birth weight but little research on autism, specifically,"" explained Kristen Lyall, Sc.D., assistant professor in Drexel University's A.J. Drexel Autism Institute. ""To examine the role of environmental exposures in risk of autism, it is important that samples are collected during time frames with evidence for susceptibility for autism termed 'critical windows' in neurodevelopment. Fetal development is one of those critical windows.""

The research team looked at a population sample of 1144 children born in southern California between 2000 and 2003. Data was accrued from mothers who had enrolled in California's Expanded Alphafetoprotein Prenatal Screening Program, which is dedicated to detecting birth defects during pregnancy. The participants' children were separated into three groups: 545 who were diagnosed with ASD, 181 with intellectual disabilities but no autism diagnosis, and 418 with a diagnosis of neither.

The findings from this study were published recently in Environmental Health Perspectives in an article entitled  Polychlorinated Biphenyl and Organochlorine Pesticide Concentrations in Maternal Mid-Pregnancy Serum Samples: Association with Autism Spectrum Disorder and Intellectual Disability.""

Blood tests were taken from mothers in their second trimester and used to determine the level of exposure to two different classes of organochlorine chemicals: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs, which were used as lubricants, coolants, and insulators in consumer and electrical products) and organochlorine pesticides (OCPs, which include chemicals like DDT).

""Exposure to PCBs and OCPs is ubiquitous,"" Dr. Lyall noted. ""Work from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, which includes pregnant women, shows that people in the U.S. generally still have measurable levels of these chemicals in their bodies.""

Yet, the exposure levels seemed to be key in determining risk, with Dr. Lyall emphasizing that  adverse effects are related to levels of exposure, not just presence or absence of detectable levels. In our southern California study population, we found evidence for modestly increased risk for individuals in the highest 25th percentile of exposure to some of these chemicals.""

Interestingly, the investigators found that two compounds in particular PCB138/158 and PCB153 stood out as being significantly linked with autism risk. Children with the highest in utero levels of these two forms of PCBs were between 79% and 82% more likely to have an autism diagnosis than those found to be exposed to the lowest levels. High levels of two other compounds, PCB170 and PCB180, were also associated with children being approximately 50% more likely to be diagnosed.

""The results suggest that prenatal exposure to these chemicals above a certain level may influence neurodevelopment in adverse ways,"" Dr. Lyall concluded. ""We are definitely doing more research to build on this including work examining genetics, as well as mixtures of chemicals. This investigation draws from a rich dataset, and we need more studies like this in autism research.""","Pharmaceuticals"

ProMetic is a biopharma specializing in bioseparations, plasma-derived therapeutics, and small-molecule drug development. The company aims to develop novel small-molecule therapeutics targeting unmet medical needs in the field of fibrosis, anemia, neutropenia, cancer, and autoimmune diseases/inflammation, as well as certain nephropathies.

Headquartered in Laval, QC, Canada, ProMetic has R&D facilities in the U.K., the U.S., and Canada; manufacturing facilities in the U.K.; and commercial activities in the U.S., Europe, Russia, Asia, and Australia.

Prometic said in a statement that the acquisition would benefit the company by allowing for future expansion of a 150,000 square-foot facility in Belleville, Ontario, thus expanding its presence in Canada.

The deal comes less than a month after Telesta disclosed plans to shrink its workforce to 15 full-time employees from 32 as of June 30, and 50 as of March 31. Another four employees were to be retained at Telesta s two manufacturing facilities, which the company said it would sell. Telesta on August 2 also said it was terminating its European rights agreement with Ipsen for the bladder cancer treatment Mycobacterium phlei cell wall-nucleic acid complex (MCNA), as well as continuing to assess strategic options and cut costs.

In March, Telesta announced a 15% workforce reduction, saying it needed to cut costs as it reviewed strategic options. That reduction in force followed receipt of a Complete Response Letter from the FDA concerning its Biologics License Application (BLA) for MCNA. In the letter, the FDA said Telesta would need to complete another Phase III trial to establish the candidate s safety and efficacy.

The Complete Response Letter ended earlier plans by the agency to decide on the BLA by MCNA s Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA) review goal date of February 27.

In its most recent results covering the company s third fiscal quarter ending March 31, released May 10, Telesta said it generated a net loss of $1.6 million, compared with a $3.3 million loss a year earlier.

ProMetic said the deal will give it approximately $34 million cash toward drug development and clinical programs as well as  value generating activities,  while generating up to $50 million in potential tax attributes.

Under the deal, ProMetic will acquire all shares of Telesta for 14 cents a share, double its last traded price on the Toronto Stock Exchange of 7 cents a share. The transaction also includes a mutual $2.5 million breakup fee payable by Telesta or ProMetic in specified circumstances.

ProMetic said its planned purchase of Telesta will not materially affect its EBIDTA and operating cash flows.

The acquisition is expected to close in November, subject to approval by Telesta shareholders and customary closing conditions that include court and regulatory approvals, including the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange.","Pharmaceuticals"

""Latinos live longer than Caucasians, despite experiencing higher rates of diabetes and other diseases. Scientists refer to this as the 'Hispanic paradox,' "" said Dr. Horvath. ""Our study helps explain this by demonstrating that Latinos age more slowly at the molecular level.""

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Latinos in the United States live an average of 3 years longer than Caucasians, with a life expectancy of 82 versus 79. At any age, healthy Latino adults face a 30% lower risk of death than other ethnic groups, noted a 2013 study in the American Journal of Public Health.

The UCLA team used several biomarkers, including an ""epigenetic clock"" developed by Dr. Horvath in 2013, to track an epigenetic shift in the genome that's linked to aging.

""Our findings show that ethnic disparities in health risk are not just due to socioeconomic differences, which we adjust for in the analyses,"" explained co-author Michael Gurven, Ph.D.,  a University of California, Santa Barbara professor of anthropology. ""The epigenetic analyses show biological differences in aging-related processes, but in a novel way, in how the genome is maintained and expressed through methylation, rather than conventional differences in genetic alleles.""

Dr. Horvath  and his colleagues analyzed 18 sets of data on DNA samples from nearly 6000 people. The participants represented seven ethnicities: two African groups, African-Americans, Caucasians, East Asians, Latinos, and an indigenous people called the Tsimane, who are genetically related to Latinos. The Tsimane live in Bolivia.

When the scientists examined the DNA from blood, which reveals the health of a person's immune system, they were struck by differences linked to ethnicity. In particular, the scientists noticed that, after accounting for differences in cell composition, the blood of Latinos and the Tsimane aged more slowly than that of other groups.

According to Dr. Horvath, the UCLA research points to an epigenetic explanation for Latinos' longer life spans. For example, the biological clock measured Latino women's age as 2.4 years younger than non-Latino women of the same age after menopause.

""We suspect that Latinos' slower aging rate helps neutralize their higher health risks, particularly those related to obesity and inflammation,"" said Dr. Horvath, who is also a professor of biostatistics at the UCLA Fielding School of Public Health. ""Our findings strongly suggest that genetic or environmental factors linked to ethnicity may influence how quickly a person ages and how long they live.""

""Epigenetic aging measures are fascinating because they subsume many environmental and psychosocial factors we know matter in life. One hypothesis to explain the Hispanic paradox emphasizes the strong family ties and social support found in many Hispanic families. Such a social support network may leave its biological signature in the epigenome,"" added Dr. Gurven.

The Tsimane aged even more slowly than Latinos. The biological clock calculated the age of their blood as 2 years younger than Latinos and 4 years younger than Caucasians. This possibly reflects the group's minimal signs of heart disease, diabetes, hypertension, or obesity, the researchers said.

""Despite frequent infections, the Tsimane people show very little evidence of the chronic diseases that commonly afflict modern society,"" Dr. Gurven said. ""Our findings provide an interesting molecular explanation for their robust health.""

In another finding, the researchers learned that men's blood and brain tissue ages faster than women's from the same ethnic groups. The discovery could explain why women have a higher life expectancy than men.","Pharmaceuticals"

Moreover, enabling biomedical experts to efficiently use big data processing pipelines is another challenge.

As translational medicine data become more and more rich and complex, their potential in informing both clinical and basic research grows. With constantly increasing presence of high-throughput molecular profiling, it becomes increasingly important to ensure that data interpretation capabilities follow generation of large-scale biomedical data sets. Visualization can support greatly the processing of complex data sets on each of the steps of the data life cycle. This opportunity is actively explored in various domains of biomedical research, including clinical big data or multiscale biomedical ontologies.

Modern translational medicine approaches aim to combine clinical and molecular profiles of the patients to formulate informed hypothesis on the basis of stratified data. Integration of plethora of sources renders these data sets complex and difficult to process. Visualization of such integrated data sets can aid exploration and selection of key dimensions and subsets for downstream analysis. In turn, visually aided data analysis allows to comprehend even complicated workflows and aids interpretation of resulting data.

In this article, we demonstrate a workflow for translational medicine big data, in which visualization is an important component at each step of data processing and exploration. We describe in detail the interfaces allowing the construction of the workflow, followed up by a use case scenario. We conclude with a discussion of the results and an outlook for future development of visualization in biomedical big data exploration.

Carlos Cordon-Cardo, M.D., Ph.D., will oversee the new center, located at Mount Sinai St. Luke s, and will continue his role as chair of the department of pathology at the Mount Sinai Health System and professor of pathology, genetics and genomic sciences, and oncological sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine.

Gerardo Fernandez, M.D., associate professor of pathology, and genetics and genomic sciences at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, will be the center s medical director.  He will work closely with Michael Donovan, M.D., Ph.D., research professor of pathology at the Icahn School of Medicine, and Jack Zeineh, M.D., director of technology for Precise MD.

 Our goal is to provide a precise mathematical approach to classifying and treating disease, which will assist our clinicians with information for effective patient care and health management,  says Dr. Cordon-Cardo.   By refining diagnoses, we can save patients from unnecessary treatments. 

Precise MD is developing new approaches to characterizing an individual s cancer by combining multiple data sources and analyzing them with mathematical algorithms, offering a more sophisticated alternative to standard approaches.  One such example is Precise MD s approach to improve upon the Gleason score, a grading system that has been used since the 1960s to establish the prognosis for a prostate cancer and guide the patient s treatment options.

 We re characterizing tumors based on the combination of their architectural patterns and biomarkers,  says Dr. Fernandez.  Computer vision analysis, leveraging multispectral fluorescence microscopic imaging, enables us to see what the human eye cannot. 

In its initial phase this summer, Precise MD will complete a test used for patients who have had prostatectomies at Mount Sinai Health System, to help determine which of them are more likely to have a recurrence of cancer and may need additional therapy such as chemotherapy.

 Precise MD s approach gives us an in-depth knowledge about biological behavior of prostate cancer and allows us to choose appropriate patients for active surveillance,  says Ash Tewari, M.D., chair of the department of urology at the Mount Sinai Health System and the Kyung Hyun Kim, M.D., professor of urology at the Icahn School of Medicine.   Due to their support, we have a large pool of patients who are with active surveillance.

These miRNA-containing vesicles amount to a microscopic artillery barrage that softens resistance in the dermis, inducing morphological changes in preparation for receiving and transporting the cancer cells.

The TAU researchers also considered the feasibility countermeasures. The researchers found chemical substances that can stop the process and are therefore promising drug candidates.

Details appeared August 22 in the journal Nature Cell Biology, in an article entitled,  Melanoma miRNA Trafficking Controls Tumour Primary Niche Formation.  The article describes how the TAU researchers began by examining pathology samples taken from melanoma patients. ""We looked at samples of early melanoma, before the invasive stage,"" reported Carmit Levy, Ph.D., a researcher in the Department of Human Genetics and Biochemistry at TAU's Sackler School of Medicine. ""To our surprise we found changes in the morphology of the dermis the inner layer of the skin that had never before been reported. Our next task was to find out what these changes were, and how they related to melanoma.""

The TAU researchers revealed that melanoma cells directly affect the formation of the dermal tumor niche by miRNA trafficking before invasion. The researchers paid particular attention to melanocytes, cells of melanoma origin, that are specialized in releasing pigment vesicles, termed melanosomes.

 In melanoma in situ, we found melanosome markers in distal fibroblasts before melanoma invasion,  wrote the authors of the Nature Cell Biology article.  The melanosomes carry microRNAs into primary fibroblasts triggering changes, including increased proliferation, migration and pro-inflammatory gene expression, all known features of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs). 

The melanosomes, the scientists explained, induce morphological changes in the dermis in preparation for receiving and transporting the cancer cells. ""Specifically, melanosomal microRNA-211 directly targets IGF2R [insulin-like growth factor 2 receptor] and leads to MAPK [mitogen-activated protein kinase] signaling activation, which reciprocally encourages melanoma growth.""

Having discovered the mechanism, the researchers proceeded to look for substances that could intervene and block the process in its earliest stages. They found two such chemicals: one (SB202190) inhibits the delivery of the vesicles from the melanoma tumor to the dermis; and the other (U0126) prevents the morphological changes in the dermis even after the arrival of the vesicles. Both substances were tested successfully in the lab, and may serve as promising candidates for future drugs. In addition, the changes in the dermis, as well as the vesicles themselves, can be used as powerful indicators for early diagnosis of melanoma.

""Our study is an important step on the road to a full remedy for the deadliest skin cancer,"" concluded Dr. Levy. ""We hope that our findings will help turn melanoma into a nonthreatening, easily curable disease.""","Pharmaceuticals"

The clinical setbacks are the second and third reported by Tokai for galeterone in less than a month.

On July 26, the company said it was ending its Phase III ARMOR3-SV trial comparing galeterone to enzalutamide in treatment-na ve mCRPC patients whose prostate tumors express the AR-V7 splice variant, at the recommendation of the trial s independent Data Monitoring Committee.

The committee concluded that ARMOR3-SV would not meet its primary endpoint of showing improved radiographic progression-free survival for galeterone versus enzalutamide.

 Tokai is continuing to evaluate the unblinded data from its recently discontinued ARMOR3 clinical trial,  the company said yesterday, adding that it  is assessing potential next steps in its galeterone program. 

Three days after announcing the failure of SRMOR3-SV, Tokai said it was eliminating about 60% of its workforce, shrinking its staff to 10 full-time equivalent employees by the end of the third quarter. The company said it expected the job cuts to generate approximately $4.2 million in reduced annualized operating expenses, following a third-quarter charge of approximately $1.3 million.

 This workforce reduction is designed to reduce operating expenses while the company conducts a comprehensive evaluation of strategic options for galeterone and its pipeline. 

Galeterone is an oral small molecule designed to work by using the pathways of current therapies, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone, as well as through androgen receptor degradation intended to decrease their sensitivity to androgen activity and thus reduce tumor growth.

Tokai has worldwide development and commercialization rights to galeterone, which is indicated for mCRPC patients.

News of the latest clinical setbacks sent the price of Tokai shares slipping nearly 18% from yesterday s closing price of $1.36 to $1.12 as of 9:01 a.m.","Pharmaceuticals"

Otulipenia is caused by the malfunction of OTULIN, a single gene on chromosome 5. When functioning properly, OTULIN regulates the development of new blood vessels and the mobilization of cells and proteins to fight infection. The researchers published their study (""Biallelic Hypomorphic Mutations in a Linear Deubiquitinase Define Otulipenia, an Early-onset Autoinflammatory Disease"") in PNAS.

Contributing to the work were researchers from the National Human Genome Research Institute (NHGRI), the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases, the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, and the NIH Clinical Center, all part of NIH, along with their colleagues in Turkey and the U.K.

""The results have been amazing and life changing for these children and their families,"" said Daniel Kastner, M.D., Ph.D., co-author, NHGRI scientific director and head of NHGRI's Inflammatory Disease Section. ""We have achieved the important goal of helping these young patients and made progress in understanding the biological pathways and proteins that are important for the regulation of the immune system's responses.""

Otulipenia is one of several inflammatory diseases that occur when the immune system attacks the host's own tissues. Inflammation is the body's natural response to invading bacteria or viruses. The body releases chemicals that cause blood vessels to leak and tissues to swell in order to isolate a foreign substance from further contact with the body's tissues. Inflammatory diseases affecting the whole body are caused by mutations in genes like OTULIN that are part of a person's innate immunity.

An international network of scientists studying inflammatory diseases identified four children from Pakistani and Turkish families with unexplained skin rashes and inflamed joints. NIH scientists then searched for disease-causing genes using next-generation DNA sequencing, technology that allows researchers to sequence DNA quickly and economically.

Once they found that the OTULIN gene was abnormal in the sick children, they studied the immune pathway to understand the mechanisms of disease and to improve treatment of these patients. They discovered a problem in the processing of a small protein, ubiquitin, which is critical to the regulation of many other proteins in the body, including immune molecules. In the affected children, the inability to remove the ubiquitin proteins from various molecules resulted in an increased production of inflammatory cytokines.

The researchers determined that the children with otulipenia might respond to drugs that turned off tumor necrosis factor (TNF), a chemical messenger involved in systemic inflammation. Inflammation subsided in the children who had been treated with TNF inhibitors, which are also used to treat chronic inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.

""The malfunction in this protein has not been previously linked to clinical disorders of the human immune system,"" said Ivona Aksentijevich, M.D., staff scientist in NHGRI's Medical Genetics Branch and study co-author. ""This discovery suggests a direction that can be explored for development of new therapies for patients with a wide range of inflammatory diseases.""

This advanced sequencing technique has dramatically altered the field of genomic medicine in the past several years, allowing researchers to plumb the true depths of the human genome and rapidly apply the knowledge to drug discovery and disease treatment.

However, for all the power and speed NGS possesses, the technology is not without its limitations. To achieve high-throughput rates, NGS platforms break genomic sequences down into short read lengths (30 to 400 base pairs), which makes it difficult to reassemble the fragments in the proper order, given there is only a four-letter alphabet for the genetic code.

For instance, imagine if you had 100 copies of the Door s 1967 debut album and, in a moment of temporary insanity, you decide to throw them all into a giant blender (will it blend?) and hit frappe. After the grinding stops, and you come out of your mad state, you realize there is a way to reassemble the tiny pieces and make the albums complete again, although you quickly surmise that if the pieces of the album were larger you would be able to play longer segments of the songs and tell which snippet went where. The smaller segments only allow you to hear a quick bit of instrument, a momentary blurb of vocals, or possibly only a single note making the assembly profoundly more challenging and prone to errors.

The record shredding analogy underscores an inherent weaknesses of NGS technology, that scientists and platform manufacturers are continually seeking to improve in order to increase read lengths on their sequencers. However, another inborn problem of NGS lies within an integral portion of most advanced sequencing modalities: nucleotide amplification by PCR. High-fidelity polymerases that are most often used to construct NGS libraries introduce errors in roughly four bases out of a million. Though that may seem like an insignificant amount, when searching the genome for single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) a variant of one DNA base between sequences the PCR-introduced errors can become extremely problematic.

Investigators like Evgeny Nudler, Ph.D., professor of biochemistry at New York University School of Medicine, whose laboratory focuses on bacterial evolution, adaptation, and development

 of antibiotic resistance, are keenly aware of the difficulties studying de novo mutations in microbial species using high-throughput sequencing techniques. E. coli produce 1,000 fold fewer errors in their DNA (1 in 109 bases) than the DNA polymerases used for amplification. Combined with the fact that various NGS platforms can misread approximately 1 in 1,000 bases, Nudler, and his colleagues realized they needed to devise a new technique with enough accuracy if they hoped to reveal how bacteria use rapid evolution to defeat antibiotics.

 The initial motivation to develop (a new) technique was to measure the mutational rate directly in bacteria,  Dr. Nudler told Clinical OMICS.  We are a microbiology lab, and we wanted to understand the fundamental questions of the rate of mutation and the mechanism of bacterial mutations, but all of the traditional approaches to address these questions they required selection in order to see the mutations like a marker. 

Nudler continued, saying  but these approaches ignore a large number of variants and only allow you to focus on one subset of mutations. Researchers have been searching for decades for an unbiased method to measure the mutation rate.

"Mending of Chromosomal Split Ends Seen in Real Time","

These observations reveal that a kind of two-step diffusion process takes place during telomere repair. In the first step, telomerase diffuses evenly through the nucleus. When it happens to hit anywhere on a telomere, it sticks briefly, thus increasing the concentration of telomerase near telomeres. In the second step, telomerase already in the neighborhood of the telomere ends diffuses again, but this time with an increased chance of hitting a telomere end, where a secure and relatively long-lived attachment can be made.

These telomere repair dynamics were uncovered by scientists based at the University of Colorado. They used CRISPR DNA-editing technology to insert code into the gene that makes telomerase. This inserted code manufactured a fluorescent protein, which was attached to telomerase. The scientists then used what some call nanoscopy to see this fluorescent protein.

Details of the work appeared August 11 in the journal Cell, in an article entitled,  Live Cell Imaging Reveals the Dynamics of Telomerase Recruitment to Telomeres.  The article made a point of noting that in cancer research, telomere repair is of particular interest, because it can endow cancer cells with immortality. A better understanding of telomere repair dynamics, the article s authors realized, could point to more effective therapies against cancer.

 We demonstrate that telomerase uses three-dimensional diffusion to search for telomeres, probing each telomere thousands of times each S-phase but only rarely forming a stable association,  the article s authors wrote.  Both the transient and stable association events depend on the direct interaction of the telomerase protein TERT [telomerase reverse transcriptase] with the telomeric protein TPP1. 

Without live-cell imaging, a version of which was used in the current study, looking close enough to see the fluorescence of a single protein would have required ""fixing"" the cell and visualizing it with a microscope. It would have been a snapshot. The ability to see the processes inside a live cell at this magnification is like shooting video.

""The amazing thing to me is that 3 years ago, you couldn't have done any of this. This is how fast things are moving in biology, just rocketing ahead,"" said the article s senior author, Thomas Cech, Ph.D., CU Boulder Distinguished Professor, Nobel laureate, and director of CU's BioFrontiers Institute.  With this fixed cell imaging, we didn't see the dynamics. And the rapidly diffusing telomerase is invisible, washed out, or lost in the background. 

Dr. Cech suggests that this technique of CRISPR-aided nanoscopy will likely be used by scientists outside the field of telomere research. He also hopes this specific finding will aid in screening anti-telomerase drugs.

""Right now we don't have a great telomerase inhibitor. We don't know at which step our first generation of these drugs is interfering so we don't know how to optimize these drug candidates for anticancer effect,"" Dr. Cech explained. ""Does a drug prevent the assembly of telomerase? Does it keep telomerase from moving near telomeres? Does it prevent probing? Does it prevent telomerase from finding a telomere end?

""Knowing where a drug blocks the ability of telomerase to lengthen telomeres could have broad applicability for diverse cancers,"" Dr. Cech added.","Pharmaceuticals"

This could provide a paradigm shift in the field. Our study suggests that in eye melanoma the pigmentation difference may play a direct cancer-driving role not related to sunlight protection.""

Close to 2500 people are diagnosed with uveal melanoma in the United States annually. Unlike other solid tumors, there has been limited progress in understanding the contribution of genetic risk factors to the development of uveal melanoma. Many researchers suggest that this is primarily due to the absence of comprehensive genetic data from patients because large sample cohorts for this rare cancer type have not been available for research.

To overcome these limitations, researchers analyzed samples from more than 270 patients with uveal melanoma. Because there is a known clinical connection between eye melanoma and skin cancer, the researchers sought to determine whether there were commonly shared genetic factors between both diseases analogous to the inherited genetic risk for skin melanoma, which has been more extensively explored in the previous medical literature.

The findings from this study were published recently in Scientific Reports in an article entitled  Genetic Markers of Pigmentation Are Novel Risk Loci for Uveal Melanoma. 

The research team analyzed 29 inherited genetic mutations previously linked with skin melanoma to determine if there was an associated risk of uveal melanoma. Interestingly, the analysis uncovered that five genetic mutations were significantly associated with uveal melanoma risk. Moreover, the three most significant genetic associations occurred in a genetic region that determines eye color.

""Genetic susceptibility to uveal melanoma has been traditionally thought to be restricted only to small groups of patients with family history,  noted co-senior study author Tomas Kirchoff, Ph.D., assistant professor at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU School of Medicine.  Now our strong data shows the presence of novel genetic risk factors associated with this disease in a general population of uveal melanoma patients. But this data is also important because it indicates for the first time that there is a shared genetic susceptibility to both skin and uveal melanoma mediated by genetic determination of eye color. This knowledge may have direct implications for the deeper molecular understanding of both diseases.""

The investigators are optimistic that their findings will fuel the formation of large national and international research consortiums to conduct comprehensive, systematic analysis of inherited (germline) genome data in large cohorts of uveal melanoma patients.

""This type of collaboration is critically needed to dissect additional modifying genetic risk factors that may be uveal melanoma specific,  Dr. Kirchhoff remarked.  This has significant consequences not only for the prevention or early diagnosis of the disease but potentially for more improved therapies for at-risk patients.""

Dr. Abdel-Rahman added that ""federal funding will be crucial to support research of rare cancers such as eye melanoma as it is likely, as shown in this study, that the impact of such research will extend across the different cancer types.""","Pharmaceuticals"

 The addition of Medivation will strengthen Pfizer s Innovative Health business and accelerate its pathway to a leadership position in oncology, one of our key focus areas, which we believe will drive greater growth and scale of that business over the long-term,  Pfizer Chairman and CEO Ian Read said in a statement.

Medivation s cancer franchise is anchored by its marketed prostate cancer drug Xtandi  (enzalutamide), which has generated approximately $2.2 billion in worldwide net sales over the past four quarters, according to figures by development partner Astellas Pharma. But Medivation has come under criticism over Xtandi because of its high wholesale list price in the U.S. of $129,000 for a year s course of treatment.

Medivation s cancer pipeline includes two additional oncology candidates. One is the Phase III candidate talazoparib (MDV3800), an orally available poly(ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor now in a pivotal trial in patients with germline BRCA (gBRCA) mutated breast cancer.

The other candidate, pidilizumab (MDV9300), is an antibody with immune-mediated antitumor effects licensed from CureTech. Medivation has said it plans to develop pidilizumab in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma and other hematologic malignancies, such as multiple myeloma.

The companies said pidilizumab has the potential to be combined with immune-oncology therapies in Pfizer s portfolio. Among them is avelumab, a PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor being co-developed through an up-to-$2.85 billion alliance with Merck KGaA, and for which the Phase III JAVELIN Ovarian 100 trial was launched in July. The trial is intended to assess avelumab in combination with, and/or as follow-on (maintenance) treatment to, platinum-based chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease (Stage III or Stage IV) with previously untreated epithelial ovarian cancer.

 We believe that Pfizer is the ideal partner to extend the reach of our blockbuster Xtandi franchise and take our promising, late-stage assets talazoparib and pidiluzimab to their next stages of development so that they can be made available to patients as quickly as possible,  added David Hung, M.D., Medivation founder, president and CEO.

At $81.50 a share, Pfizer s offer marks a 21% premium over Medivation s Friday closing share price of $67.19, and a 55% premium over Sanofi s first offer for Medivation of $52.50 a share, or $9.3 billion.

Medivation rejected Sanofi s first offer in June, and a month later turned down a sweetened $10 billion offer consisting of $58 per share in cash and a $3 per share contingent value right tied to sales of talazoparib.

The companies expect their deal to close in the third or fourth quarter, subject to customary closing conditions that include U.S. antitrust clearance and the tender of a majority of the outstanding shares of Medivation common stock.

Pfizer said it will finance the acquisition with existing cash. The boards of both Pfizer and Medivation have unanimously approved the deal, which is expected to immediately add 5 cents to Pfizer s adjusted diluted earnings per share (EPS) in the first full year after closing, with additional accretion and growth anticipated thereafter.

Pfizer said it does not expect the acquisition to impact its current 2016 financial guidance, which the company reaffirmed on August 2. Pfizer has told investors it anticipates adjusted diluted EPS of $2.38 to $2.48 on revenues of between $51 billion to $53 billion.","Pharmaceuticals"

The novel method, called MAPseq (Multiplexed Analysis of Projections by Sequencing), makes it possible in a single experiment to trace the long-range projections of large numbers of individual neurons from a specific region or regions to wherever they lead in the brain. The results, the researchers say, are experiments that are many times less expensive, labor-intensive, and time-consuming than current mapping technologies allow.

Although a number of important brain-mapping projects are now under way, all of these efforts to obtain connectomes, or wiring maps, rely upon microscopes and related optical equipment to trace the myriad thread-like projections that link neurons to other neurons, near and far. For the first time ever, MAPseq ""converts the task of brain mapping into one of RNA sequencing,"" says its inventor, Anthony Zador, M.D., Ph.D., professor at Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory. ""The RNA sequences, or 'barcodes,' that we deliver to individual neurons are unmistakably unique and this enables us to determine if individual neurons, as opposed to entire regions, are tailored to specific targets.""

MAPseq differs from so-called bulk tracing methods now in common use, he continues, in which a marker, typically a fluorescent protein, is expressed by neurons and carried along their axons. Such markers are good at determining all of the regions to which neurons in the source region project, but they cannot tell scientists that any two neurons in the source region project to the same region, to different regions, or to some of the same regions and some different ones. That inability to resolve a neuron's axonal destinations, cell by cell in a given region, is what motivated Dr. Zador to come up with a new technique.

One way of explaining the advantage of MAPseq over bulk tracing methods is to imagine being at an international airport, with the intention of getting on a flight to, say, Germany. ""If you go to the international terminal, you see a long line of ticket counters,"" Dr. Zador explains. ""If you want to go to Germany, it's not enough to take any airline at the international terminal. If you stand in line at the counter for Air Chile, you're probably not going to be able to buy a ticket for Germany.

""Those many airlines whose counters are adjacent serve many destinations, some of which overlap, some of which are unique. You can print out a map showing all of the foreign countries that all of the airlines serve from your airport, but that doesn't tell you anything at all about individual airlines and where they go. This is the difference between current labeling methods and MAPseq. The 'individual airlines' in my example are adjacent neurons in a part of the brain whose 'routes' we want to trace.""

Dr. Zador and his team, including Justus Kebschull, a graduate student in his lab who is first author on the Neuron paper introducing the new method, have spent several years working out a technology that enables them to assign unique barcode-like identifiers to large numbers of individual neurons via a single injection in any brain region of interest. Each injection consists of a deactivated virus that has been engineered to contain massive pools of individually unique RNA molecules, each of whose sequence, consisting of 30 nucleotides, is taken up by single neurons. Thirty letters yields many, many times more barcode sequences (1018) than there are neurons in either the mouse or human brain, so this method is especially well suited to the massive complexity problem that brain mapping presents.

An injection into a source region of the brain contains a viral library encoding a diverse collection of barcode sequences, which are hitched to an engineered protein that is designed to carry the barcode along axonal pathways. The barcode RNA is expressed at high levels and transported into the terminals of axons in the source region where the injection is made. In each neuron, it travels to the point where the axon forms a synapse with a projection from another neuron. Tests show that the technology works--the barcodes travel reliably and evenly throughout the brain, along the trunklines that are the axons--and out to the branch points where synapses form.

About 2 days after one or more injections are made in a region of interest, the brain is dissected and RNA is collected and sequenced. RNA barcodes in the source area are now matched with the same barcodes collected in distant parts of the brain.

""Sequencing the RNA is a highly efficient, automated process, which makes MAPseq such a potentially radical tool,"" Kebschull says. ""In addition to the speed and economy of RNA sequencing, it has the great advantage of making it possible for researchers to distinguish between individual neurons within the same region that project to different parts of the brain.""

To demonstrate MAPseq's capabilities, Zador's team injected a part of the mouse brain called the locus coeruleus (LC), located in the brain stem. It is the cortex's sole source of noradrenaline, a hormone that signals surprise. Dr. Zador's team used MAPseq to address an old question: Does the ""surprise"" signal get broadcast everywhere in the cortex, or only to particular places, where, perhaps, it is most needed or relevant?

In their demonstration experiment, only RNA that ended up in the cortex or olfactory bulb was sequenced, along with that of the source region in the LC where the barcodes were originally injected. The team divided the cortex into 22 slices, each about 300 microns thick, and dissected the slices. The results were exciting to the team.

""We found that neurons in the LC have a variety of idiosyncratic projection patterns,"" notes Dr. Zador. ""Some neurons project almost exclusively to a single preferred target in the cortex or olfactory bulb. Other neurons project more broadly, although weakly.""

These results, he adds, ""are consistent with, and reconcile, previous seemingly contradictory results about LC projections."" The surprise signal can reach most parts of the brain, but there are very specific parts of the brain where the signal is especially focused.

The team showed that results could be obtained in experiments based on one injection in the LC, and also two injections, on opposite sides. Already in progress are experiments in which the entire cortex is being ""tiled"" with injections. It is hoped this will yield the first connectome of the entire cortex at single-neuron resolution.

""Once we automate the process of using many injections, we think this kind of experiment can be completed by a single person in just a week or two, and at a cost of only a few thousand dollars,"" according to Dr. Zador. ""We are very keen on being able to do these kind of studies in a single animal, which will eliminate the past problem of injecting multiple animals to trace multiple neurons, a method that requires one to make a single map based on many brains, each of which is somewhat different.""

Dr. Zador's next goal with MAPseq is to map the brains of animals that model various neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric illnesses, to see how gene mutations strongly associated with causality alter the structure of brain circuits, and thus, presumably, brain function.","Pharmaceuticals"

The initial offer fell through quickly, due in part to complications regarding Hershey's voting power and the local ties to the trust it funds. But many experts had yet to give up that a takeover could still be on the table as Hershey's trust went through its own series of changes.

Rosenfeld said in a statement that the company was disappointed with the outcome of the Hershey discussions but they ""(remain) disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions, and confident that our advantaged platform positions us well for top-tier performance over the long term.""

That assurance is critical at a time when Mondelez has made significant strides in cost-cutting, product development and market expansion. In the latest reported quarter, net revenues plunged 17.7%, though organic net revenue growth saw a 1.5% uptick.

Mondelez itself has been at the heart of takeover discussions at times as investors put pressure on the company to turn its performance around or sell itself. That narrative shifted when Mondelez put in its bid for Hershey. But now that that saga is over, such speculation could return or Mondelez could soon put in another offer for a different acquisition target.

After the decision was announced, the value of the pound plunged, so exports in food and beverage could also continue to rise.

Non-U.K. countries may consider taking advantage of the situation and capitalize on the improved purchasing power against the pound while they can. If U.S. manufacturers want to make a product with U.K. ingredients companies, now is the time.

However, U.K. manufacturers are not optimistic about the medium-term post-Brexit prospects for the industry worldwide, according to a July survey. About half of U.K. companies (45%) said it could take at least five years before the full extent of Brexit s consequences are apparent.

"Nobody likes BPA, but replacing it can be difficult"," From chemistry and cost to supply availability, manufacturers often have several hurdles to overcome when deciding to go BPA-free. ","http://www.fooddive.com/news/nobody-likes-bpa-but-replacing-it-can-be-difficult/425325/","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 10:45:53 -0400","NA","Nobody likes BPA, but replacing it can be difficultNobody likes BPA, but replacing it can be difficult Manufacturers struggle to find substitutes that will work for both their products and consumers

Manufacturers are working to meet consumer demands by paring down the ingredients in their food, making it simpler and with fewer additives and chemicals.

But the retooling and reformulation doesn't stop with them. Those who package food are also struggling with getting rid of chemicals that consumers are rejecting.

Most of the controversy is swirling around bisphenol A, which is commonly abbreviated as BPA. It's a chemical commonly found in the polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins used in plastic bottles and metal can linings. It is FDA-approved, but recent research has indicated that BPA may leach from food and beverage packaging into the products people consume. Researchers have linked BPA consumption to health risks, particularly for infants and children.

Manufacturers have responded committing to switch to BPA alternatives. In July 2015, ConAgra announced it had updated all of its U.S. and Canadian facilities to use only BPA-free packaging. This March, both Campbell and Del Monte committed to 100% phase out BPA in their own operations.

But switching to BPA alternatives isn t always simple, especially for companies like Campbell, which has canned foods of various acid levels and other factors that impact packaging material choices. Manufacturers have several factors to weigh when considering BPA-free packaging.

Del Monte began transitioning some vegetable, fruit and tomato products to BPA-free linings in 2009.

""Our focus has always been consumer-centric, and offering BPA-free packaging is part of our commitment towards meeting the evolving preferences of many consumers,"" Scott Butler, vice president of R&D, quality assurance and operation services at Del Monte, told Food Dive. ""It comes back to consumer preference and meeting the needs of people looking to put top quality food on their table.""

Thomas Hushen, Campbell s senior manager of external communications, told Food Dive that the company still supports using BPA in food packaging, since it has been backed by extensive scientific studies and government regulations.

""However, we recognize that there s been some debate over the use of BPA, which is why we re making this transition,"" he said.

Mike Schade, who runs the Mind the Store campaign for the Safer Chemicals, Healthy Families coalition, refers to the biggest stumbling block to replacing BPA as  regrettable substitutes.  Sometimes, he said, the BPA substitute can have its own set of drawbacks.

More than a third of all national-brand products Schade and his team tested used PVC plastic and PVC-based polymers, which could be a replacement for BPA.

However, it may not be any safer than BPA  because from production to disposal, PVC is considered to be a hazardous plastic,  Schade said.  It's made from known hazardous chemicals, such as vinyl chloride, ethylene dichloride and chlorine gas. Also, PVC is a large source of mercury dioxins in the environment. 

Styrene-based resins, also used in place of BPA, are a potential carcinogen, according to research.

But companies have found some alternatives that meet their needs and consumers  demands. Del Monte has converted to materials including polyester and vinyl, decisions the company based on ""the safety and effectiveness of the materials,"" Butler said.

In March 2016, Campbell introduced cans with linings made from acrylic or polyester materials, and the company will continue to introduce those new linings across its U.S. and Canada portfolio through 2017, Hushen said.

Once manufacturers find a safe BPA alternative, there are still other issues that need to be addressed.

The acidity of different products can cause different reactions to BPA and its alternatives. When a company as large and with as varied a portfolio as Campbell tries to replace the chemical, what works well for one product may not be successful for another.

Hushen said that Campbell has tested hundreds of alternatives, but dealt with several technical challenges. One of the larger ones is ""identifying linings that would ensure the safety of more than 600 different recipes, such as its tomato-based products, which are naturally acidic and can react with some linings over time,"" he said.

BPA alternatives may come with additional costs in materials, labor or shipping weight. However, cost isn't always a problem for manufacturers making the conversion.

""Packaging costs are just one of many variables that go into product pricing, and any rise or decline in pricing would not necessarily be tied to packaging costs,"" Butler said.

Hushen also said that Campbell did not plan on passing costs onto consumers, mirroring a similar sentiment at the time of Campbell s announcement to label GMO ingredients earlier this year.

Finding a safe alternative for BPA at a reasonable cost is important, but there needs to be a large enough supply to meet the manufacturer's demands. This may especially be a concern for major manufacturers, but Campbell and Del Monte both noted they had not had trouble sourcing the materials they chose.

Schade offered steps manufacturers can take when determining BPA alternatives for their packaging.

In 2015, the California Environmental Protection Agency added BPA to its list of chemicals requiring warning labels, as part of the state's Prop 65 law. This past March, it delayed those on-package warnings, saying retailers could post general warning signs at checkout counters to inform consumers of the presence of BPA in certain canned and bottled products.

Under that mandate, manufacturers must provide warning signs to retailers at no cost and notify each retailer to which products the it applies. But with a massive number of California retailers to contact, mailing or even emailing letters didn t seem like a practical way for manufacturers to reach all retailers.

The Grocery Manufacturers Association had a different solution: an online database where food and beverage manufacturers can list products with packaging that contains BPA to comply with the state law. The database enables communication between manufacturers, retailers and consumers. Retailers can more effectively direct consumers to information about products containing BPA sold in their stores, Mandy Hagan, vice president of state affairs and grassroots at GMA, told Food Dive.

But the database benefits manufacturers as much as retailers.

""This remedied what would have been an even bigger logistical problem for companies of putting those notices directly on the packaging,"" said Hagan. ""Not only because of how much lead time you need to change labels, but also because with the national distribution system that they have, those products would end up in other states where consumers aren't familiar with Prop 65 and wouldn't know what they're looking at.""

BPA alternatives and notifications for consumers are not always easy for manufacturers to implement. But if companies want to keep up with consumers  evolving health-related demands, BPA-free packaging may be something to consider.

""Making a change of this magnitude requires input from hundreds of employees across the company,"" said Hushen. ""It s not something that can be done quickly, nor would we want to. The safety of our food and our packaging is paramount. It s the foundation on which we ve built nearly 150 years of consumer trust. Any changes we make to our food must be implemented thoughtfully and carefully.""","F&B"

WHO linked red and processed meats to cancer last year, which riled up members of the meat industry. But a more recent analysis of WHO's findings shows that the organization may not have had sufficient data to make such a claim.

While plant-based protein consumption is rising across the board, certain sources stand out. The number of global food launches containing pea protein jumped by more than 80% between 2013 and 2015, according to Mintel s Global New Products Database. Pea protein is also featured in Ripple milk, which could be disruptive to the dairy industry as plant-based dairy alternatives continue to grow.

However, meat consumption does continue to rise, increasing by nearly 5% in the U.S. in 2015, the largest increase in 40 years, according to Rabobank Food & Agribusiness Research and Advisory group. Driving consumption could be, in addition to the rise in protein interest, more research that questions the health concerns surrounding meat.

The presence of bacteria in food and beverage isn't necessarily a negative for manufacturers, especially as more consumers embrace probiotics and better-for-you gut bacteria. ""Healthy"" bacteria is likely one of the driving factors of raw milk's popularity.

Another factor impacting the microbial quality of raw milk was the built environment in food processing plants. The exact nature of that impact remains unpredictable. But the safety of food production environments has become an even bigger focus for manufacturers and food safety regulators in the wake of FSMA regulations going into effect next month.

Previous studies have suggested the same, but they were generally small and limited. This is the largest study to date of its kind, which lends credence to the suggestion that manufacturers might consider avoiding certain ingredients that are common allergens, including in children's products.

While manufacturers already know of the eight major allergens, the study population recorded proportionately higher  instances of allergies to peanut, milk, shellfish and soy. Wheat allergy was more rare. That doesn't seem to fit with the narrative surrounding a rise in cases of gluten intolerance and celiac disease, which has driven the gluten-free diet trend in recent years.

This kind of research can cause parents to avoid foods with certain allergens to reduce the risk of their children developing asthma and allergic rhinitis. Sugar has been a major focus for parents, but allergens are another, especially if researchers continue to tie food allergies to other ailments in children.","F&B"

This was a major undertaking, with the Ishida's project team having to empty the pack house and re-install the three existing lines together with new steelwork and conveyors and the new line. To maximise space and efficiency, the team introduced a workable product flow with all product entering the area from one end and leaving it packed at the other.

Three weighing and bagging lines are grouped in a line at the far end of the pack house, while a conveyor takes product packed into punnets from Ishida's multihead weigher to the packing area where all packs are boxed and placed onto pallets.

To keep disruption to a minimum, nine days were originally allowed for the pack house's transformation, utilising the quieter periods over two weekends. However, the Ishida team was able to complete the task in just five days with production able to start up early.

Zenith's managing director Franco Barone said: ""This is typical of the support I have received from Ishida over the years.

""It is one of the reasons why I will only deal with Ishida when it comes to the weighing side of our operation.""

The latest Ishida salad weigher to be installed is a 14 head 5l salad specification model, which features Ishida's recently-developed easy-motion material, which helps keep salad leaves moving through the weigher. All of the company's weighers are easy to set up, and changeovers between product or pack sizes can be carried out at the touch of a button on the machines' remote control units.

Zenith also implements rigorous hygiene standards and the ease of cleaning of the weighers helps to minimise the downtime for this operation.

With Zenith operating up to 14 hours a day seven days a week, the reliability of the weighers is another important factor.

Franco says: ""I can be pretty certain that the Ishidas will not let me down.

""This is very important as we would certainly struggle if one line was out of commission for any length of time.""

One of the most impressive factors in Zenith's success is that the company's expansion has been entirely self-funded. Not surprisingly, this means that every investment in new equipment is very carefully considered.

Franco adds: ""There is no point buying the cheapest machine if its lack of reliability means it is not working for half the time.

""Service support and back-up in the event of a problem are also essential.

""And the quality of the equipment and the high levels of service are the reasons why we continue to partner with Ishida.""","F&B"

Launched in collaboration between the University of Adelaide and Agilent Technologies, the new Adelaide Glycomics research laboratory will explore the potential benefits of glycans.

The new research centre is located at the university s Waite campus and will be the first of its kind in the Southern Hemisphere. It will also feature cutting edge research technologies in the field of glycoscience.

""We need to understand the structure and biological properties; with this facility, we will be able to do that. 

Adelaide Glycomics director Vincent Bulone said:  We want to turn this into the centre of gravity for carbohydrate analysis in the southern hemisphere and we already have a lot of international collaboration from industry to do a lot of applied research with high potential in a whole range of sectors and industries.

 Carbohydrates are the most abundant molecules on earth but almost the most complex and heterogeneous.

 We cannot control very easily the properties of the application products we develop and to do this, we need to understand the structure and biological properties; with this facility, we will be able to do that. 

Adelaide Glycomics will serve as a hub for national and international collaboration in the field of complex carbohydrates across multiple industries. Carbohydrates are a type of nutrient, which is the most important source of energy in the human body.

Bulone added:  You can use carbohydrates as a metric and modify them with biomolecules that can be used as sensors. You can use them to couple as protein receptors for sensing pollutants that bind to proteins in polluted water. 

The research centre will explore new texturing agents for food, creating bioplastics, and new drug delivery systems. It will also focus on controlling the composition and quality of wines, producing hair gels and cosmetics, as well as developing biosensors.","F&B"

The investment will also include use of automatic guided vehicles (AGVs), which will move the finished product off the line and stack away into flow-through pallet racking, increasing efficiency.

The cool room expansion will enhance the storage capacity of butters and spreads once they come off the production line. It will also help the company to meet the growing demand for its dairy products.

""The cool room expansion will give us plenty of room to keep up with demand. 

Fonterra Australia regional operations manager West Andrew Nooy said:  Western Star is going from strength to strength, winning a bigger slice of the butter and spreads market as consumers shift back to eating more natural foods and incorporating it into their cooking.

 One pack of Western Star Butter is sold every minute in Australia, and the cool room expansion will give us plenty of room to keep up with demand. 

 AGVs and flow-through pallet racking are already in use in our state-of-the-art Beverages Plant, and are highly efficient, as they reduce handling of the finished product.

 Importantly, introducing the same technology to the spreads cool room will improve the safety of the site for our people by segregating pedestrians and forklifts, reducing the risk of a collision.

 With Cobden now Fonterra s largest Australian site, employing over 300 people, it s critical that we keep our people safe. 

The expansion works are expected to be completed within seven months. Last year, Western Star sales reached approximately $150m and is expected to grow further.

The extension will be effective from 30 August. The previous five-year duties expired last year.

The decision to extend the anti-subsidy duties follows after Chinese officials launched an investigation to check whether stopping the duties would impact the domestic industry.

""In May, the US challenged China s anti-dumping and countervailing duties for non-compliance with the World Trade Organisation rules.""

The investigation reports suggested that the local poultry industry would face a setback if the government lifts the anti-subsidy duties on chicken products imported from the US.

A statement published on the official website of Chinese MOC said that the anti-subsidy duties on the imports will be set at approximately 4%.

In 2010, the government imposed the anti-dumping duties on chicken products imported from the US.

In May, the US challenged China s anti-dumping and countervailing duties for non-compliance with the World Trade Organisation rules.

The duties act as high taxes on US poultry exports to China, and was challenged on behalf of American poultry producers and the hundreds of thousands of people employed in the industry.

However, the Chinese officials claimed that the chickens were subsidised in the US and then exported to the Chinese market at below market prices.","F&B"

"Emmi partners with Ardagh on microwaveable fondue bowl","Ardagh Group has partnered with a group of Dutch students on a microwaveable fondue packaging concept for Emmi.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/emmi-partners-with-ardagh-group-on-microwaveable-fondue-bowl/","Wed, 14 Oct 2015 15:43:00 +0000","Dairy","Emmi partners with Ardagh on microwaveable fondue bowlWhat began as a collaborative project between Ardagh Group and a talented group of students at the University of Twente in the Netherlands has now been adopted by a leading international food manufacturer, after dairy producer Emmi launched a unique microwaveable fondue bowl.

Ardagh originally challenged the students on the packaging design course to create  a futuristic ready-to-heat premium metal packaging concept for food and seafood. One of their designs was a cheese fondue bowl, which was presented to Emmi. In close cooporation with DeDutch, a food packaging and engineering consultant, Ardagh further developed the concept to meet Emmi s requirements.

The product has since been launched at high-end supermarkets in the US, Canada and the Netherlands.

Ardagh Group chief commercial officer, metal Woep M ller said:  We developed this exclusive microwaveable shaped bowl at our R&D centre in Crosmieres, France, with our innovative prototyping and design techniques and utilising our extensive knowledge and experience in lacquering and printing performance.

 Together with Emmi and the Fraunhofer Institute in Germany, we tested special food safe lacquers to allow the bowl to be heated either in a microwave or a traditional oven, and to be kept at the right temperature above a candle at the table. We added our patented printed Easy Peel aluminium opening solution that gives the consumer an easy and quicker means of opening the bowl. 

The business case for Emmi was clear. Marcel Zbinden, global category head speciality cheese, added:  Convenience and quick preparation have become a more important trend. This concept has it all, and it will delight fondue lovers worldwide. The All In One Fond , with a metal bowl and ready-to-eat cheese fondue made of real Swiss cheeses, has simplified the preparation of this popular dish and is a perfect combination for a quick, easy and delicious cheese fondue at any time.

Anthony Biles, founder and creative director of Biles Inc, said:  Warner Edwards gin is uncompromisingly good.

The firm wanted to capture on the bottle the craft and passion that goes into the production of each gin.

The unique label shape gives stature and distinction to the brand marque, while the story of the union of Warner Edwards  founders is reflected in the presence of the English lion and Welsh dragon on pack.

The Cold Press No. 1 fully complies with the latest European legislation for hygiene (EHEDG) and safety (CE). With cold pressing technology, both the nutrients and flavour of fresh fruit and vegetables will remain best preserved in the final juice. The Cold Press No.1 squeezes fruit more gently than other juicing methods. Fruit and vegetable juice is extracted without crushing the cells too much or creating undesirable heat, meaning that the machine works with nature rather than working against it.

The equipment is capable of pressing up to 100 litres of juice every hour, is hydraulic manuel operated, constructed from stainless steel materials and designed according to EHEDG and CE guidelines. With optional separate grinder and pump and filler available, the machine comes with three filter bags and one bucket included.

And the shelf life of cold pressed juices can be extended from a few days to a few weeks without the need for heating or high pressure processing, by utilising the PurePulse PEF technology.

All of the new machinery taps into the emerging trend for healthy, natural and delicious cold-pressed juices, Zwolle-based Foodlife said.","F&B"

Glasgow-based R-Biopharm Rh ne has introduced a robust new smart analyser called Rida Cube Scan which, when used in conjunction with enzymatic tests, detects organic acids, sugars and sulphite in wine, which are indicators of a wine s quality.

The test kit portfolio is being marketed to the drinks safety sector at a time when the UK has retained its place as the sixth biggest wine consumer in the world, and amid an anticipating increase in wine consumption worldwide.

R-Biopharm Rh ne product specialist Joanna Wilkie said:  The Rida Cube Scan is a walk-away instrument that allows automated single-testing. The first tests available for use on this system have been specifically developed with the wine industry in mind.

 All data specific for the test are stored on the RFID card, so there is no need to enter any instrument or application settings. Results are calculated automatically, displayed on the screen and can be exported to a personal computer or a laboratory information management system. 

Wilkie added that one of the great attractions of the Rida Cube Scan is its size: though small enough to sit in a desktop, its innovative technology makes precise testing possible and it contains the functionalities of larger laboratory systems.

The plan is to make the system relevant to other food-related industries, such as cereals and feed, carbonated drinks, honey, milk, dairy and fruit juice production.","F&B"

With key players such as FoodPanda leading the revolution, India has experienced a huge surge of start-ups bursting to get a piece of the market. Investors are seeing the worth in this boom and are investing heavily in food-tech start-ups, particularly those in the food delivery sector. Earlier this year, a young food delivery start up, Yumist, received $1m from Orios Venture Partners, whilst another, Bueno, received $600k from an undisclosed angel investor.

Despite this boom, we ve decided to explore some of the start-ups trying to do something a little bit different. We ve identified four young start-ups that have identified their own gap in the market and are working hard to build a successful company in India s ever-evolving food and beverage sector.

Based in Bangalore, this start up began whilst its founder, Shubra Acharya, was at university. Her artisan chocolate company allows the customer to customise their own bars, from chocolate type, flavours and toppings   essentially allowing them to play  chocolatier . Gaining a strong following from B2B clients, including those from India s top IT firms and large car showrooms, the start-up has experienced strong growth since launching in 2014. Whilst already achieving a strong presence throughout India, Happiness Bars  next plan is to gain an international audience throughout the B2B sector.

The concept for Dropkaffe came when its founders decided that the standard of office coffee was poor. The four founders came up with a plan to bring great-tasting, freshly brewed coffee to busy office workers, offering them quality, affordability and accessibility. Already live in five locations across Bangalore, the team s plan is to set up six more centres in the area by the end of the year and progress into developing cold beverages. Fulfilling around 300 orders a day, DropKaffe s growth rate means the team is expecting to reach 1,000 orders a day in the next couple of months. Another major focus for the team is packaging. Believing India still lags behind when it comes to packaging, they are working on addressing solutions for issues such as, spillage and insulation.

Inspired by the health and fitness craze in the US, two young sisters started up Yoga Bars in order to bring the  healthy  snack bar craze to India. Seeing a gap in the market for a quality, natural snack, they launched their company in August 2014. Unlike its competitors, Yoga Bars differentiates itself by being 100% natural, without the addition of corn starch, additives or added vitamins. The company is already experiencing a great amount of success and through a mixture of offline stockists and online selling, since starting, its product sales have risen from 2,000 to 20,000!

Unlike its competitors, Quinto is a food app, designed by a team in Maharashtra, which has been developed to suit the evolved restaurant diner. Rather than just helping diners discover new restaurants, Quinto uses a system of crowdsourcing to create a personalised food recommendation engine which helps its users discover the best food options. Each dish has a star rating, and the users are able to make an informed decision on the restaurant or meal based on the rating and feedback. Whilst the app is currently in beta testing mode, the team have high hopes for success since receiving an undisclosed amount of funding from the founder of the restaurant chain Faaso s earlier this year.","F&B"

Simply take a photo, and upload it for free here: www.lunarmissionone.com/ footsteps.

The Swedish company has been selling products labelled skyr in Finland for some time, marketing them as  the Icelandic super yogurt . According to the Reykjav k newspaper Morgunbla i , this has frustrated the Icelandic dairy MS Iceland Dairies, which claims exclusive rights to skyr   claiming  skyr  was not a product type but a specific trademark.

Arla was given one week to remove any skyr products from shelves, as Finnish courts ruled that skyr is a trademark owned by MS. According to the court all dairy products sold as skyr in Finland have to be produced by MS, according to an MS recipe. But the product does not have to be manufactured in Iceland.

Before the lawsuit, MS Iceland Dairies produced an advertisement poking fun at Arla s Skyr. In the video, a tub of Arla Skyr is seen struggling to understand Icelandic and mispronouncing the word skyr, while MS Iceland Dairies  product is heard calling it  yogurt posing as skyr .

Despite MS having registered skyr as a trademark in Norway and Finland, it is simply the name of a traditional Icelandic dairy product, similar to yogurt but made with whey. Skyr existed for hundreds of years before MS began marketing it and is manufactured and marketed by other dairies in Iceland. Nor is skyr a registered trademark anywhere other than Finland and Norway   a fact Arla has exploited, capitalising on the success of the popular Icelandic treat and selling it as  Icelandic super yogurt  in Belgium, Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.","F&B"
"Fruit d Or launches Pro Cran, the first cranberry-probiotic bar","Fruit d'Or has collaborated with Sunny Crunch Foods to produce the industry's first cranberry-probiotic nutrition bar, Pro Cran.","http://www.foodbev.com/news/fruit-dor-launches-pro-cran-the-first-cranberry-probiotic-bar/","Tue, 13 Oct 2015 14:24:27 +0000","Food","Fruit d Or launches Pro Cran, the first cranberry-probiotic barIn an attempt to showcase the benefits   and product versatility   of Cran Naturelle cranberry seed powder, Fruit d Or has collaborated with Sunny Crunch Foods to produce the industry s first cranberry-probiotic nutrition bar, Pro Cran.

The bar features Cran Naturelle blended with protein, prebiotics and probiotics for digestive health and overall well-being,  which literally raises the bar for cranberry beyond UTI,  said Stephen Lukawski, director of global sales and development for Fruit d Or.

The Pro Cran probiotic bar was developed as a prototype to showcase the benefits of using Fruit d Or s cranberry seed powder in the food industry. Bars remain a top choice for healthy foods on the go.

The cranberry seed contains a potent oil that is cold-pressed; the  leftover  seed meal is then dried and milled under a proprietary process to maintain the integrity of the cranberry seed with no degradation, Lukawski explained.  After conducting a finger print analysis we were able to determine that the cranberry seed is rich in fibre and contains at least 20% protein. What makes the tasty Pro Cran bar novel is that the prebiotic in the bar is derived from the cranberry seed and the probiotic is a strain called Bacillus coagulans; the cranberry seed powder and Bacillus coagulans is currently marketed as an ingredient called Lacto Cran. 

Lukawski reports that in a probiotic study by Sabinsa Corp. (East Windsor, NJ and Payson, UT) Cran Naturelle cranberry seed powder   developed exclusively for food and beverage applications   was compared against FOS (fructooligosaccharides) and inulin. Test results demonstrated that the cranberry seed generated  200% more activity growth for the BC strain over FOS or inulin.

 The cranberry seed acts as a nutritious food for the probiotic strain. It s most likely that the cranberry seed provides a carbon and nitrogen source that fuels the growth of the strain. In addition the cranberry seed contains other important attributes such as 16 essential amino acids, fatty acids and at least 2% PAC content. 

Lukawski notes that he used the Bacillus strain from Sabinsa because of its ability to ensure the cultures survive the baking temperatures needed to produce the Pro Cran bar.  As a result the cultures remain stable and active through to the last bite. 

Each Pro Cran bar delivers 2 billion CFU probiotic cultures, contains 4g of cranberry seed powder and 12 grams of protein. Enjoying two bars daily provides a good source of fibre and protein. The Pro Cran bar is coated in vanilla yogurt and is low in calories and sugar.

Pro Cran was conceived and developed by Lukawski, who has a lengthy list of unique nutra-foods to his credit, including:  antioxidant-rich pretzels, pizza flour and bread; omega 3, 6, 9 pretzels, cranberry protein pretzels, grape skin pretzels and bread, chia fibre pretzels and bread, cranberry protein and fiber bread, cranberry pizza flour, chia seed pizza flour, probiotic/vitamin C/cranberry gum for oral health, PS and cranberry cognitive health bar, and more.

 The philosophy of Pro Cran is very simple:  people prefer foods to pills in order to obtain nutraceutical benefits,  Lukawski comments.  Foods that are tasty, convenient, portable and that provide the specific sought-after health benefits will have sustained high sales velocity.

	Global packaging machinery demand is projected to advance nearly 7% annually through 2019 to almost $53 billion.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89074-world-packaging-machinery-demand-to-rise-7-annually-through-2019","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","World packaging machinery demand to rise 7% annually through 2019Global packaging machinery demand is projected to advance nearly 7% per annum through 2019 to almost $53 billion, according to a recent study by The Freedonia Group (freedoniagroup.com). Product sales will be driven by market growth in China and other industrializing nations, where demand for processed food and beverage products and other manufactured goods is forecast to post the strongest increases as personal incomes and consumer spending continue to rise. This will result in additional investment in new manufacturing capacity and related packaging machinery in the Asia/Pacific region, the Africa/Mideast region, Eastern Europe, and Central and South America. China alone will account for one-fourth of all new product demand gains through 2019. Larger producers in developing countries will raise their use of packaging materials and adopt new packaging technologies to address spoilage and contamination issues, extend the shelf lives of their products, and make them more aesthetically appealing.

Many smaller firms in these areas are expected to transition from manual packaging processes to mechanized packaging in order to expand output and increase efficiency, further boosting packaging machinery demand. Finally, a large proportion of the outdated and lower-end packaging machinery currently in use in developing countries will be replaced as production levels climb. The large, mature North American and West European packaging machinery markets are forecast to expand roughly 5% per annum during the 2014- 2019 period. Product sales in the US and Germany, the two largest markets in these regions, are expected to moderate after advancing rapidly through 2014. In Japan, the world's third largest national market behind China and the US, demand for packaging equipment will rebound through 2019 after declining during the previous five-year period, largely due to a 2014 drop in product sales from post-recession market peaks hit in 2012 and 2013. Manufacturing activity in North America, Western Europe, and Japan is projected to increase and drive fixed investment spending gains going forward.

The large food and beverage markets are forecast to account for 55% of all new product demand generated between 2014 and 2019. Multiple trends are forecast to fuel growth in these markets. As discretionary incomes in developing regions rise, households will spend more on processed food and beverage products. To satisfy this growing demand, manufacturers around the world will build new production facilities and purchase new packaging machinery. Food and beverage suppliers are also expected to introduce a wide range of new products, which often require additional packaging equipment, because of changing consumer preferences. In recent years, for example, health foods have become much more popular in North America and Europe, while sales of foods and beverages that can be consumed on the go have increased in developing nations around the world as urbanization levels have climbed. Finally, food and beverage suppliers will acquire more expensive machinery and adopt new packaging technologies because they reduce spoilage and the risk of contamination, increase the shelf lives of their products, and add to their aesthetic appeal. The steady shift toward use of higher-end equipment is expected to contribute to value gains.","Packaging"

	DuPont Packaging Award judges discuss global trends in second of six-part video. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89069-e-commerce-environmental-impact-and-profitability-weigh-on-packaging-industry","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","E-commerce, environmental impact and profitability weigh on packaging industryE-commerce, environmental impact and maintaining profitability are but a few of the challenges facing the packaging industry, according to top industry practitioners gathered in Wilmington this spring to judge the 28th DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation.

Commenting on the increasing pressure and the need to juggle a wide array of demands, the commonality of concerns reported from markets worldwide was striking. While assessing nearly 200 entries and selecting this year s top innovators, the judges answered a series of questions on packaging trends, all captured in a six-part video series. The second video in the series, in which judges were asked to name the biggest challenges facing the packaging industry, was released today.

 I think we re at a tipping point   the intersection of e-commerce and sustainability,  says Marianne Rosner Klimchuk, associate chairperson, Fashion Institute of Technology.  I saw a lot of this in the submissions   this moment in time is that pivotal point in which sustainability and e-commerce are coming together [with] people looking to reduce use of materials and thinking about innovation in terms of e-commerce. 

Finding sustainable solutions economically is a concern felt around the globe and throughout the supply chain. Brian Rivers, engineering fellow of Strategic Sourcing at Sealed Air Corporation, said:  The biggest challenge in today s packaging industry is to bring new innovative products to the marketplace while still targeting sustainability goals and profitability goals for both the consumer and the packaging company. 

Sanjay Ghoshal, senior director and global head of Packaging at India s Dr. Reddy's Laboratories, agrees.  Today the biggest challenge facing the packaging industry is the environmental impact it creates and the design that it can have to lessen the burden on the environment. 

Speed to market and driving growth are deepening challenges.  We re also asked to get to the market faster, so instead of a 12- to 18-month R&D cycle for development, we re asked to do it in say, nine to 12 months,  says Amazon senior manager of supply chain packaging Suzanne Fisher.  That s very challenging   making sure that you re   trying new things but failing fast, learning from it and then going on with a good package. 

Jeff Schuetz, Sonoco s staff vice president of Global Technology Consumer Packaging, adds,  Speaking for the markets I m familiar with  trying to figure out how we can effectively and efficiently help them grow through packaging innovation is an ongoing challenge. 

The need for more consumer education and benefits also were top of mind. Lead judge David Luttenberger, CPP, global packaging director for the Mintel Group, says,  Helping consumers understand the importance of packaging [is a challenge], whether it s in food, drink, medicine or just giving them economical access to the products that they need every day   to make their lives easier, more convenient, safer and make them feel more confident not only about the products they buy, but the role packaging plays in helping ensure that those products maintain their freshness, their quality and their efficacy. 

PepsiCo Brazil s R&D Packaging Manager Eduardo Yugue cited the need to propose:  a new consumer experience [of] food packaging, new opportunities, new consumption occasions. This is what we are looking for in Brazil, not only to protect the product but also provide other benefits to the consumer. 

 Today s biggest challenge facing the packaging industry is the number of challenges the industry has,  comments Mars global petcare packaging sustainability director Colin Yates.  We re faced with legislation, we re faced with NGOs and sustainability, we re faced with cost pressures it s the number of different things that we have to try and juggle. 

The DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation is the industry s longest running, global, independently judged celebration of innovation and collaboration throughout the value chain and is recognized globally as the leading packaging awards program. The international competition honors innovations in packaging design, materials, technology and processes.

The independent panel of packaging experts from across the globe evaluated nearly 200 entries from more than 25 countries, selecting a total of 22 winners. In the first of a six-part series of video interviews, the judges discussed the latest trends in packaging design.

The DuPont Awards for Packaging Innovation s Diamond Award recognizes one entry which truly excels in all three categories: technological advancement, responsible packaging and enhanced user experience. The newly inaugurated Diamond Finalist award, given to six companies, acknowledges the growing number of packaging innovations that excel in all three categories. As a result of ground-breaking, cutting-edge excellence in the packaging marketplace, judges awarded a new Leadership in Innovation Award. The judges awarded five gold winners and nine silver winners based on  excellence  in one or two categories.

"Always improving the packaging line"," 
	Robotics and automation have long proved their value on packaging lines for all markets. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89071-always-improving-the-packaging-line","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Always improving the packaging lineRobotics and automation have long proved their value on packaging lines for all markets. The latest and greatest prove even more valuable, addressing key customer needs while increasing productivity.

To offer packagers a variety of mounting positons and an extended reach, Comau (comau.com) introduces Rebel-S, its own 4-axis SCARA robot, in five different models with a payload of 6kg and three different reaches.

What sets these new robots apart  is that they offer a variety of mounting positions, and they utilize spacers to extend the robot s reach. Rebel-S is available with reaches of 450-, 600- and 750mm. All three versions can be floor or wall mounted, while the versions with 600- and 750mm reach can also be configured for ceiling mounting. This flexibility in mounting position is enabled by the use of dual cabling options (either vertical or horizontal). With an extension kit composed of spacers and cables, the five models are effectively interchangeable.

All models are controlled by the R1C 19  rack-mounted controller, which can be integrated into a single cabinet to control an entire line. The robots are also available in the openROBOTICS version, where the robot is directly integrated into the existing machine/line automation controlled by B&R technologies.

Collaborative robots are a growing subsection of robotics. Safety and efficiency drive this trend as more companies are adopting robots into their packaging lines.

In response, ABB (abb.com) expands its collaborative portfolio with the introduction of SafeMove2, the latest generation of its safety-certified robot monitoring software. SafeMove2 delivers flexibility, space savings and cutting edge commissioning tools for greater productivity at a lower total investment cost.

Like the original SafeMove, first introduced in 2008, SafeMove2 includes a host of safety functions, including safe speed limits, safe standstill monitoring, safe axis ranges and position and orientation supervision. The new generation functionality encourages the development of innovative robot applications by integrating safety features directly into the robot controller. It allows robots and operators to work closely together without possible harm, by restricting the robot s motion to only what is required for a specific task.

 To be efficient, robots must be able to move at speeds suited to the given application. At high speeds this can present a potential hazard for people working in the immediate vicinity. Historically, fences or cages have been used to separate man from machine in an effort to keep them out of harm s way,  says Dr. Hui Zhang, head of product management, ABB Robotics.

With SafeMove2, true collaboration is possible. For example, if an operator needs to interact with the robot system, safety sensors can be incorporated into the robot cell to detect the person s presence. After detected, SafeMove will either supervise the robot s speed or monitor it while it is standing still. Once the person clears the zone, the robot can resume operation, resulting in less down time and increased productivity.

And while not everyone is specifically requesting a collaborative robot now, the demand is steadily growing as needs change in production plants.

 To date, we have not received many requests for this technology. Typically manufacturers who are coming to us are looking for complete automation solutions   where the packaging machine replaces multiple repetitive tasks. So therefore, one machine can be more cost-effective than several robots  Collaborative robots can offer ultimate flexibility and that is a priority for many of our customers ,  says Bryan Sinicrope, VP of sales and marketing, A-B-C Packaging Machine Corp.

Designed for use in the growing flexible packaging market, A-B-C s (abcpackaging.com) new Model 600 robotic packer is an extension of the company s line of pick and place packers.

The Model 600 offers maximum flexibility to run multiple package styles with a variety of infeed options, making this machine a good choice for packagers looking to upgrade from hand packing or moving from another package style. It is equipped with a high payload 2-axis robotic arm that can be programmed for virtually any packing configuration. The operator station offers complete control in a clear and concise interface, including setup, operation, real-time and historical status reports, maintenance alerts and fault detection for troubleshooting.

Changeover can be completed in less than 10 minutes by new product/pack selection at the operator station, and quick-change tooling reduces downtime for adjustments.

Reduced downtime and simple operation are key components to a successful robotics solution. New software for palletizing and case packing addresses these needs and more. Schneider Packaging Equipment Co. (schneiderpackaging.com) offers proprietary software to ensure efficient pack patterns for customer palletizing and case packing needs. The pattern generating setup software, introduced for Robox machines, automates layouts in palletizing. The standard manufacturer s software is designed to be open-ended to accommodate multiple uses in the field. This new software can be tailored to fit the specific needs of customers, and new products can be set up in less than five minutes with quick adjustments being made to accommodate existing patterns for special unit loads. What s more is that operation is simple and guided through the human-machine interface so nearly anyone on the floor can operate the software.

The Robox is a flexible end-of-line palletizer, designed to efficiently pack pallets of various product types. It features new improvements such as the over/under conveyor, which reduces the risk of injury by allowing the operator to stand safely outside of the cell and load a new pallet into the bottom of the conveyor. Once finished packing, the full pallet is lifted and conveyed out of the cell while the new pallet is received automatically. The robot never needs to stop operation.

Today s robotics and automation technology offer customers even more benefits than they knew they needed. From space-savings to reduced downtime and collaboration, today s machines and software have answered the call for superior production.","Packaging"
"Demand for cups & lids to reach $10.6 billion"," 
	Demand for cups and lids in the U.S. is projected to expand 3.9% per year to $10.6 billion in 2020. &nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89068-demand-for-cups-lids-to-reach-106-billion","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Demand for cups & lids to reach $10.6 billion

 Demand for cups and lids in the U.S. is projected to expand 3.9% per year to $10.6 billion in 2020. Gains will be supported by food trends that favor convenience and smaller portions. Unit demand will be helped by the growing focus on specialty beverages among foodservice operators and the expansion of food menus to include soup, oatmeal, and other sides. Preference for premium coffee and fruit beverages will bolster value gains as these drinks typically use more expensive cups and lids to accommodate whipped toppings or showcase the beverage s color. These and other trends are presented in Cups & Lids, a new study from The Freedonia Group (freedoniagroup.com), a Cleveland-based industry research firm.

Packaging cups will post the fastest gains through 2020, primarily due to the fact that products packaged in cups typically are smaller portions, positioned specifically to appeal to the time-conscious consumer. According to analyst Katie Wieser,  As it becomes more common to snack throughout the day rather than prepare meals, healthy foods that are pre-packaged and portable will continue to gain favor. 

Packaging products in this way can also drive revenues for food manufacturers, as it allows items to be sold at a premium. Fresh fruits and vegetables have seen some of the largest gains attributable to this trend. Cups used for coffee and tea will see the fastest growth of any major packaging market, and cups for dairy products will continue to show favorable increases due to the popularity of premium yogurt.

Drinking cups made of paper, plastic or foam hold the largest share of this market. Gains for drinking cups will be slightly smaller than the cup and lid average due to the maturity of many applications. However, demand for hot beverage cups will see healthy gains, driven by the popularity of premium coffee and the use of high-value insulated paper cups. The mix of raw materials has changed considerably over the past decade, primarily for environmental reasons, as a number of foodservice chains have transitioned away from polystyrene foam and some cities have introduced bans on the sale or use of this foam. The largest beneficiary of these changes has been the paper cup, which is expected to show the fastest gains through 2020 and will continue to hold the largest share of the drinking cup market. There has also been wider use of clear plastic cups, which allow for greater visibility of the beverage.","Packaging"

The luxurious, deep red Amaranth shade answers customer demand for eye-catching, on-trend tops to go on wine and spirit bottles, and is also relevant across a range of other hot stamping applications.

Luxury and premium goods manufacturers are ensuring that their packaging, by acting as a  second skin , effectively conveys both the product s qualities and their brand values. Deep, luxurious colors that interact with the latest print technologies and add a highly tactile finish, such as the Amaranth shade from API, are a big part of how premium packaging solutions are becoming truly relevant to their brands.

 Customers were asking for a richly romantic red to link with the latest color trends, so we developed and launched the graceful, nostalgic Amaranth shade to provide the high-impact results their packaging demanded,  explains Bob Almer, VP of sales at API.  Our PG Foils add real depth of color and opacity when applied. 

The PG range is a premium grade matt pigment hot stamping foil, and the number one choice for general purpose applications. It excels at both fine detail and the kind of broad area coverage required by the packaging sector, and is especially relevant for the beauty, cosmetics and drinks industries, among other consumer product applications.

Hot stamping foils from API ensure the best, most reflective finish of all coating processes, and are also the most versatile for use on different materials and substrates. The heat and pressure used to stamp the pigment foil simultaneously flatten the contours of the substrate, providing a smooth surface printing area and allowing clean, high quality text and graphics to be achieved on uneven, rough and textured surfaces.



  Our PG hot stamping foil is ideal for application, as it lends that extra wow-factor that inks can lack,  adds Almer.  We're delighted with the final result of the Amaranth color and are confident that its premium deep metallic finish will provide that magic boost to help convince customers to buy the product.

The challenge was to find an ultra-bright white carton board that could stand up to the process of applying complex finishes, and Algro Design fit the bill perfectly.

 

 Michel Lassalle, head of the luxury market department of Artigrafiche, the Italian leader in packaging for the wine and spirits market, was a key partner for the House of Besserat de Bellefon in choosing the carton board. He says,  Algro Design is set apart by its peerless white surface, and it does not tear even if it is subjected to very deep and multiple embossing operations. It offers a luxury look and feel and is ideal for complex finishing processes. 

 Finding the right solution

Lassalle explains that the graphic design for the packaging required a pure white background with a metallic effect, adding,  Since we were using embossing and hot foil, we needed the very best materials to cope with the stress of these finishing processes. Algro Design from Sappi ticked all the boxes. By printing with a matt varnish, we managed to create a natural finish. The extreme smoothness of the Algro Design material also works well with cold foil, which in turn enabled us to use bespoke metallic colours. In addition, the board remains exceedingly stable on the press, which makes it the perfect solution for packaging high-end luxury products like Cuv e des Moines. 

The Besserat de Bellefon approach to sourcing ensures that only the very best parcels of grapes from the best Champagne vineyards are used. That philosophy also extends to the packaging decisions for Cuv e des Moines and other brands within its portfolio. Marine Gantet, brand manager at Besserat de Bellefon, comments,  From the winemaker to the export director, all of the teams share the same philosophy which is based on tradition and sophistication harnessed together to ensure the excellence of our Champagnes. In order to present our bottles in the best light, we needed a presentation case that was up to the standard of its contents. From a graphic design perspective, the key objective was elegance and purity, and we achieved that with the Algro Design solution. 



Lasalle remarks,  The market looks for brands to enhance luxury packaging. This has led to an increasing use of gold foil, cold and hot silver foils and other metallised films in the finishing process. I am delighted with the results achieved for the Besserat de Bellefon packaging. The packaging really enhances these iconic products. 

Gantet sums up by saying,  Sappi is an invaluable partner. With this exceptional packaging for the House s line of Champagnes, I can only hope that our consumers enjoy experiencing the presentation case as much as they enjoy discovering the Besserat de Bellefon sensation when they taste the wine. 

Since its launch almost a decade ago, Algro Design has been one of the most popular SBB carton board products for the production of high quality premium packaging. A large number of demanding brand owners and packaging converters have recognised that it is the ideal material for high quality and prestige packaging. Algro Design (front side   double coated, reverse side - uncoated) and Algro Design Duo (symmetrically double coated on front & reverse side) both demonstrate brilliantly how Sappi has been able to channel all of its science and expertise into the art of producing cellulose premium solid bleached carton board.

"Intralogistics: a cornerstone of the global economy"," 
	Dr. Beumer reveals trends and challenges in intralogistics. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89060-intralogistics-a-cornerstone-of-the-global-economy","Thu, 25 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Intralogistics: a cornerstone of the global economyDr. Beumer, what can you tell us about trends that are currently important in intralogistics?

Dr. Beumer: Intralogistics is a cornerstone of the global economy. For companies it is no longer a necessary evil; it is crucial for gaining a competitive edge and creating added value. Moreover, it opens the way to new business models, such as e-commerce and customization of products and services. We ve all discovered how convenient it is to order goods via the Internet. Online shops are open all the time, and customers can shop anywhere and at any time from a computer, tablet or smartphone. If they don t like what they ve bought, they just send it back.

What new challenges has this created for intralogistics?

Dr. Beumer: The demand for reliable, flexible delivery is steadily growing. In online retailing same-day delivery has almost become standard, especially with groceries. Customers expect to get what they ordered right away, whether it s frozen pizza, strawberry ice cream or lettuce. This trend is accompanied by an atomization of orders. Businesses and private individuals have no notion of the effort involved when they order a product and then a second one a few minutes later and expect the two to be combined in a single delivery   oh yes, and when the package comes to the house, please ring only once. The increasing flow of goods in e-commerce, along with the problem of handling returns, has led to greater connectivity, automation and system integration. For me, these are the key areas that are providing solutions.

Could you explain that in more detail?

Dr. Beumer: Supply chains nowadays are organized and interconnected from end to end   from the source of raw materials to the consumer s door and continuing on to returns, disposal and recycling. The driving forces are the expectations of consumers and industrial customers. For consumers, what counts is the benefit they expect from products and services. Products and services must be tailored to their individual interests and needs. For industrial customers, whose main concern is high productivity, efficient production processes are paramount. Here reliable, cost-effective logistics is indispensable. But the new emphasis on individuality has set the bar so high for logistics that stackers and high-bay warehouses by themselves are no longer sufficient. Technical solutions at the starting points and connection points, in other words value-added services, are becoming increasingly important, plus software control.

How important is flexibility in supply chains?

Dr. Beumer: It is critical. Globalization is bringing about lasting changes in markets and the economy. The economy is becoming more international, but also more regional. On the one hand, customers in Europe configure their laptops on the web and have them assembled in Texas, while their summer clothes are sewn in Vietnam. And they want to receive these products at the front door within 48 hours. On the other hand, they want to buy locally grown organic food. The same is true for businesses. They order products on the global market, but they still want to have their specialized suppliers in the vicinity. All companies, large and small, must adjust to these new patterns of procurement, production and sales. This is leading to far-reaching changes in the supply chain and it will require enormous flexibility. Without efficient intralogistics none of this will be possible.

The theme of CeMAT 2016 was  Smart Supply Chain Solutions . What does this mean?

Dr. Beumer: The theme was a very good choice. It calls attention to the fact that future processes in logistics will be automated and interconnected. Increasing digitization will bring about fundamental changes in value chains, and entirely new business models will emerge. The adoption of digital technology and the associated changes in people s thinking will create new challenges not only for logistics companies, but also for service providers of all kinds. For them, success in the future will depend even more on the capabilities of their logistics centers. Intralogistics and digitization are inseparably linked. Industry 4.0 is already a reality, as is the internet of things, which in many areas has become part of everyday life. The opportunities are enormous because we re talking about highly scalable systems. Intelligent solutions are already available, but the possibilities of this technology are by no means exhausted. For example, increasing numbers of logistics companies and warehouse operators are opting for autonomous in-house transport systems that select their own routes, and for warehouses that detect empty stocks in real time and fill them.

Companies have been using driverless transport systems for some time now. Do you see a trend here?

Dr. Beumer: Yes, a clear one. The trend is away from heavy, inflexible handling equipment to small, multifunctional vehicles. The latter are much more versatile when it comes to in-house transport and warehouse operations. The vehicles independently agree on which of them should do which job and what routes to take. I see a direct correlation here with the growing trend towards small load carriers and goods packed in cartons. These are being used more and more as a result of e-commerce and atomization. In addition, lean concepts are becoming more important in assembly, in combination with smaller inventories and order quantities. Intralogistics is undergoing a radical transformation.

What must be done to cope with these changes?

Dr. Beumer: We must plan processes with the future in mind and devise safe and reliable technical systems. This will mean more and more processors, user controls, software and control units. All of these elements must be integrated into a harmonious, ergonomic, efficient and user-friendly system that is able to handle the gigantic quantities of data. The complexity of logistics makes IT indispensable; it is the only means of intelligently controlling the flow of goods. We will need smart solutions for the supply chain. The performance of IT systems and components will have to be continuously improved. This applies to more than storage and distribution; it extends to areas such as manufacturing and the supplying of assembly workstations, and it also includes the consumer. In all parts of the supply chain value creation and profitability will thus increase. There will also be benefits for mechanical and systems engineering. In many companies software already accounts for half of the new solutions being developed, or even more.

What does this mean for you as a manufacturer of equipment and systems for intralogistics?

Dr. Beumer: Nowadays, unless we decide to alter machinery and equipment, we can often only achieve increases in performance and efficiency by creating better software. This opens up an exciting area of activity for us, one with great benefits for our customers. We have grown from being a component supplier to become a system integrator. We equip our systems with intelligent software and control units from the very start. This is a big advantage for users. Their processes are more flexible, and they are efficient even with a batch size of one. With a comprehensive database our customers can optimize their processes from start to finish and achieve significant savings thanks to greater transparency.

What did CeMAT hold in store for visitors?

Dr. Beumer: CeMAT presented solutions for all of these trends and highlighted areas of potential. The focus of the exhibition, logistics IT, was important owing its relevance to all areas of logistics. Software has a bearing on all areas and connects them. CeMAT therefore was a must not only for IT experts, but also for logistics specialists, production managers and business managers throughout the world. They had an opportunity to survey the entire market and discover what will be in the production facilities and logistics factories of tomorrow.","Packaging"
"Metal packaging market forecast to reach $128 million by 2021"," 
	After a significant slowdown in the late 2000s, the global market for metal packaging has recovered its growth with the highest rates registered in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89059-metal-packaging-market-forecast-to-reach-128-million-by-2021","Thu, 25 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Metal packaging market forecast to reach $128 million by 2021After a significant slowdown in the late 2000s, the global market for metal packaging has recovered its growth with the highest rates registered in Asia, Eastern Europe, the Middle East and Africa.

In its new report, The Future of Metal Packaging and Coatings to 2021, Smithers Pira (smitherspira.com) estimates the market will grow by around 3% in 2016 to reach $106 million, driven mainly by increasing demand for metal packaging in emerging and transitional economies at a time when demand in more mature markets is likely remain flat. Going forward, the global market metal packaging is forecast to grow at an annual average rate of 4% to reach $128 million by 2021.

In terms of global trade, many developing countries such as China, India and Brazil have long been associated with significant manufacture and international exports, providing goods for the world, but not consuming them domestically. This is no longer the case.

 Whilst bulk metal packaging and export-related packaging has slumped slightly in emerging markets, growing social mobility coupled with an expanding middle class, China is seeing private consumption grow by more than 20% year-on-year as disposable incomes, especially in urban areas, are rocketing,  states Dan Rogers, head of publishing at Smithers Pira.

 As a result, many of the economic powerhouses have begun increasing domestic consumption, creating major growth opportunities for local businesses. Nuances of consumer taste in these regions, such as the Indian preference for food cans over rigid plastic packaging, and Brazil s unique traditional beverages have introduced an exciting new growth opportunity that relies more on local brands and domestic trade than mass imported and exported delicacies. 

A major development in metal packaging market is smaller volume, higher value craft beers and ales. This emergence from the beverage can market represents a wider shift in otherwise highly saturated regions such as France or Germany. Smaller breweries and soft drink providers cannot sell the significant bulk that larger companies can, and instead opt to use the relatively cheap 330ml and 500ml beverage cans as a canvas for complicated 360o designs, holographic logos and bespoke packaging designed to appeal to a niche consumer. Digital printing technology has allowed can manufacturers to produce these smaller quantities without significantly increasing the per-can cost. Larger companies have begun embracing this shift into bespoke products in the FMCG market with more variance of design on cans, limited edition cans to commemorate specific events, and targeted marketing campaigns that aim to make the most of this new freedom within the beverage can market.

Consumers are more aware than ever about environmental issues, and there has been a strong trend towards reusing metal packaging such as beverage cans and aerosols, especially in Europe. The European Commission has imposed challenging targets for recycling, and landfill sites have seen increased taxes. European recycling has increased its metal packaging recycling rate steadily in recent years, and in 2013 reached around 75% recycling of rigid metal packaging, and the industry s target objective of 80% metal packaging recycling in Europe by 2020 is on track. Other regions, such as North America, are lagging behind this goal, with only around 35% recycling of metal packaging in 2013 from the US. This is still an improvement on previous years though, suggesting the trend is present, if not as dramatic. Technology strides are still being made to further lightweight rigid metal packs, continuing to reduce the amount of material used, mainly steel and aluminium.","Packaging"

The conveyor consists of a heavy-gauge stainless steel screw that rotates within an 8 in. diameter (200 mm) stainless steel tube. Since the conveyor is driven at its top end by a 20 hp (15 kW) variable speed electric motor and gear reducer, material exits the discharge housing prior to contacting any seals or bearings. The tube interior and removable screw are smooth and crevice-free, allowing rapid, thorough cleaning.

Rugged enough to withstand incidental contact with front end loaders, the heavy-gauge stainless steel hopper holds up to 8 tons (7 tonnes), or 200 cu. ft. (5.7 m3), providing an ample supply of material for the high capacity conveyor to run continually as a front end loader replenishes the material.

Self-contained on an all-stainless skid equipped with forklifting tubes, the system can be deployed in multiple indoor or outdoor locations with a single power connection, conveying a broad range of free-flowing and non-free-flowing materials from fine powders to large aggregates including abrasives, corrosives and materials with bulk densities up to 150 lb/cu ft (2400 kg/m3).



 Material is conveyed at a 40-degree incline before discharging into downstream processing equipment or storage vessels. The simple design is said to deliver efficient performance and high reliability while reducing maintenance and cost. The system is also available constructed of carbon steel with durable industrial coatings.

Other equipment manufactured by the company includes tubular cable conveyors, pneumatic conveying systems, bulk bag dischargers, bulk bag conditioners, bulk bag fillers, bag dump stations, drum/box/container dumpers, weigh batching systems and engineered plant-wide bulk handling systems with automated controls.","Packaging"

Consumer interest is growing in electronic hygiene devices. By being automated, many of these products benefit from perceived superior efficacy credentials in comparison to traditional counterparts, as consumers seek out the best way to achieve their hygiene goals.

""New technologies designed to target consumers' hygiene rituals can help to drive interest and excitement around brands and the wider hygiene category by providing unique and disruptive approaches, particularly as devices have mainly been associated with the beauty space,"" analyst Jamie Mills explains.

The boom in smartphones has also led to greater interest in more intelligent and integrated solutions, which can monitor and better manage specific facets surrounding personal hygiene, and well-being more generally.

Mills adds, ""This segment is currently in its infancy within the hygiene space, as evidenced by Canadean's research. Looking at oral care alone, only 12% of global consumers say they are currently using digital tools such as smartphone apps and wearable devices to monitor or manage their oral hygiene. Nevertheless, a significant opportunity exists to engage consumers using these technologies, with 40% saying that they would use them in future, particularly among tech-savvy millennials.""

Canadean believes the desire for more proactive, diagnostic, and personalized management of health and hygiene creates important opportunities for players in the hygiene space to pioneer new smartphone-compatible tools, companion apps, and even partnerships with technology brands. One such example of this approach is Oral B's recently launched GENIUS toothbrush, which combines motion sensor technology in the brush with video recognition in the user's smartphone camera via a companion app.","Packaging"

"Using intelligent mobile technology to streamline packaging specification management"," 
	The packaging specification market is expected to grow to around $1 trillion by 2020, according to the research firm, Smithers Pira, making up around 200-plus million packaging SKUs around the world.&nbsp; ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89051-using-intelligent-mobile-technology-to-streamline-packaging-specification-management","Thu, 18 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Using intelligent mobile technology to streamline packaging specification managementThe packaging specification market is expected to grow to around $1 trillion by 2020, according to the research firm, Smithers Pira (smitherspira.com), making up around 200-plus million packaging SKUs around the world. With 60 million in the U.S. alone this number is growing daily, as is the complicated process of sharing specs and managing them, both internally and externally. This growing complexity impacts the entire value chain.

Today, there is no common method, technology solution or platform for handling packaging specifications and they typically end up being managed through disparate systems and solutions, such as emails, spreadsheets, binders and ERP systems. ERP & PLM systems are not built for SKU and specification management and specification repositories, generally PDF-based, are not comprehensive enough or allow intelligent data analysis.

Because of the lack of standard systems, it is a sad reality that companies typically manage the symptoms of problems and accepts them as the normal course of business and acceptable  institutional  costs. They add people, layer on processes, create task forces, restructure and insert software not designed for a specific purpose hoping that it can be modified to address the business needs and produce results.

The challenge with traditional technology and organizational solutions is that they mask the real problems. Tremendous time is spent, costs go up and the problems don t go away   as soon as any variable changes, the problems reappear. Companies spend many millions of dollars to cover these additional institutional costs and still rarely solve the problem; it hasn t been easy.

Simply, finding and addressing the real root cause of problems has been difficult; there are so many things out of your control and the complexities in the supply chain are increasing even further. Whether it is problems with suppliers and raw materials that create huge production costs, production downtime due to bad or missing parts/products, logistics problems on all ends, groups that cannot communicate or even the fear of changing suppliers since it creates an entirely new set of potential pitfalls   companies find it too difficult to get to the root cause.

All it takes is one bad spec to lead to a failure, which can lead to product recalls and potential devastating damage to the brand. Packaging specifications can ultimately impact product lead-time, as well as all activities across the internal and external value chain (marketing, sales, purchasing, logistics) and ultimately, impact the delivery to the customer.

Many companies today are still managing their packaging specifications in traditional software systems that are not specifically designed to manage specs, and the result is a proliferation of SKU s, higher costs, greater business risk and inefficiencies throughout the value chain   which ultimately is driving costs higher and higher for every stakeholder. And, the answer is not to simply continue to demand price reductions from suppliers. Solving the root cause and ultimately decreasing costs across the entire value chain requires a new way of approaching specifications to ensure their accuracy.

Compounding the complexities already found within the value chain is consumers  ever-increasing need for transparency and demanding to know, not only what is in their products, but also where they came from and who made them. Today s disparate systems make it difficult or nearly impossible to implement traceability across a value chain. A simple review of the enormous number of FDA recalls due to not identifying allergens shows how difficult it is to maintain accurate specs from multiple suppliers and convey those specs accurately and timely on a product packaging label so consumers are aware of ingredients in their food.

Accurate specs enable the value chain to function faster and effectively, while inaccurate specifications impact logistics, transportation, speed to market, responsiveness to recall/failure and the very foundations or business, etc.

Solving the complexities of packaging specifications across value chains can produce enormous savings for all stakeholders. Achieving those savings requires cooperation among stakeholders and an easy-to-use, simple solution that enables the sharing of specification DNA, both internally and externally, across the entire value chain. With today s mobile and cloud-based technology, the field of specification management is poised to take advantage of these latest advances in technology. Intelligent, cloud-based solutions that allow anywhere/any device access greatly enhance companies  ability to deploy their specs anywhere, anytime to employees and suppliers around the world.

Furthermore, the DNA of billions of specifications creates an enormous amount of big data. With 200 million specifications, each with 30 attributes equates to six billion data points that can be analyzed. Big data analysis provides the ability to identify cost-saving trends and opportunities that are otherwise hidden in a myriad of unconnected, disparate systems. Opportunities, such as raw material indexing, new product development, green idea development, analyzing currency impacts on raw material, transportation optimization, capacity expansion and more.

Today, specifications are impacting all value chains and the impact is more negative than positive. With systems designed and built specifically for spec management, specifications will have a positive effect for every stakeholder across the value chain, no matter what the product.

specright is a specification management company with a vision to leverage specification expertise and cloud technology to improve the way specifications are shared, analyzed and audited. The company's mission is to empower customer efficiencies by providing Intelligent Specification Management Platforms that are available anytime, anywhere from any device.

"Retail ready packaging offers advantages over traditional packaging"," 
	Demand for retail ready packaging is forecast to increase 5.2% annually to $6.2 billion in 2020, outpacing the overall packaging market average. ","http://www.packagingstrategies.com/articles/89048-retail-ready-packaging-offers-advantages-over-traditional-packaging","Wed, 17 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Retail ready packaging offers advantages over traditional packagingDemand for retail ready packaging is forecast to increase 5.2% annually to $6.2 billion in 2020, outpacing the overall packaging market average. Retail ready packaging (RRP), also known as shelf ready packaging, display ready packaging, and pallet ready packaging, refers to secondary packaging for retail products that arrives in a manner enabling items to go directly onto the shelf or selling floor without the need for unpacking of inner contents.

RRP offers a number of advantages over traditional retail packaging in terms of labor costs, stock handling, and product visibility. Gains will be supported by further growth of mass retailers and club stores, and increased food and beverage sales volume in nontraditional outlets such as drug and dollar stores. Additionally, the proliferation of club stores and no-frills deep discount grocery stores will be especially important for RRP, as such stores primarily sell merchandise directly from secondary packaging and require their vendors to ship products in RRP, according to The Freedonia Group's (freedoniagroup.com) new study, Retail Ready Packaging.

Among major RRP product types, corrugated boxes, which represent more than 50 percent of total demand, will provide the strongest opportunities. According to analyst Esther Palevsky, ""Growth will be supported by expansion in the retail user base and the increased presence of value-added box types."" Gains for retail ready corrugated floor displays, folding cartons and reusable plastic containers (RPCs) will be more moderate than those for boxes, but will still be helped by overall retail trends promoting greater use of RRP.

Food is the predominant market for RRP, accounting for almost three-fourths of demand in 2015. Through 2020, growth in food uses will be fueled by labor cost savings resulting from reduction of product handling requirements during stocking. In addition, disruptive trends in the U.S. food retailing landscape will bode well for RRP. Among such trends is the increasing competition that traditional supermarkets face from a host of alternatives, including club stores, deep discounters, mass retailers, drug stores, farmers' markets, and e-commerce vendors. Increased openings of smaller-format locations by mass retailers will also promote gains for RRP, as these stores carry a more limited product selection than their traditional counterparts and have fewer employees. These stores can benefit from RRP's ability to speed stocking of shelves and increase shelf space efficiency.","Packaging"

 According to Excelsior Wines, U.S. importer for Frontera and parent company Concha y Toro, Chile s best-selling wine brand hopes to appeal to a new generation of wine lovers   21-34 year olds   with Frontera After Dark.

Starting this fall, consumers will notice striking changes to Frontera s 750-ml. range, including the addition of an  After Dark  tagline, a nod to the younger generation, for whom  The day starts to come alive at night!  Frontera Night Harvest Blends are a fresh winemaking concept: grapes harvested in the cool of the night for bolder flavors and aromas.

 

 Labels for Frontera After Dark 750-ml. bottles   the favored format of millennial wine lovers -- will now sport a dramatic black background, overlaid by a depiction of the Andes Mountains, traced in pale gold, making Frontera one of the first  dark-label  entries in the $4-7 value-wine sector. Dark labels represent a powerful new trend in the U.S. marketplace and dominate the landscape where millennials are concerned, as registered by an impressive +29% volume increase over traditional cream/white labels in 2015.

 

 Joining Frontera s After Dark 750-ml. line-up are two new blends: Moonlight White and After Midnight Red. Moonlight White is a semi-sweet style, faintly effervescent, fresh, light Moscato-based blend. After Midnight Red is a Cabernet Sauvignon-Syrah blend, rounded out with a touch of Merlot.

 

 Frontera After Dark 750-ml. white varietals, including the new Moonlight White as well as the Pinot Noir will be sealed with a twist-off closure. Frontera  After Dark  750-ml. reds, including After Midnight Red, will remain under cork. Each Frontera After Dark label will retail for approx. $6.

 

 Support for Frontera After Dark will be provided via a 360 marketing campaign. At the  pre-tail  level, this includes geo-targeted social media ads and partnerships with the Ibotta in-store shopping app and online delivery services such as Drizly. Retail promotions include in-store radio ads, floor talkers and high-value discount bottle neckers, logoed wine racks, case cards, case sleeves and cold-box trays. A digital ad campaign, targeted at social media influencers and featuring wine cocktails and sangria recipes is also underway.

Frontera s classic 1.5-liter varietal range is also poised for a makeover, albeit of a more subtle nature. Launched in the U.S. in the early 1980s, Frontera s 1.5-liter format was an instant hit with baby boomers and today enjoys a multi-generational appeal. Starting in this summer, labels for Frontera s 1.5-liter wines will feature an enhanced image of the Andes Mountains juxtaposed against a cream background, to evoke a heightened sense of place and origin. A  ticket-stub  addition, with the varietal name positioned above a  Vineyards Protected by Nature  tagline, conveys a sense of journey, while referencing Chile s pristine natural environment, which offers exceptional conditions in which to nurture fine quality wines.","Packaging"

"Easy-to-use DNA Tests May Shed New Light on Food Fraud","DNA bar-coding that quickly confirms or reject claims that a food product is what it purports to be are entering the market, with the promise of exposing economically motivated fraud.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/dna-tests-food-fraud/","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 11:35:00 -0400","NA","Easy-to-use DNA Tests May Shed New Light on Food FraudEconomically motivated fraud and adulteration of food and beverage products goes back millennia.

The Roman philosopher and writer Pliny the Elder actually complained about premium wines blended with inferior grapes in the first century A.D. Today, misrepresentation is almost enshrined in practice: Napa Valley cabernet sauvignon only has to have 75 percent Napa cabernet grapes; the balance can be 15 percent reds from other California locales and 10 percent cheaper Napa varietals.

Whether it s shark sold as swordfish or olive oil cut with sunflower oil, the victim is the end consumer. Retailers, restaurants and food companies play the role of intermediaries in the supply chain, and if they paid for grouper but got catfish, well, most likely some schmuck pays the retail price for grouper.

In typically tortured fashion, the FDA contorted itself in the rule-making process for the Food Safety Modernization Act, drawing a distinction between food fraud that poses a health threat and fraud driven by economic gain. The former is subject to preventive controls; the latter is relegated to food defense and does not require preventive steps.

The Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) standards don t slice the bologna so thinly, lumping both under the straightforward need for enterprise risk management. To be certified under GFSI standards like BRC and SQF, companies need to have fraud prevention programs in place.

There s no shortage of tools to stop fraud in its tracks. Gas chromatography, mass spectrometry and whole genome sequencing are among the available technologies, although the cost and time needed to get a positive ID make them prohibitive. The need is for simple, inexpensive and easily administered tests to confirm raw materials and ingredients are what they are purported to be.

Fortunately, DNA profiling is delivering more affordable tools and gaining commercial traction. Species-specific molecular probes that draw a sample for a polymerase chain-reaction (PCR) test in a lab can deliver a confirmation or rejection in a few hours. The concept is similar to home pregnancy test kits, with the added enhancement of a PCR machine that some food companies already have on site for pathogen detection tests.

Two professors at the University of Guelph in Ontario founded Tru-ID Ltd. three years ago to develop such probes. Botanist Steven Newmaster and geneticist Robert Hanner also are involved in the Biodiversity Institute of Ontario & Centre for Biodiversity Genomics, which is developing a DNA Reference Sequencing Library. To date, DNA bar codes for 10,000 fish species have been developed.

The biodiversity library already covers many species of no commercial value. Food companies don t need a card to that library: They simply want a red light/green light answer to whether or not they are taking delivery of the fish they ordered. They can get that answer quickly and easily with PCR analysis that compares DNA extracted from the sample with a colorimetric bar code of the nucleotides of the real deal.

Tru-ID s species-specific probes are being commercialized in Instant Labs, a Baltimore maker of small PCR machines that can be used by a technician with minimal training. Probes for Chesapeake Bay blue crab and several species of salmon are being distributed through Instant Labs, which also offers Elisa test kits for food pathogens.

Mainstream food companies have been slow to embrace DNA bar-coding, but Tru-ID recently scored a success in the herbal supplement sector. Nature s Way markets Devil s Claw, an anti-inflammatory that often is adulterated. New York attorney general Eric Schneiderman secured cease-and-desist orders last year against more than a dozen marketers of Devil s Claw marketers for using ""a cheaper related species that is considered less desirable."" Nature s Way was exempted because it was able to verify and certify the purity of its supplement, based on DNA bar code testing.

 Organized crime is increasingly seeing food fraud as an attractive activity because the penalties are low,  Hanner observes. Yet when Guelph scientists started flagging widespread seafood fraud,  we were labeled food terrorists  intent on painting an overly bleak picture of the problem. But instead of relying on fraud prosecutions and shifting instead to authentication programs,  We ll clean up the bad actors more quickly and efficiently,  he believes.

The embrace of DNA barcoding and other rapid-identification technologies may come sooner than most realize. Hanner foresees  citizen scientists  buying probes and getting results from a lab, then blowing the whistle on brand owners who inadvertently sell surimi labeled as cod.

 You re going to get tried in the court of Facebook and Twitter if your product is exposed as fraudulent,  Hanner warns.","F&B"

The company indicated it would be difficult to strike a deal before next year because of shifting dynamics at its controlling shareholder, the Hershey Trust Co., according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.

""As the world's leading snacking company, we remain focused on successfully executing our strategy to deliver both sustainable top-line growth and significant margin expansion and are well-positioned to continue to deliver value to our shareholders,"" said Mondelez chairman and CEO Irene Rosenfeld. ""Our proposal to acquire Hershey reflected our conviction that combining our two iconic American companies would create an industry leader with global scale in snacking and confectionery and a strong portfolio of complementary brands. Following additional discussions, and taking into account recent shareholder developments at Hershey, we determined that there is no actionable path forward toward an agreement. While we are disappointed in this outcome, we remain disciplined in our approach to creating value, including through acquisitions, and confident that our advantaged platform positions us well for top-tier performance over the long term,"" Rosenfeld said.

Mondelez initially approached the takeover bid with Hershey in June, offering the Hershey, Pa., chocolate company $107 a share in a transaction valued at more than $25 billion, including the assumption of debt. After receiving input from the company management and outside financial and legal advisers, Hershey s board of directors unanimously rejected the expressions of interest, determining that it ""provided no basis for further discussion between Mondelez and the company.""

The deal was largely hinged on the Hershey Trust, which controls 80 percent of the company s stock and which has opposed selling the company in the past.

Moving forward, the maker of Oreo cookies and Ritz crackers said it will continue to execute its plans to deliver sustainable growth and shareholder value. Analysts say this likely reinforces the notion that Hershey is unattainable as an acquisition target in light of its majority ownership by a trust that for years has been reluctant to sell.","F&B"
"What You Need to Know About the GMO Label Law","It's a practical compromise solution that hopefully will put this issue to bed; but it does have special requirements.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/acheson-gmo-label-law/","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 10:45:00 -0400","NA","What You Need to Know About the GMO Label LawYou probably know by now that in July the House concurred with Senate bill 764 and President Obama signed the legislation requiring the development of a national standard for GMO labeling   pre-empting and barring any state regulations for such labeling.

But, do you know exactly what the new regulation means to you and consumers? Following is a summary of the key points of the rule.

The Basics: The term ""bioengineering"" (and any similar term) refers to a food that contains genetic material that has been modified through in vitro recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) techniques, for which the modification could not otherwise be obtained through conventional breeding or be found in nature. A food derived from an animal cannot be considered a bioengineered food just because the animal consumed feed produced from, containing or consisting of a bioengineered substance. The rule does not apply to food served in a restaurant or similar foodservice establishment.

With the passage of the rule, no state or political subdivision of a state may establish or continue any requirement for the labeling or disclosure of whether a food or seed is bioengineered or was developed or produced using bioengineering that is not identical to the mandatory disclosure requirement. So this effectively closes down the new regulations in Vermont and any other states that may be planning to do the same thing.

The Timeframe: Within two years of enactment, USDA is to create a national mandatory bioengineered food labeling program, considering consistency with that of the Organic Foods Production Act. It also is to establish a process for requesting and granting a determination regarding other factors and conditions under which a food is considered a bioengineered food.

The Requirements: In general, the bill requires food manufacturers to disclose the presence of bioengineered foods on product packaging. Specifically, it requires:

A food may not be considered to be   not bioengineered,     non-GMO,   or any other similar claim describing the absence of bioengineering in the food solely because the food is not required to bear a disclosure. However, certification of a food under the national organic program shall be considered sufficient to make a claim regarding the absence of bioengineering in the food   which makes sense since  organic food  is not allowed to contain GMOs.

As with all such rules, recordkeeping will be required to be made available to inspectors on request; however the specifics of the records are to be determined as the specifics of the standards are developed.

USDA is also to conduct a study, within a year after enactment, to determine any potential technological challenges consumers may face in accessing an electronic or digital disclosure. If it is determined that shoppers will not have sufficient access, then additional, comparable options for access are to be provided.

Interestingly, the rule specifically states that ""the Secretary shall have no authority to recall any food on the basis of whether the food bears a disclosure that the food is bioengineered."" This fits with the idea that bioengineered food does not represent any type of public health threat.

While some stakeholders have criticized the rule, calling it anti-consumer and a denial of consumers' right to know, others applaud it as a ""bipartisan agreement that supports science, which has shown that GMOs are safe,"" and as a way of preventing a ""patchwork of state laws.""

From my perspective, this is probably about the best outcome one could have hoped for. Food companies are not going to have to deal with individual state requirements, which, if allowed to move forward, would have had an impact on both the cost of food as well as the availability of food on a state-by-state basis.

The fact that this program is going to track with the USDA organic program is a strong signal that GMO food does not present any type of public health threat. If FDA were not clear about the safety of GMO food, that agency would want control of the GMO issue.

While this bill may not have given consumer organizations all they want, it is a practical mid-line solution that hopefully will put this issue to bed permanently and allow food companies to focus on real public health issues.

","http://www.foodprocessing.com/blogs/thescoop/hojos-last-stand/","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 13:08:00 -0400","NA","HoJo's Last StandAdd another fond and memorable item to the Obsolete List, along with the likes of cassette tapes, phone books and the Rolodex: One of the last two Howard Johnson restaurants in the country will close in a couple of weeks (early September).This pretty much marks the end of Hojo fried clam strips, ice cream and other menu staples that fed baby boomers, leaving a once-iconic king of roadside restaurant chains slipping into the brink of extinction.

This special piece of roadside Americana will no longer be located in Bangor, Me., after Sept. 6. The closing in Bangor will leave only one Howard Johnson restaurant, and that's in Lake George, N.Y. Ah, the end of an era.

Before falling on hard times, Howard Johnson took restaurant franchises to a new platueau. The orange-roofed eateries once numbered more than 800, with the New England-based restaurant chain predating Howard Johnson hotels. The business dates back to 1925 when Howard Deering Johnson inherited a soda fountain in Quincy, Mass. Johnson began producing 28 flavors of rich, creamy ice cream with a quality and taste that never varied. This brought a steady stream of loyal customers to the store, which was later expanded to serve grilled hot dogs and fried clams. That evolved into a chain of restaurants featuring the ice cream and various kinds of comfort food. The orange roof with a blue spire represented a dependable place for travelers to park the family car, grab a meal and spend the night.

Johnson established the franchising concept, a fairly new business idea, but he reasoned that if he let a franchisee use the now recognizable Howard Johnson name, and they purchased all food and supplies from him through a central supply commissary, he could charge a fee in exchange of the use of his brand. The roadside restaurants began to be franchised throughout New England in the late 1940s and early 1950s and spread West, numbering in the thousands.

The good news is that the Lake George restaurant appears to be on solid ground and is open year 'round.

"Power Lunch: Processors Can Develop a Digital Presence that Drives Results","Online consumers shop through third-party sites, making it harder for brands to stand out among competition.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/processors-digital-presence/","Thu, 25 Aug 2016 15:18:00 -0400","NA","Power Lunch: Processors Can Develop a Digital Presence that Drives ResultsTo drive sales, food manufacturers and brands need to create brand value by accessing and influencing customers directly. In today s highly digital world, the best way to interact with consumers is to reach them where they are already engaged -- online.

However, developing a digital presence to interact directly with shoppers is much easier said than done for brands. For the most part, consumers shop online for groceries through retailers or third-party sites such as Instacart, as opposed to purchasing from the brands themselves. This makes it essential for brands to stand out among competition when advertising on retail and other third-party sites, while also developing their own unique digital presence.

Here is a closer look at how food brands can achieve success through the digital medium.

Shape your brand: For food companies, it s important to remember Marketing 101: differentiate your brand. Some of the most successful food brands are achieving this by focusing on popular trends like organic, paleo, locally sourced or natural. Craft beer companies, for example, are establishing cult followings by emphasizing their local, niche qualities.

But to do this effectively, especially considering their digital-savvy target audiences, brands must shape their reputation through the digital medium. There is often a lack of shelf space available in-store to truly develop these personas. Brands need to create digital properties that define who they are by offering rich content such as blog posts, videos and recipes. This will adjust consumer s perspective of the marketplace. Consumers, millennials in particular, often choose their preferred brands based on non-traditional marketing, such as corporate initiatives, as opposed to solely convenience or pricing.

A great example of this is HelloFresh, a food delivery company that brands itself as a provider of fresh, healthy ingredients and offers interactive content on its site to build this persona. HelloFresh.com establishes a deep connection with its customers, while also building trust, by providing thought leadership posts that explain where their meats and produce are sourced from.

Formulating a digital engagement strategy is becoming increasingly important as shoppers spend more of their time online. Millennials and Gen Z are reaching an age of significant buying power. They want to develop a relationship with the brands producing their food and turn to the Internet to do so. At a high level, they are seeking an ongoing relationship as opposed to a transactional one. Brands can build and nurture this relationship by engaging with consumers through digital channels, which is further proof that having a digital presence is essential.

Use other digital tactics: What s important for brands to realize is that consumers are not always interacting with food & beverage brands through the brand s owned social and digital channels -- they are also browsing retail sites, conducting Google searches and being influenced by targeted display ads on their favorite sites. Brands need to control their message across all touchpoints with a highly customized digital marketing strategy.

In other words, it s crucial for brands to reach consumers where they are already engaged and at the point of purchase. In addition, these interactions need to be relevant and targeted based on known consumer demographics and shopping intent. The following tactics must be included in any food and beverage brand s digital marketing toolbox if they want to be successful:

Ultimately, the changing landscape of grocery is unavoidable and brands must adapt to remain competitive. Consumers in the digital age shop with their phones in hand and conduct more online research before purchasing now than ever before. For brands to maximize revenue (particularly new brands without name recognition) they must develop a strong digital presence -- from an owned website to targeted search and display efforts.

Greg Stevens is EVP-Media, Sales and Insights at MyWebGrocer (www.MyWebGrocer.com). He's an industry veteran with 17 years of interactive media experience, and earlier was president of Liberty Advertising.

"AHA Recommends Sugar Limits for Kids","The American Heart Association issued  a statement recommending that children consume less added sugar each day.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/industrynews/2016/aha-advises-sugar-limits-for-kids/","Thu, 25 Aug 2016 11:29:00 -0400","NA","AHA Recommends Sugar Limits for KidsKids in the U.S. got some sour news on Aug. 22 from a major health organization issuing new guidelines to curb children's consumption of sugary foods and beverages. The American Heart Association (AHA) is recommending that children between the ages of two and 18 consume less than six teaspoons of added sugars each day.

Starting in July 2018, food products sold in the U.S. will have to list the amount of added sugars on the Nutrition Facts Panel.

In the first of three new recommendations from the American Heart Association (AHA), a panel of health and nutrition experts suggested that kids consume no more than 6 teaspoons (30 mL) of added sugar a day, according to the organization's statement published in the journal Circulation. It's based on a review of available scientific research on how sugar affects children's health.

That amount of sugar equals about 100 calories, or 25g (0.9 oz.) of sugar. Added sugar is considered to be any sweetener that has calories   such as table sugar, high-fructose corn syrup, honey and molasses   and is used as an ingredient in processing and preparing foods or beverages. Added sugar also includes any sugars a person adds to food or drinks at a meal.

""Our target recommendation is the same for all children between the ages of 2 and 18, to keep it simple for parents and public health advocates,"" said lead author Dr. Miriam Vos in a heart association news release. ""For most children, eating no more than six teaspoons of added sugars a day is a healthy and achievable target,"" explained Vos, a nutrition scientist and associate professor of pediatrics at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta. ""There is little room in a child's diet for added sugars, because they need calories from vegetables, fruits, protein sources, whole grains and dairy to grow up healthy,"" she said.

Added sugar can, however, be used in small amounts to improve the taste of foods that are healthy and rich in nutrition   such as whole-grain cereals, flavored milk or yogurt   to make these foods more appealing for children, she added. But there are loads of added sugar in sugary drinks, cookies, cakes and candies, foods which have little to no nutrition value, Vos cautioned.

The second AHA report recommendation said children younger than 2 years should not consume foods or beverages with added sugars at all. The panels of experts suggested that introducing added sugars in the diets of infants and toddlers may encourage them to develop a preference for sweets from an early age. The third called for children and teens aged 2 to 18 to limit the amount of sugar-sweetened drinks they consume to no more than 8 oz. (240mL) a week.

The report didn't issue guidelines on the use of non-nutritive sweeteners, such as sucralose or aspartame, because it said the panel found few good-quality studies of these sweeteners' benefits or health risks in children.

Children who eat foods loaded with added sugars tend to eat fewer healthy foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy products that are good for their heart health,"" Vos noted. ""There has been a lack of clarity and consensus regarding how much added sugar is considered safe for children, so sugars remain a commonly added ingredient in foods and drinks, and overall consumption by children remains high    the typical American child consumes about triple the recommended amount of added sugars,"" she continued.

""Until then, the best way to avoid added sugars in your child's diet is to serve mostly foods that are high in nutrition, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy products, lean meat, poultry and fish, and to limit foods with little nutritional value,"" Vos said.

This is the first time the AHA has released its own set of recommendations for kids about added sugars. But previously, Vos explained, the federal government's 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommended that children get no more than 10 percent of their total calories a day from added sugar.","F&B"

"Novel Technologies Provide Options to Conventional Pasteurization, Sterilization and Drying","New and emerging technologies can take years to find a food manufacturing audience. This year s IFT Food Expo included several innovative drying and kill-step technologies at various stages of the development cycle.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/technologies-pasteurization-sterilization-drying/","Tue, 23 Aug 2016 14:43:00 -0400","NA","Novel Technologies Provide Options to Conventional Pasteurization, Sterilization and DryingMore than 200 industrial-scale high-pressure pasteurization (HPP) machines are in service in North America, most owned by food companies that primarily use them for their own products. A growing number are owned by tollers who accept packaged food and beverage products in fee-for-service arrangements. Here is a list of those firms

Heat kills, and that s fine with food processors who want to ensure the safety of raw and minimally processed foods.

Heat also degrades the quality of products, and that s a concern when the product in question s health benefits are compromised by thermal treatment. Vacuum, ultraviolet light and other techniques can limit negative impacts, but processors who want a food safety intervention that doesn t degrade taste or nutritional value have had to rely on propylene oxide and other chemical pasteurizers, all of which leave behind some residues, however minute.

Strictly speaking, a new intervention from Agri-Neo Inc. (agri-neo.com) is a chemical, although it has been certified organic by Ecocert Group, L Isle-Jourdain, France. The only residue is water, developers point out, and log reductions from 2 to 5 or more for bacteria, fungi, yeast, mold and coliform loads are delivered, depending on the dosage used.

Agri-Neo is a Toronto-based startup that began research on the technology in 2009. Beta testing was done last year with several Canadian food processors. Everspring Farms, a Seaforth, Ontario, firm that processes about 25 varieties of raw seeds, sprouted grains and other natural products, commissioned an industrial scale unit in May.

Dale Donaldson, owner of Everspring Farms, trowels sprouted grains pasteurized in a Neo-Pure machine at has Seaforth, Ont., facility. Donaldson began applying the nonthermal system to products in April. Photo: Agri-Neo

Everspring Farms is taking a measured approach, applying the compound to seeds like chia and flax that will be sold as ready-to-eat and offering it as an option to customers who will further process them, according to owner Dale Donaldson.  So far, I m happy with the system,  he says, but the processor is evaluating the results on a case-by-case basis before expanding treatment to all products. Everspring previously deployed an infrared pasteurization process, but results were inconsistent.

According to Rob Wong, Agri-Neo s president and COO, the system consists of a rotating drum in which a mist is sprayed on up to 12 tons of product per hour. About 2 percent moisture pick-up occurs during the process. A post-treatment dryer is an optional though highly recommended component.

 The water isn t bound, it s free on the surface,  Wong explains.  We want to remove it at the end so that the product is back to its natural moisture level because you want to minimize any possibility of re-growth. 

The biocide is classified as peracetic acid, although it is derived from several types of plants, with food-grade ethanol as the carrier. The solvent contributes a molecule of oxygen when it contacts a microbe, rupturing the cell wall and leaving behind water.  The combination of agents wasn t something that was obvious, and they attack microbes in a number of different ways to consistently deliver at least a 5 log reduction,  he adds.

The residual water isn t enough to cause  gumminess  in seeds like chia and flax, he says. The compound has been approved by Health Canada and the U.S. EPA. A similar peracetic-acid wash for fruits and vegetables is on the market, but Agri-Neo s compound won t bleach grains and doesn t cause a breakdown of protein in hard wheat. That s a consideration for grain millers, several of whom are considering their pasteurization options in the wake of several E. coli-related flour recalls

Agri-Neo is working with two millers considering treatment of grain before it is milled. Those firms  processes involve tempering to reduce moisture levels. The pasteurizer could be added during a hold step, avoiding the need for any additional capital equipment.

Mass heat transfer aided by acoustic waves is an option for drying and cooling food that is slowly attracting interest and installations. The Dept. of Defense is one of the technology s biggest proponents, with food scientists at the U.S. Army Natick Soldier RD&E Center in Natick, Mass., eyeing it as a way to improve the quality of shelf-stable Meals Ready to Eat (MRE).

Tom Yang, senior food technologist at Natick, spoke about the technology at IFT. He cited numerous production efficiencies and food quality improvements to acoustic drying and cooling, including faster line speeds, significant reductions in energy use and a much smaller footprint compared to conventional dryers. Yang is working with Zinovy ""Gene"" Plavnik of Heat Technologies Inc. (HTI), an Atlanta engineering firm that secured a U.S. patent last year for acoustics-aided heat transfer.

The physics of acoustic or ultrasonic drying involves the breakdown of the boundary layer that envelopes the area to be cooled or, conversely, cooked. As Plavnik explains, sound waves from ultrasonic transducers  start obstructing the boundary layer and allow heat and moisture to escape.  That accelerates the heat transfer process that occurs.","F&B"

"Cheers to Spicy Alcoholic Beverages","From spicy apple ciders to savory bonanza Bloody Marys, a popular trend in alcoholic beverages is muy caliente.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/spicy-alcoholic-beverages/","Tue, 23 Aug 2016 11:50:00 -0400","NA","Cheers to Spicy Alcoholic BeveragesDespite much merger and acquisition activity lately, the adult (alcoholic) beverage market remains strong. London-based Research and Markets expects the U.S. spirits market to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 3.51 percent from 2016 to 2020. Beer is also enjoying solid sales. Technavio s (www.technavio.com) research points to beer as the highest selling alcoholic beverage in the U.S., and says craft beer will move forward to dominate the market until 2020.

Reports also show there's strong demand for adult beverages with a bit of bite. Spirits, wines and beers are being redefined and refined in terms of flavor, and many of the new drinks incorporate hot, spicy or savory flavors along with rather unusual ingredients and aromas. Consumers, particularly those daring millennials, want creative, local, unique and specialty options. Thus, retail adult beverage sections are being stocked with innovative and convenient items that can make the most inexperienced home bartender feel like a mixologist.

The internet has opened the door to many cultures and more exotic flavor profiles, thus inspiring spicy, savory and smoky beverage flavors such as Ancho Reyes (anchoreyes.com) chili pepper liqueur. Mortal Kombat X Beer, from Washington's Sound Brewery (www.soundbrewery.com) and Global Beverage Traders is a craft brew named after the popular Warner Brothers computer game. According to the Beer Street Journal, Mortal Kombat X Beer soon will roll out three vibrant beer flavors, one of which is Scorpion Imperial Stout, which blends fiery southwest chilies and Madagascar vanilla bean.

Tart, spicy and savory options are also cropping up in tequila. Jose Cuervo's new Cinge Especial Silver (cuervo.com) is infused with fiery cinnamon, giving the smooth tequila an unexpectedly hot twist. Further evidence of the piquant theme is a cocktail bar in New York's East Village called Mace (the spice, not the spray), which offers countless spice-themed drinks from what looks like a laboratory, with rows of jarred spices.

Cocktails with a kick are described on myriad websites, such as the Cocktail Project (www.thecocktailproject.com), developed by Beam Suntory for cocktail enthusiasts, where viewers can explore libations and learn how to make them. One creation uses DeKuyper Cordials and JDK & Sons' Crave Chocolate Chili Liqueur, which has sweet chocolate and subtle caramel and vanilla notes plus the zip of chili peppers. Another is a Hot Spicy Cider, which combines cinnamon, Pinnacle Atomic Hot Vodka, hot apple cider and whipped cream. Imported by Portfield Importers, Pinnacle Atomic Hot Vodka (www.pinnaclevodka.com), has a sweet/hot cinnamon flavor, balanced with savory cloves.

Of course, Classic Bloody Marys never go out of style, and restaurants and bars across the country enhance traditional Bloody Mary mixes with a cornucopia of garnishes and inclusions, such as beef broth, herbs like rosemary, hot sauce, buffalo wing sauce and cilantro, notes the adult beverage site vinepair.com. A Cocktail Project recipe called the Devil & Miss Mary combines the recently launched Jim Beam Devil's Cut bourbon, tomato juice, four to six dashes of Worcestershire sauce, three to five dashes of Tabasco Hot Sauce, a few shakes of black pepper, basil leaves and a lemon garnish. Beam describes Devil's Cut as having a smoky flavor, with depth and complexity that comes from liquid extracted from inside the barrel wood.

More adventurous options come from the Bloody Mary cart at 1313 Main in Napa, Calif., which contains more than 20 choices for add-ons -- from fried oysters, duck pastrami and fried shrimp cocktail, to sriracha salt, kimchi brussel sprouts and candied jalapenos. ""Bloodies continue to evolve from the traditional spicy tomato juice and vodka recipes,"" notes Cheers Magazine in a list of its ""Beverage Trends for Bars and Restaurants in 2016.""

Bloody Mary enthusiasts also can try Tabasco brand Bloody Mary Mixes (www.tabasco.com) in Mildly Seasoned or Extra Spicy varieties. The non-alcoholic, tomato juice-based mixes are made with McIlhenny Co.'s famous pepper sauce, the same one used in the original Bloody Mary recipe, created at New York's St. Regis Hotel in the 1930s. The mixes can also be enjoyed straight, as a healthy morning drink or ""mocktail.""

These spicy adult quenchers are in turn driving innovation in mixers. Jalapeno and Smoke are ready-to-use syrups from London's Funkin (www.funkinusa.com), made from ground jalapenos or smoked oak wood, respectively. ""Consumers are experimenting with new and exotic ingredients such as sriracha, sambal and wasabi, while smoked cocktails are more popular alongside whisky and bourbon cocktails,"" says Andrew King, Funkin's managing director, in a recent Spirits Business article.","F&B"
"Market View: How to Counter Amazon s Entry Into Food","The online retailer s development of food brands should be a wakeup call to all food and beverage processors.","http://www.foodprocessing.com/articles/2016/market-view-amazon-entry-into-food/","Mon, 22 Aug 2016 12:05:00 -0400","NA","Market View: How to Counter Amazon s Entry Into FoodWell, the inevitable finally happened. Amazon, one of the largest retailers in the world, with one of the most respected brand names in the world, has developed its own private label food products. Not only will it include traditional center-of-the-store products but Amazon is expected to push fresh perishable foods as well. Reported say the first of these brands should appear by the end of this summer.

In developing private label products, Amazon is entering a growth market. Store brands reached $118 billion in sales last year, which was up $2.2 billion from the previous year, according to the Private Label Manufacturers Assn. So as long as traditional retailers are already taking away sales from branded companies with their own private label products, why shouldn't Amazon enter the fray? I expect them to do very, very well.

Think of the marketing strength Amazon is capable of bringing to this marketplace. It already grew its other consumer packaged goods (CPG) businesses by 42 percent in 2015, outpacing the 30 percent growth of overall e-commerce and far outpacing the growth in brick and mortar stores. Granted, we re talking about growth from a much smaller base but it s also clear consumers are moving in that direction.

Amazon was already  the great equalizer  by placing a mom-and-pop operation's homemade jellies from wild fruits and berries next to Smucker s. Now we will be able to see choices like  Happy Belly  (a potential name for an Amazon private label brand) next to the two aforementioned brands.

There are a number of steps food processors must consider if they expect to compete with Amazon s private label product. The first thing is for food processors to get back to innovation. One thing the private label industry in general has failed to do is to come out with truly innovative products. Those companies have been satisfied with the profits they ve been making by creating look-alike brands and brand extensions.

Innovation is a way to keep the legacy brands ahead of the pack. New products, new packaging, new sizes, new everything that the modern consumer wants to buy. This has always been the hallmark of the branded food business, but in our quest to get quarterly profits higher we ve taken our eye off the consumer.

A second thing is to use every available channel of communication to tell consumers why your brand is the best choice. While it s important to have shelf space and to placate retailers by giving them all sorts of financial incentives to keep your products on the shelf, we need to get consumers to take products off the shelf. Today s consumers are using a much wider variety of communication channels than ever before. I would provide a list of the various online channels of communication but by the time this article is published they are likely to be antiquated and replaced by totally new channels. When I discussed this with one food processor, he was miffed by my criticism that his company really didn t have a strong online presence. He made it quite clear to me  they did have a website. 

A third alternative, which some consider anathema, is to make private label products for Amazon. Two things are likely to be true. Neither you nor Amazon wants to produce the exact same product that is available in the bricks and mortar channel. So you can still maintain a unique product on the shelves and of course the opportunity to introduce your innovative products.

Even if those Amazon sales do not produce the same margins you get in the traditional grocery store, there should be substantial opportunities to spread the overhead across more categories. Don t forget you may make more money with a lower margin and a lot of sales than a higher margin and fewer sales.

I think one of the hardest parts of being a senior marketing manager is the recognition there needs to be a lot of change. No one I have ever met says they love to change their marketing programs or their products. Unfortunately, the world has been changing dramatically and it makes no sense to lament the fact that one of the world s largest retailers is going to start selling private label products. It also makes no sense to ignore all of the emerging channels of distribution that are developing because you have traditionally sold to supermarkets.

The mantra for food marketers must be  think a new and act anew. ","F&B"

Gen Z kids comprise 17 percent of the population, or about 55 million people who are making their own buying decisions, including food purchases. They look for clean-label information on foods, as they're significantly more likely to own cell phones, use social media and spend a lot of time online than the groups that preceded them.

Growing up during the Recession, they are more pragmatic and value-conscious than other generations   yet they also look for organic and non-GMO foods.

This group is self-aware, open-minded and very diverse, says Mintel's food and beverage analyst Sarah Theodore.

In June, it took a bigger step in collaboration by opening its Culinary and Innovation Center on the grounds of world headquarters in Bentonville, Ark.

""We love perfecting food at Walmart and are proud to be the nation s largest grocer,"" says Charles Redfield, executive vice president of food for Walmart U.S. ""Our private brands team -- the people behind Great Value, Marketside and the like -- hit a home run by making this new facility a reality. It represents the heart of what we do   advocating for our customers by creating exciting items, ensuring quality and always delivering low prices.""

The center's 12,000 square feet house 10 kitchens, including a studio-style chef s kitchen and replicas of the bakery and deli kitchens found in most of the company stores; a variety of stoves, ovens and microwaves, ""so we can cook the same ways our broad customer base cooks at home""; adult beverage testing lab and consumables testing lab; double-sided sensory testing lab that can accommodate 12 individual customer taste tests at a time; and meeting space.

""We ve had dedicated spaces for testing items [scattered throughout] our home office for years, and Sam s Club opened a sensory lab in 2010,"" said a spokesperson. ""This facility gives us more room to test and puts all of our Walmart U.S. food and consumables testing areas in one space.""

Redfield mentioned Mystery Peeps and Sam s Choice premium ice creams as past developments that were heavily directed by Walmart, although they predate the culinary center.

One just-introduced product that emerged at least in part from the Culinary and Innovation Center are Hostess Deep-Fried Twinkies. A frozen, ready-to-heat boxed product is coming to more than 4,000 Walmart stores nationwide by Aug. 16. After three months, Hostess may make them available to other retailers.

They're initially exclusive to Walmart because they were developed with Walmart. ""When I heard rumblings that Hostess was considering a deep-fried Twinkie, I was intrigued,"" said John Pearson, senior buyer-frozen foods for Walmart U.S. ""Not only was it something different for the frozen aisle, it filled a need, too, as we were looking to add more dessert choices to our mostly savory assortment.""

Pearson gave a narrative online: ""We set up a meeting with Hostess to discuss the details. Why this product could succeed. How it lines up with our philosophy of making shopping fun and exciting again. How consumer trends tell us to focus on both products that are healthy and overindulgent   those 'sometimes' foods that are so good they re worth the calories. I talked about the way this product appeals to everyone: from the Boomers who have fond memories of Twinkies as children, to millennials craving a cool midnight snack.

""The first prototypes Hostess brought to our kitchens were a far cry from the product you will see on shelves, but the potential was evident,"" he continued. ""So we continued to give feedback on taste, appearance, packaging and naming, based on tests and what we ve learned about consumers all over the business. Eventually, we got to the delicious final version now arriving in our stores. And thanks to Walmart, Hostess is growing by entering the frozen food aisle for the first time ever.""

Vanilla or chocolate versions of the cream-filled snack are battered and partially fried before being frozen. They need to be finished in an oven, toaster oven or frying pan before being consumed. They're the result of a yearlong collaboration between Hostess and Walmart. Deep Fried Twinkies reportedly have 9g of fat and 220 calories, compared to 4g of fat and 130 calories in a regular Twinkie.

Reports last week note that a motion put forth by General Mills to dismiss the matter involving the marketing of Cheerios Protein has been denied in part, leaving the company open to a future lawsuit.

A decision on Aug. 10 by U.S. District Judge Thelton Henderson said consumers may pursue a claim that General Mills violated the federal Nutrition Labeling and Education Act, since it ""misbranded"" Cheerios Protein as a high-protein alternative to regular Cheerios.

Though ""skeptical"" it would succeed, Henderson refused to dismiss the plaintiffs  claim that reasonable consumers would likely be deceived by packaging for the cereal, noting that text mentioning its sugar content and being ""sweetened"" appeared in small print on the boxes.

General Mills said it does not discuss pending litigation.

Plaintiffs said the real difference between regular Cheerios and Cheerios Protein was negligible because the serving size of Cheerios Protein, and the calorie content per serving, was twice as big. Reports added that the plaintiffs also called the Cheerios Protein name misleading because it said nothing about the 16 or 17g of sugar in a serving, versus a single gram in regular Cheerios. The plaintiffs acknowledged Cheerios Protein has more protein than regular Cheerios (7g per serving versus 3g per serving), but they contend the amount of additional protein is not material, particularly considering the larger serving size and calories per serving of Cheerios Protein.

The lawsuit was filed by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a Washington-based nonprofit group, last November on behalf of consumers in California and New York.","F&B"

These trends have accelerated the move toward the use of plant-based proteins as meat substitutes. The majority of meat substitutes are still soy- or wheat-protein based, but products are evolving with alternative protein ingredients such as egg, pea, ancient grains and nuts.

 This trend represents a growing opportunity for high-quality meat alternatives, which is also being reflected in the 24 percent average annual growth in global meat substitute launches recorded between 2011 and 2015,  says Lu Ann Williams, director of innovation at Innova Market Insights.  A key area of opportunity in meat substitutes may be in targeting meat eaters as much as vegetarians. While many vegetarians may opt for a diet rich in vegetables and beans, meat eaters may turn to meat substitutes if the product is right. Instead of just finding alternatives, technological solutions also need to be focusing on the development of meat substitutes closely mimicking the taste and texture of meat products.

	In evaluating its forecasted growth expectations for beverage alcohol sales at the nation's bars and restaurants, Chicago-based Technomic &nbsp; expects to see modest improvements in 2016, the market research firm says. This comes from research conducted for Technomic's Adult Beverage Planning Program, a membership-based program delivering suppliers with research on key topics and trends related to the adult beverage on-premise industry. ","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89582-technomic-expects-modest-growth-for-alcohol-on-premise","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Technomic expects modest growth for alcohol on-premiseIn evaluating its forecasted growth expectations for beverage alcohol sales at the nation's bars and restaurants, Chicago-based Technomic expects to see modest improvements in 2016, the market research firm says. This comes from research conducted for Technomic's Adult Beverage Planning Program, a membership-based program delivering suppliers with research on key topics and trends related to the adult beverage on-premise industry.

Although the overall restaurant industry has been experiencing stronger momentum, slower traffic at major casual dining chains and an evolving consumer dynamic are resulting in a ""new normal"" in which consumer drink purchase patterns have changed, the market research firm found. For 2016, Technomic expects overall consumer spending on beverage alcohol in the away-from-home channel to grow at a modest 2.3 percent, with similar expectations for 2017, it says. Total alcohol volume in bars and restaurants is expected to be flat in 2016, it adds.

""It's true that the operating environment is better for many restaurants and bars, but consumer occasions that include an alcohol beverage at these establishments are not growing,"" said David Henkes, senior principal at Technomic and head of the firm's beverage practice, in a statement. ""We see a number of underlying factors, including a different consumer mindset, with many consumers drinking less, but higher quality when in a bar or restaurant. There's also growth in takeout and delivery   both areas that negatively impact the beverage occasion   as well as increased competition from new channels in both retail and foodservice for the alcohol occasion.""

In looking at specific categories of adult beverage in on-premise locations, Henkes notes that beer remains the underachiever, with expected consumer spending growth of 2 percent. ""Craft and imports are trending positively, but domestic beer, which still accounts for over half of on-premise beer volume, remains challenged,"" he said.

Spending on spirits is expected to grow at a rate of 2.8 percent, the fastest expansion of all categories due to the popularity of whiskey and craft cocktails and the ongoing premiumization trend. Spending on wine is forecasted to grow at 2 percent, Technomic says.

Henkes cautions that restaurant and bar operators must ensure that the value proposition of their beverage program is aligned with their consumers' expectations. ""We continue to stress to our clients the importance of a strong adult beverage program   it drives customer satisfaction, and is obviously a source of incremental profitability"" he said. ""But with consumers still cautious on spending, it's important to stress the quality and creativity of a beverage program.""","F&B"

Running from Sept. 1 through Oct. 31, Tecate s We ve Got Your Back program, featuring national TV spots, on- and off-premise activation, digital partnerships and a daily sweepstakes, will bring boxing fans together to celebrate leading up to the main events, it adds.

 Tecate and sports viewing go hand-in-hand, and our consumers are more than 20 percent likely to watch sports versus those of the leading domestic light brand,  said Juan Carlos Montes, shopper marketing manager for Tecate, in a statement.  Tecate is helping consumers turn their sports viewing occasions into ritualistic gatherings where fans get together to celebrate. Our powerful Black Eagle symbolism and boxing superstar, Canelo Alvarez, will team up throughout Tecate s We ve Got Your Back program to create a brotherhood our fans can become a part of and make this year s celebrations as bold as they can be. 

The program will be supported by national TV spots in English and Spanish that feature Canelo Alvarez and Tecate s Black Eagle. Tecate will keep fans engaged with a daily sweepstakes inviting consumers to enter for the chance to win the ultimate viewing package including a TV, a surround-sound system, mini refrigerators, glassware and other instant prizes. Geo-targeted desktop and mobile ads on relevant sites and owned social media channels will drive users to the sweepstakes website hub to enter, the company says.

At retail, in-store sampling (where legal) will encourage trial, while point-of-sale materials, including pole toppers, price cards, base wraps and standees, will drive shoppers to digital experiences and the daily sweepstakes. Additionally, Tecate is partnering with an on-demand delivery service to bring Tecate to shoppers  doors, it says.

Consumer sampling, branded signage, including table tents, posters and standees, and Tecate drink offers through TAB Services  in-app media will encourage purchase of Tecate and sweepstakes participation in on-premise accounts, it adds.

Montes continued:  Mexican imports drove 88 percent of the import beer segment s growth. Tecate Light is on fire, outperforming the beer category and Mexican import segment with 46 percent growth [year-to-date] (YTD). Tecate s We ve Got Your Back provides retail and on-premise operators with all of the elements they need to capitalize on this growing segment and Tecate s authority with boxing.

"Heaven Hill releases limited-edition bourbon"," 
	Heaven Hill Distillery, Bardstown, Ky., announced the 2016 limited-edition release of Parker&rsquo;s Heritage Collection: a 24-year-old, bottled-in-bond bourbon.&nbsp; ","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89580-heaven-hill-releases-limited-edition-bourbon","Mon, 29 Aug 2016 00:00:00 -0400","NA","Heaven Hill releases limited-edition bourbonBottled-in-bonds, as they are referred, have experienced renewed interest from consumers because of the long and storied history behind such a designation, the company says. Heaven Hill has launched several new bottled-in-bond bottlings, including the newest edition of Parker s Heritage Collection. The 24-year-old, bottled-in-bond will ship into select markets across the country beginning in September.

The Parker s Heritage Collection series originally was conceived to showcase the quality and broad range of Heaven Hill s American Whiskey holdings, according to the company.

The 2016 edition, the tenth in the series, features two separate versions of the bottled-in-bond product. It was produced in fall 1990 and spring 1991 at Heaven Hill s distillery in Bardstown, Ky., which was destroyed in 1996 by fire along with seven rickhouses and more than 90,000 barrels, the company says. The liquid is bottled by season in order to retain its bottled-in-bond designation. Although Heaven Hill now produces its bourbon and American whiskey out of the Bernheim Distillery in downtown Louisville, this Parker s Heritage Collection edition will feature the original distillery designation on the back label, it adds.

Bottled at 100 proof and non-chill filtered, the bourbon will retain more of the natural esters and fatty acids that have matured in the barrel for almost a quarter of a century, providing a richer mouthfeel, the company says. Oak flavor is prominent with hints of cinnamon and vanilla, rounded out by a clean finish with a hint of chocolate.

Heaven Hill Master Distiller Emeritus Parker Beam, for whom the acclaimed series is named, was diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) several years ago. The past three editions from 2013-2015, including the  Promise of Hope  Bourbon, the  Original Batch  Straight Wheat Whiskey and the Kentucky Straight Malt Whiskey, respectively, have raised more than half a million dollars toward ALS research and patient care through contributions made by Heaven Hill for each bottle purchased. Heaven Hill will continue with this cause-related campaign and will contribute $15 from the average national retail cost of $249.99 of each 750-ml bottle sold of this year s release to the ALS Association. With every past edition of Parker s Heritage Collection quickly selling out, the company expects to continue to generate significant dollars for this effort, it adds.

 We are proud to again offer a unique bourbon style for the Parker s Heritage Collection, one that is a nod to Heaven Hill s expertise with bottled-in-bond products,  said Susan Wahl, American Whiskey Group Portfolio manager at Heaven Hill Distillery, in a statement.  As the oldest bottled-in-bond bourbon in the world, we anticipate this to be another highly sought after addition to whiskey fanatics  collections and, as important to us, it will enable a significant contribution to ALS research and patient care efforts. 

Packaged in the same upscale 750-ml bottle as the previous nine editions but with a cream colored label, the Parker s Heritage Collection 24-Year-Old Bottled-in-Bond Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey bottling reflects the care and craftsmanship of its contents, the company says.","F&B"

Consumer sampling also will drive trial in on- and off-premise accounts throughout the college football program, the company says.

Katz added:  Since 2012, Mexican import is the only segment in the category that has shown consistent double digit growth year-over-year. Within the Mexican import segment, Dos Equis drinkers make 36 percent more shopping trips, and spend 30 percent more per trip than the leading Mexican import. Our college football program will allow retailers to leverage the growth of Dos Equis and the Mexican import category among fans of college football, the second most watched sport in the U.S. ","F&B"

The following are agreement highlights:

Commenting on the new agreements, CBA s Chief Executive Officer Andy Thomas said in a statement:  We are proud of our long-standing relationship with AB and have always been candid about the competitive advantage of our distribution arrangement, which allows CBA to independently manage our brands and still enjoy the benefits of being a valued part of AB s exceptional wholesaler network. As both of our companies evolved over the past 18 months, it became clear that our strategic focus and commitment to the growth of craft beer were increasingly more aligned, and we started to explore ways to collaborate more closely. We re excited to build on this partnership and look forward to the financial and operational benefits, which will positively impact our top and bottom line. 

Felipe Szpigel, president of The High End division at Anheuser-Busch, added: ""We have deep respect for CBA and these agreements represent a natural progression of our relationship with them. As a company, we believe in brewing amazing beers and elevating the sophistication of beer and the category as a whole.

We will support the growth of CBA s brands and create new opportunities for both companies through our unparalleled network of U.S. wholesaler partners, dedication to quality through our industry-leading breweries and international reach.""

CBA is expected to gain significant financial benefits from these commercial agreements that will allow the company to continue investing in its growth strategy and increase its sales and marketing spend behind its brands, the companies say. As a major CBA shareholder, AB is positioned to directly benefit from those gains, along with the expected opportunities the agreements will create for its international distribution system, U.S. wholesaler partners and breweries, they add.

CBA and AB will work together in the coming months to implement the brewing and international distribution aspects of these agreements, they say.

"Beverage market prepares for labeling changes","It s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.","http://www.bevindustry.com/articles/89511-beverage-market-prepares-for-labeling-changes","Mon, 15 Aug 2016 09:00:00 -0400","NA","Beverage market prepares for labeling changesIt s not uncommon to hear mainstream media toss around phrases like  a new era  or  the next frontier.  The frequency of their usage can sometimes fall upon deaf ears; however, members of the beverage market should not ignore these phrases when it comes to latest in food and beverage labeling laws.

In May, the Food and Drug Administration released the new Nutrition Facts label. Among the changes include bolder and larger type for calories, serving size as well as changes to nutrients required. However, the biggest impacts will be an update to the serving sizes to reflect the amount that consumers typically will consume as well as including an Added Sugar section under the Total Sugars section.

Many beverage-makers already have updated their serving sizes, but the added sugars will be a new component. Brand owners will have until July 26, 2018, to comply with the requirements, while beverage manufacturers with less than $10 million a year in sales will have an additional year.

However, this isn t the only labeling change likely to impact beverage-makers. In July, the U.S. Senate and House passed national GMO-labeling legislation. As of press time, President Barack Obama had not signed this legislation into law.

According to an Associated Press article, the law will require most food and beverage packages to carry a text label, a symbol or an electronic code readable by smartphone that indicates whether the product contains GMOs. The Department of Agriculture will have two years to write the new rules based on this legislation, the article added.

But just like the proactive nature of the beverage market, brand owners already are embracing change. The Beer Institute announced a new initiative to encourage its member companies to display specific consumer information on their products, packaging or websites.

The Brewers  Voluntary Disclosure Initiative states beer companies will voluntarily include a serving facts statement on products, disclose ingredients on either the labels or secondary packaging via a list of ingredients, and provide a reference to a website with the information or a QR code, the association says.

Among the companies agreeing to this standard are Anheuser-Busch, MillerCoors, Heineken USA, Constellation Brands Beer Division, North American Breweries and Craft Brew Alliance.","F&B"

Kelly Investment Group, a private-equity firm out of California that specializes in restructurings, has emerged to keep the chains  owner, Last Call Guarantor LLC, from being shut down.

Fun Eats and Drinks LLC, a Kelly subsidiary, recently acquired the rights to $75 million in first lien debt that Last Call had owed to Antares Capital. Kelly Investment then agreed to provide $5.4 million in financing to enable the company to continue operating through an expected auction next month, according to the filings.

Without the financing, Last Call said in bankruptcy filings that it would  not able to continue their business operations beyond August 30  through the use of available cash and needs the financing.

Indeed, just 10 days ago, Antares in a bankruptcy filing expressed doubt that any bidder for the company would emerge and pushed to have the bankruptcy converted to a Chapter 7   which would have shut down the restaurants and the operation.

 More than two months ago, [Last Call] hired an investment banker,  Antares said in its filing.  More than six weeks ago, potential bidders were contacted. More than four weeks ago, confidentiality agreements were signed and bidders were given access to sale information. More than two weeks ago, the deadline for indications of interests from potential bidders passed. No one has come forward with a viable bid. It is highly unlikely that anyone will come forward with a viable bid. 

Last Call s bankruptcy is its second since 2013. The company filed for federal debt protection with $117 million in debts. In bankruptcy documents, the company blamed a series of problems and failed decisions for its financial problems, including high turnover after it shifted workers to part-time in response to health care requirements.

Going into the bankruptcy, Fox and Hound had 48 locations, Bailey s had nine and Champps 23.

According to a company spokeswoman, Last Call now operates 37 Fox & Hound locations, four Bailey s and 14 Champps.

DMV Maple Investments controls Last Call, having acquired control of the company from the investment firm Cerberus last May.

Last Call has been seeking a buyer for its restaurants since June. Some potential buyers started working directly with the company s lender, Antares Capital. One of those buyers, Kelly Investment Group, agreed to buy Antares  debt.

In so doing, that put Kelly in the driver s seat in Last Call s bankruptcy. First-lien lenders are the first to be paid back in a bankruptcy.

Last Call then approached Kelly about financing to get it through next month s auction.

He sees his mission at the 409-unit chain as one of making it  compelling and convenient for our customers. 

Scicchitano joined Which Wich from his role as executive vice president for food and supply chain at Dallas-based Corner Bakery Cafe. Scicchitano was one of Corner Bakery s first employees when Chicago-based Lettuce Entertain You Enterprises created the brand in 1991. He worked with the company for 25 years.

Scicchitano is moving to a brand that is nearly fully franchised. Which Wich, founded in 2003, has more than 409 locations, with all but three units franchised. Corner Bakery has 195 units and is about 45-percent franchised.

Scicchitano spoke with Nation s Restaurant News about his new position:

What did you find enticing about Which Wich?

I m a fan of this brand. My family grew up on it: my kids from a young age, and my wife is a big fan of it. Of all the folks we compete against for sandwiches, Which Wich was the family brand. And I also had a chance to meet Jeff [Sinelli, the founder], and after a few meetings I really discovered the energy and the creativity of being around the founder of a really powerful and cool brand.

You did the same in the early days of Corner Bakery?

We started that back in Chicago, with Rich Melman of Lettuce Entertain You [Enterprises]. That was being driven under a founder mentality and then transitioned to all the various ownership groups. I found myself getting a lot of energy from that  founders  mentality.    I like being around brands that have that real positive force.

What distinguishes Which Wich from the many sandwich competitors?

You first have to start with the bag. That ordering system we have is fun and interesting. Some would call it quirky. My wife and I debate over how to use the bag and what we choose to do on the bag. We are all competing for the lunch dollar. We re all making sandwiches.   Vegetarians and vegans can come into our restaurants and get a little broader offering than they can going to another sandwich shop down the street.

How important is innovation for Which Wich?

We have a lot of new news. The culinarian in me, the food guy, loves the idea of getting to create new things. It s not just a static menu.

Your skill set is honed in on supply chain. How does that help in this new role?

I ve had a front-row seat to building a brand for 15 to 20 years, especially as we got into our stride of growth. Having all the responsibilities for culinary strategy, having all the responsibilities for our risk-management strategy on the supply-chain side, having a front seat on our marketing councils and our franchise advisory councils, really prepared me for a chance to see how big companies are run and how the departments are structured. And I ve had a chance to see what works and what doesn t work. So I bring those skills over to Which Wich.

We re putting 60 to 70 restaurants a year in the ground both domestically and internationally.

Where do you look to invest your time?

There s no doubt I ll probably spend more time in the R&D kitchen than I am in the IT lab. That s OK. That s where my energy takes me. If it has to do with food and the guest experience, I will spend most of my time there, along with our franchisees.

What s your look at the horizon?

I m bullish about Which Wich, and I m bullish about the industry still. We ve seen some down times, but the good news is we are a country that loves sandwiches.

While some restaurants are finalizing procedures and celebrating compliance ahead of schedule, many are now starting on the lengthy process. The question is: What is the most efficient way to get it done?

 It almost always takes more time than you expect to make sure everything is accurate and ready to incorporate onto menus and menu boards,  said Mary Parsons, MS, RD, culinary dietitian at Healthy Dining.  There is time needed to make sure the recipes are accurate, to gather product labels from suppliers, and for quality assurance and verification. To avoid being held up by unexpected roadblocks, it s safest for restaurants to start nutrition analysis projects several months in advance of the date that you plan to print. 

With less than a year now before compliance is mandated, Healthy Dining s team recommends that restaurants break the process down into six steps to make the countdown to compliance a strategic process that won t sacrifice accuracy or customer trust.

1.    Complete or verify menu nutrition analysis.

      If you re starting from scratch, work with a restaurant nutrition expert to analyze your recipes. The first step in menu analysis will be finalizing your standardized recipes, and then completing nutrition analysis of all standard menu items. 

      If you already have nutrition information for standard menu items, now is the time to confirm the accuracy of the existing analysis. Recipes, ingredients and even suppliers change frequently, affecting the accuracy of your restaurant s nutrition information. Customers and inspectors will both expect accurate and complete information readily available by the May 5, 2017, compliance deadline.

2.    Re-design menus and menu boards.

 Once you have accurate and complete nutrition information for your standard menu items, determine how best to incorporate the required calorie information and statements into your menus and menu boards. From your basic offerings, to variable menu items and beverages, menu labeling regulations are very specific in how calorie information must be posted. Review the FDA rules for presenting this information and/or work with a vendor well versed in the requirements to help ensure accuracy and compliance.

3.    Determine how to present additional required information.

 Calorie counts on the menu are just one part of the compliance puzzle. Whether it s a binder, brochure or iPad, presenting the additional required nutrition information will look different for each restaurant. Take a close look at your processes and procedures to determine the best long-term solution for maintaining accurate information. If print is the best route for your brand, design presentation materials. If technology is the best route, begin researching solutions.

4.    Print new menus and materials.

 Menus, menu boards, brochures, binders and similar materials will need to be printed with calories, required statements and additional nutrients.

5.    Distribute new materials to locations.

 Once printing is complete, make sure that each location has the most current and accurate materials on site. This may include menus and menu boards with calories and required statements, brochures with additional information, and signed statements. If you do not already have a process in place, determine how to maintain accurate materials required for menu labeling compliance at all locations moving forward.

6.    Train staff.

 Determining a plan for training location-level management, back of house and front of house, on the basics of the regulations and staff roles in compliance is essential to maintaining compliance. Whether you create an internal training program or rely on a third-party training program, ensure that every member of your staff understands his or her role in maintaining and providing accurate nutrition information.

The menu labeling clock is ticking, and restaurants nationwide are moving to comply. If you are just beginning on the process, don t wait. Start moving forward now to meet the May 5, 2017, menu labeling compliance deadline.","Restaurants and Food Services"

Ryan Valentine, director of beverage and operating partner, and Andrea Hoover, beverage operations manager, recently discussed the evolution of the company s cocktail, wine and beer programs, as well as the changing demands of its customers.

Let s talk about Millennials and beverages. Are they still enjoying sweet wine?

Ryan Valentine: We are still selling a lot of Moscato [a sweet varietal], but ros  is the one that s all over everybody s restaurant. Watch out for ros  Champagne: People love bubbles, and the ros s are more interesting [than white Champagnes].

I never thought Moscatos would get as big as they did, but what I love about Millennials is that there s no pattern to what they do or how they think. So it s fun.

People my age, we find brands or varietals and spirits that we like, and we have this life allegiance to them. What I like about [Millennials] is that if you work really hard on different parts of your beverage program, they ll come in and appreciate all of it. They ll come in and drink beer one night, then they ll come in and drink cocktails, and the next night they ll drink wine. And they ll bounce around between real inexpensive wine and then they might buy some expensive [wine].

Does Millennials  willingness to try new things make it easier or harder to guide them to try new things?

Valentine: I think it s more meeting their interests. They re coming in and looking for things both on the food side and the beverage side. So it s an opportunity to make a point of differentiation.

If two places have a great steak, maybe one place s sangria or margarita is so good [that it makes them choose that restaurant over the other].

I think we re trying to meet the range of their interests.

Andrea Hoover: With Millennials, when they have the story of what we do and who we are and we establish that trust, then anything s game.

Is there an example of a drink you introduced in recent years that if you had done it 10 years ago people would have ignored it?

Valentine: Eight years ago we couldn t have given away a punch, but now we change them seasonally and if we don t bring the bourbon one back in the fall, they get upset. That s when you can tell that people are changing. To have people come to a restaurant for a certain food item has historically happened, but for them to clamor for a specific drink, that s much more rare.

If you re not thinking in terms of having a destination beverage program, you re in enormous trouble, because that s a huge part of people s expectations now. It better be dynamic, and it better be changing.

When we started doing fresh cocktails 11 years ago, it wasn t a very crowded game. Now everyone s in it, and it s spinning so much faster. Now we re seeing sherry, last year it was amaro. All the ingredients that keep fueling all the diversity, it s crazy, but it makes it dynamic, and it means the guest can keep coming back and finding new things, so it s fun from that standpoint.","Restaurants and Food Services"

When the Oak Brook, Ill.-based burger giant recalled its Step-it step-counters from its kids meals earlier this month over concerns about skin irritation, it provided some insight into how important those meals really are.

According to information from the research firm Sense360, McDonald s averaged 22 million visits per day from Aug. 9 through Aug. 17, when the chain was running its step counter Happy Meal promotion.

McDonald s said it gave out 29 million step counters during that time, or 3.2 million per day.

In other words, 14.6 percent of customers ordered Happy Meals, according to Sense360   generating $10 million in revenue per day.

Of course, the kids aren t going to McDonald s on their own, and so the real impact of those Happy Meals is much larger. Because most parents aren t going to McDonald s just to watch their kids munch on Chicken McNuggets.

Which is why the big burger chain has been so quick to reshape its Happy Meals in recent years to address concerns about the company s impact on childhood health. The chain has added fresh fruit, such as apple slices and mandarin oranges. Earlier this year, the company said it had sold 2 billion servings of fresh fruit and yogurt since 2012.

That s probably also why the company put step counters in those Happy Meals to encourage kids to get moving. That plan backfired.

"Report: Restaurants need to be more transparent about food safety"," Foodborne illness prevention likely to become key investor focus, Cornerstone Capital Group report says
 


  read more  ","http://nrn.com/operations/report-restaurants-need-be-more-transparent-about-food-safety","Tue, 30 Aug 2016 18:56:00 +0000","Operations","Report: Restaurants need to be more transparent about food safetyPublic restaurant companies have room for improvement when it comes to disclosing food-safety risks, and shareholders should consider how companies mitigate that risk before investing.

So says a recent report from Cornerstone Capital Group called  Food Safety: In a State of Transformation,  commissioned by Investor Responsibility Research Center Institute, an independent research group that focuses on corporate governance.

 We definitely think there is room to improve,  said Mike Shavel, global thematic analyst with Cornerstone Capital, and one of the study s authors.  Restaurants gave the least amount of disclosure throughout the food-supply chain. They really do need to take this more seriously in terms of providing disclosure to their customers, but also their investors. 

The report examined a number of food-safety events across the food industry over the last 25 years that have impacted public companies, from an E. coli outbreak at Jack in the Box in 1993, to a series of illness outbreaks at Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. last year.

The food-safety practices and disclosures of about 60 companies across the food industry were evaluated, including grocery companies, meat and produce suppliers, food manufacturers, and distributors.

Looking at a sample of 14 publicly traded restaurant companies, which were not identified, the report found that the majority provided some detail on supplier management systems and noted food safety as a risk in annual reports.

But few disclosed information about internal safety systems and external food-safety certification practices, or the key performance indices tracked to measure performance.

Only one company tied executive compensation to food safety, and one had a board member with food-safety expertise, the report found.

Having a board member focused on food safety doesn t diminish the fact that companies can hire experts, said Sebastian Vanderzeil, a Cornerstone Capital research analyst and a report author. But it does add a layer of credibility for restaurants, he said.

About half of the companies disclosed information about the traceability of ingredients, the report noted. And three companies disclosed sick-leave policies for workers.

Although the report avoided mentioning specific companies, a few were highlighted for notable practices.

For example, Starbucks Corp. has implemented a product traceability program that allows the company to track 100 percent of the raw materials in any product within four hours.

The report also cited Darden Restaurants Inc. for product traceability and setting leading supply-chain standards.

These are the sort of policies shareholders should ask about, Shavel said.

 They should say,  Starbucks has 100-percent product traceability within four hours. How fast can you do it?  And let the company answer,  Shavel said.  That really informs you how the company thinks about food safety, and it if makes it to the C-suite level. 

The report also cited Panera Bread, Texas Roadhouse, The Cheesecake Factory and Jack in the Box for implementing Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Points, or HACCP, systems and food preparation protocols.

Chipotle, McDonald s and The Cheesecake Factory were listed as disclosing sick-leave policies, although the report noted that the level of detail disclosed about such policies varies by company.

Such policies can be somewhat  fluffy,  Shavel said. Companies may say managers can adjust schedules if workers are not feeling well, for example.","Restaurants and Food Services"

New data from market research firm The NPD Group reveals that despite the country s economic recovery, a staggering number of independent restaurants have closed in the last four years, while the number of chain restaurants continues to grow.

 Independents are declining across the board, with some of the steepest declines occurring in the largest markets,  said NPD analyst Bonnie Riggs.  It s a tough market. They just have not been able to compete. 

According to The NPD Group s ReCount database, which tracks commercial restaurant units across the U.S., there are 19,000 fewer independent restaurants today than there were in 2012. Compare that to chains, which have added 17,000 more locations in the last four years.

While the increased chain competition is part of what s behind the decline of independents, Riggs says there are other contributing factors.

 As more chains come on the scene, it s difficult for independents to keep up with marketing dollars,  Riggs said.  [Also,] a lot of independent restaurants didn't stay relevant in terms of consumer needs. 

Independent restaurants have been declining most in the Mountain region, which includes Oregon, Washington and California; the Mid Atlantic region, which includes New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey; and the West North Central region, which includes the Dakotas, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa and Minnesota. In the year ended March 2016, independent unit counts fell 4 percent in each of these regions.

Other regions experiencing a notable decline in independent restaurants during the same period include the South Atlantic, New England and East North Central. Only three regions   East South Central, West South Central and Pacific   have managed to hold steady, with a decline of 1 percent or less in independent restaurants.

Among independents across the country, those that are doing best are quick-service restaurants in the bakery-snack and varied menu categories, followed by casual-dining restaurants in the seafood and ethnic categories.

Although the odds are stacked against independent restaurateurs in the U.S., many have found a formula to keep customers coming back, including the owners of Malai Kitchen, a Vietnamese and Thai casual-dining restaurant in Dallas, and Solomon & Kuff, a Caribbean restaurant and rum hall in New York City.

Malai Kitchen, a casual-dining restaurant in Dallas that specializes in Vietnamese and Thai cuisines, along with house-made Sriracha and house-brewed Thai beer, stands out in a land of steak and potatoes.

 What we have here is something different, unique,  said Yasmin Wages, who co-owns Malai Kitchen with her husband, executive chef Braden Wages.  We re showcasing something that s increasingly more popular. 

But being different in a sea of sameness isn t the only thing that has helped this five-year-old eatery grow year-over-year sales by 12 to 15 percent.

 [We have] a top-line philosophy   it means invest, invest, invest and people will come,  Wages said.  The moment you start skimping, you lose people s trust. 

That investment strategy has translated into everything from using only the best quality ingredients (fresh, not frozen), to annually updating the dining room d cor, to growing with customer needs by participating in new food delivery services.

Wages knows she can t compete with the fat marketing budgets of national restaurant chains, so she relies instead on serving top-quality food and training her staff to deliver an exceptional dining experience in order to generate positive word-of-mouth. The restaurant also generates buzz with the help of a public relations firm.

 It forces us to stay creative. To think of new ways to make us sound cool and neat,  Wages said.  You have to constantly stay relevant or you will not succeed. 

Partners Julie Grunberger and Karl Franz Williams know a thing or two about what it takes to keep an independent restaurant open in highly competitive New York City.

Before opening their 5,000-square-foot Caribbean restaurant and rum hall in late 2015, Williams, who has two other concepts open, and Grun had gone through the experience of having to close a restaurant.

 Competing in New York is tough,  said Williams.  For independents, two things are critical: experience, [having] the right kind of experienced people, [and being] properly capitalized. If you don t have these two things, you re going to struggle. 

The partners are both experienced and well capitalized, and the uniqueness and authenticity of their island concept   something the duo says chains simply can t do as well   is a big draw. But they know firsthand that it is tough to compete with the voice, scale and marketing dollars of large restaurant operators.

But they are finding their own way to get scale by leveraging their previous ownership experience and Williams  other restaurants to obtain more favorable deals with vendors, and even with their public relations firm. Additionally, in the past Williams has met scale challenges by banding together with other small business to form buying groups.

 Scale is necessary. All things that are challenges for independents are less challenging because of the other two restaurants,  said Williams.  The small business myth   it s the American dream. Really, the American dream starts when you have scale. ","Restaurants and Food Services"

In a presentation released last week, Sandell reiterated its long-held view that BEF Foods  value is not fully reflected in the company s stock price, which trades mostly on the performance of the restaurant chain.

The activist, which has struggled to convince Bob Evans to sell the division even after placing several directors on the company s board two years ago, estimates that BEF Foods is worth $1.2 billion.

Bob Evans  total enterprise value, or the company s total value including market capitalization and debt, is about $1.1 billion, according to Yahoo! Finance.

Given the value of BEF Foods compared with the valuations of other publicly traded food companies like Hormel suggests investors are giving Bob Evans  restaurant division a negative valuation.

 This is made all the more shocking when one considers the company still wholly owns the land and buildings to 305 of its operating restaurants along with 21 of its closed properties,  Sandell wrote. Bob Evans operates 527 restaurants in 18 states, mostly in the Midwest.

Sandell has been an activist in Bob Evans since 2013 and currently owns 7 percent of the company s stock. It won four seats to the company s board the next year, a substantial say but not a majority. Bob Evans has since replaced its CEO and has undergone a series of sale-leaseback deals, selling company property and leasing it back from the buyers.

But Bob Evans has held steadfast in its belief that the company would be better off keeping the division. Saed Mohseni, Bob Evans  CEO, said earlier this year that the company trades at a higher valuation, given the restaurant chain s sales struggles in recent years, because of the presence of the packaged foods division.

Sandell, however, has intensified pressure on the company to reconsider that position. Earlier this year, the investor hinted that it could make another run at the board if Bob Evans doesn t sell BEF Foods.

The activist believes the presence of the restaurant company hides the presence of the packaged foods subsidiary.

BEF Foods has substantially higher profit margins than the restaurants. Bob Evans Restaurants in the most recent fiscal year had a cash flow margin of 12.1 percent. BEF Foods had a cash flow margin of 23.4 percent, according to the presentation. BEF Foods made up 44 percent of the company s cash flow last fiscal year despite having only about a third of the company s revenue.

Bob Evans trades at a multiple of 7.8 times cash flow, far lower than average   8.9 times cash flow   for mostly company-operated restaurant chains. By comparison, according to Sandell, packaged foods companies on average trade at multiples of 13.7 times cash flow.

Sandell also argues that there are few opportunities for the packaged foods division and the restaurant division to work together to lower costs. BEF Foods operates independently, with a separate management team. Mohseni, meanwhile, comes from a restaurant chain background, having most recently been the CEO of Bravo Brio Restaurant Group Inc..

The investor also believes that BEF Foods could be better off away from Bob Evans because it would be able to sell products licensed from other restaurant chains.

The investor also calls the division a  distraction  that could hamper Mohseni s ability to reinvigorate Bob Evans. Same-store sales at the chain fell 2.5 percent in the most recent fiscal year. But traffic fell 5.4 percent.

Snuffer s Restaurant & Bar is calling an audible and rolling out a fresh, exciting new burger much earlier than expected.

On Sunday, Sept. 11, the legendary Dallas brand will debut the all-new Dakburger, once considered its  Burger of the Future  but now pressed into service on an accelerated timetable. Chefs in Snuffer s Arlington restaurant have been working on the Dakburger since late April, after discovering a promising recipe on a scouting trip to Mississippi.

 The Dakburger has performed surprisingly well in limited testing, but we were planning to keep tweaking it in the kitchen for another year or so before rolling it out to compete alongside the veteran burgers on our menu,  said Tim Schroder, Snuffer s Vice President of Operations Services.  We hope the Dakburger will become an immediate star and carry our menu for the next 10 years. Or at least the next six to 10 weeks. 

The Dakburger is a 100% fresh ground chuck burger topped with Applewood smoked bacon strips, Hickory BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese and red onions on a poppy seed bun. Priced at just $7.79, the burger will stay in Snuffer s starting lineup as long as it performs well. (Prices and participation may vary by location.)



 Burger lovers and anyone who enjoys rooting for the new kid on the block are invited to come by their favorite Snuffer s on Sunday, Sept. 11, watch some football and see if the Dakburger lives up to its lofty expectations,  continued Schroder.  We know it s a whole new ballgame when we take a rookie burger from test phase to the real action, but we love what we ve seen so far. We think the Dakburger will pass with flying colors and become an instant fan favorite. 

Snuffer s now has 11 restaurants throughout North Texas, with its newest location now open in Greenville, TX. For the restaurant nearest you, and more information on the entire menu, visit Snuffers.com.

The iconic Snuffer s Restaurant & Bar brand has been a Dallas institution since 1978, serving its signature menu of legendary Burgers and famous Cheddar Fries. Snuffer s is the perfect place for guests to catch up with friends and family, watch a game or enjoy a casual happy hour after work. Open seven days a week, there are currently 11 Snuffer s restaurants throughout North Texas, with its newest location now open in Greenville, TX.

Are we providing superior levels of guest service? Are we promoting achievable standards of service? Is our service consistent across our entire system of restaurants? These are all important questions for businesses to ask of themselves and their employees, but it is even more important to not lose sight of what  service  truly means on a fundamental level. It means to be useful or helpful   and that absolutely must begin at the leadership level and permeate all levels of the corporate culture if we wish for it to have significant meaning in our day-to-day operations.

When we looked at the social landscape facing employees in the Church s network, it became clear that service must be a two-way street. Today s employers in the quick-service restaurant field cannot simply offer jobs and call it  opportunity.  We ve all seen the challenges for minimum-wage-earners   whether they be students, young adults, parents, or families. To truly provide opportunity from a  service  mentality means to provide useful, helpful ways for our team members to grow personally and professionally, and enjoy benefits such as financial stability and security.

This is what led us to establish both our Stride for Success High School Diploma program and our Church s Scholars college scholarship program   so that we could positively influence quick-service restaurants in a way that was mutually beneficial for our employees and our customers. In turn, we as a business are able to reap the rewards of an engaged, motivated workforce with less turnover and training costs. Many believed those goals to be too lofty for both programs, but the actual results have been overwhelming.

Since the Stride for Success program began a year ago, we ve had 27 shift leaders actively working to complete their high-school educations. When they do, they ll instantly meet one of the requirements for promotion to manager. With that comes an increase in pay and the chance for further advancement within the Church s network. Our first graduates completed the program in (December 2015), and more  finished their coursework a few weeks ago.  And, we are preparing to accept applications for our next class of graduates. What started as  just a job  for these employees is now becoming a true career opportunity, which we strongly value at Church s. Even at the higher-education level, we re finding that serving up access and removing barriers is energizing our entire workforce.

The Church s Scholars program provides $1000 scholarships to students to apply towards college expenses. The program is available to both employees and to high school seniors in the communities Church s serves.  The first year we awarded 50 scholarships, had 175 in the second year, and this year we will be awarding 225 scholarships. We expect that number to keep growing. Serving people through education is something everyone wants   employees, company leadership, the community   everyone wins.

What becomes important to realize is that while education is something everyone wants, it s not always so simple for everyone to obtain. Some families rely on their high-school age children to provide extra income from a job, which takes away time to successfully complete their studies. The costs of college continue to rise, with student loans simply not an option for many who may be the first in their families to pursue a college degree. We re doing what we can at Church s to remove at least some of the financial barrier   so that those who want to obtain diplomas need only take the time to do so.

 Serve Yourself First,  is a phrase that sums up our approach to education and its impact on company morale. If we really want to talk about  service  and  opportunity  we have to make it possible for our employees to serve themselves first. We cannot reasonably expect our team to serve others well if their own needs have not been met. At Church s we recognized that by helping to meet those needs, we could establish a foundation for loyalty, growth, and an overall stronger system. In telling others to  Serve Yourself First,  we ve been able to raise the bar on what it means to work in the quick-service restaurant industry.

After opening its first Dallas location to huge crowds and a  never-ending line,  The Halal Guys is launching its next location in Richardson Restaurant Park slated to open in November 2016. The Richardson Restaurant Park location is a brand new dining destination featuring numerous food concepts and is conveniently located along the Central Expressway. The fast-casual New York famed concept opened its first Dallas location at 5444 Lemmon Avenue this past July and have plans to bring more units throughout the area. Famously known for its famous white sauce, gyro sandwiches and chicken-and-rice platters, The Halal Guys menu offers a mix of different Middle Eastern dishes.

 Richardson Restaurant Park is going to be the newest premier foodie destination in the Dallas area with several other food concepts. Strategically we think this is area needs more dining options and we are very excited to bring The Halal Guys to a growing community,  said Operating Partner, Danny Bui.

Since the opening on July 23rd, The Halal Guys  cult-like following skyrocketed with a never-ending line wrapped around the parking lot with guests willing to wait over two hours to try their famous sandwiches and platters. Despite the long wait time, the consensus was that the brick-and-mortar location in Dallas had delivered the same flavors as the original food carts in New York and the long lines remain.

The Halal Guys aim to be different and encourage patrons across America to try something unique. They pride on only using high-quality products like their chicken, which has never been frozen and is marinated and seasoned overnight, then cooked and chopped on the grill and served directly to their plate to ensure a crave worthy meal that s piping hot. The Halal Guys  mission is to ensure that every customer leaves happy, with a smile on their face and a satisfaction that brings them back again.

The Halal Guys grew from its humble beginnings as a food cart on the streets of New York City to a global icon known as the largest American halal street food concept in the world. This Manhattan-based landmark was created by three like-minded men from Egypt who came to America in search of a better life. When Mohamed Abouelenein, Ahmed Elsaka and Abdelbaset Elsayed noticed many Muslim cab drivers in New York were looking for a place to buy meals in Manhattan, they created their first food cart and quickly grew into a leading tourist and native New Yorker destination for American Halal fare. In 2013, The Halal Guys were ranked the most popular food truck reviewed on FourSquare and the third most Yelped restaurant in the United States in 2014.

Among being awarded the 2014 Multicultural Award at The 5th American Muslim Consumer Conference, The Halal Guys have also been recognized by TIME Magazine, Entrepreneur Magazine, The New York Times and The Huffington Post.

Consider this: one in three Americans gain their first work experience in a restaurant and three fourths of restaurant employees believe they have the opportunity for career advancement in the industry.

The Who Works in the U.S. Restaurant Industry report by the National Restaurant Association Educational Foundation shows that first jobs in the restaurant sector help people learn and develop crucial skills and attributes necessary to be successful in the workforce   regardless of industry.

Some of these skills include:

According to information from the National Restaurant Association, the restaurant industry remains the nation s second-largest private sector employer this year, with a workforce of 14.4 million. Jobs in the industry represent an excellent way for people to gain valuable career-building knowledge and skills, as well as explore the diverse array of career opportunities in food service.

As the philanthropic foundation of the National Restaurant Association, the NRAEF exists to enhance the restaurant industry s service to the public through education, community engagement and promotion of career opportunities. The NRAEF works to attract, develop and retain a career-oriented professional workforce for the restaurant industry. In 2016, the restaurant and foodservice industry is projected to provide a record 14.4 million jobs, making it the nation s second largest private sector employer.

His Economist s Notebook commentary and analysis appears regularly on Restaurant.org and Restaurant TrendMapper.

Recent concerns of a  restaurant recession  are largely misplaced.  Just as economists wouldn t say the overall economy was in a recession if just a few sectors were struggling, the same shouldn t be said about the restaurant industry based on the results of a handful of companies.

While same-store sales and customer traffic trends were certainly a mixed bag in recent months, that doesn t paint a complete picture on the health of the overall restaurant industry.  A better performance metric is total restaurant industry sales, which includes both existing restaurant sales as well as sales at new restaurants that enter the market.  By this measure, the restaurant industry remains on a positive trajectory.

According to data from the U.S. Census Bureau, total eating and drinking place sales were up 6.0 percent on year-to-date basis through July 2016.  Adjusting for menu-price inflation, sales were up about 3.3 percent during the first seven months of the year.  This real growth rate is right in line with the average annual gains registered during the last five years, which suggests the restaurant industry expansion is maintaining its post-recession track.

That s not to say that consumers aren t somewhat unsettled, and a chunk of that uncertainly could likely be traced to the vitriol coming from the U.S. presidential campaign.  In fact, 31 percent of adults say they have become less confident about their personal spending as a result of the presidential campaign during the last few months, according to a new national survey conducted August 18-21 by ORC International for the National Restaurant Association.  Fourteen percent say they are more confident, while 55 percent say it hasn t impacted their personal spending.

However, thanks to the resilient American consumer, the overall restaurant industry is growing.  Here are five reasons why the expansion will continue in the months ahead:

The number-one driver of restaurant sales is a healthy labor market.  When people are employed, they have both the income to support spending as well as the daily need for the convenient food and beverage options that the restaurant industry provides.

While the current economic expansion has generally lacked explosiveness, it has been remarkably consistent, with gains of at least 2.1 million jobs each year since the end of the Great Recession.  Job growth is on a similar pace in 2016, including the addition of more than a half-million jobs during the last two months alone.

The restaurant industry has never contracted without a corresponding decline in the labor market, and there are currently no indications that job losses are on the horizon.

Although wage growth has been noticeably stagnant during the current expansion, there are signs that it is finally starting to pick up.  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), the average hourly earnings for all private sector employees rose 2.6 percent between July 2015 and July 2016.  This matched the strongest 12-month wage growth during the economic recovery, though it was still below the mid-three-percent gains posted before the recession.

Other factors should lead to stronger wage growth in the months ahead.  As the economy moves toward full employment and the jobless rate drops, businesses typically have to compete harder for talent in a shrinking labor pool.

A healthy labor market also gives workers the confidence and ability to leave one job for a higher paying job somewhere else.  According to BLS data, an average of 2.3 percent of private sector workers quit their jobs each month during the first half of 2016.  This represented the highest half-year quit rate since 2007.

If wages continue to rise and inflation remains modest as expected, consumers will have more disposable income to support additional discretionary spending.

Household debt is rising steadily.  Total revolving credit balances are approaching $1 trillion for the first time since 2008, according to data from the Federal Reserve.  However, a key difference between now and eight years ago is the fact that households are much more equipped to handle this level of debt.

The Federal Reserve s Financial Obligations Ratio, which is the ratio of total required household debt payments (plus rent on primary residences, auto lease payments, insurance and property tax payments) to total disposable income, is nearly three points below 2008 levels and hovering near an all-time record low.

Households are also building up a financial cushion, with savings rates in recent months roughly double what they were just prior to the Great Recession.  Consumers also continue to benefit from relatively low gas prices, as well as grocery store prices that are on pace to decline for the first time since 1967.  These all put additional disposable income in the pockets of consumers.

Many consumers are also benefiting from rising wealth, which has a positive impact on spending.  House prices are trending higher, and all three major U.S. stock indices have closed at record highs during August.

Although overall sales are trending higher, consumers have yet to get their fill of restaurants.  According to a national survey conducted in April 2016 by ORC International for the National Restaurant Association, 45 percent of adults say they are not eating on the premises of restaurants as frequently as they would like.  Similarly, 46 percent of consumers say they are not purchasing take-out or delivery as often as they would like.

Not surprisingly, pent-up demand is higher among lower-income households, as six in 10 consumers in households with income below $35,000 say they would like to be using restaurants more frequently.  However, fully one in four adults living in households with income above $100,000 also say they are not patronizing restaurants as often as they would like.

As households with income above $100,000 are responsible for four in 10 dollars spent in restaurants, any degree of unfulfilled demand is an encouraging sign for the industry in the months ahead.

While there is always some degree of unfulfilled demand for restaurants, the current levels are well above historical norms.  In the mid-2000s, only about one in four adults said they weren t eating at restaurants as often as they would like   or just over half of the level that exists today.

In the aftermath of the Great Recession, consumers became very selective in their spending habits, which resulted in some sectors doing much better than others.  One of the reasons why the restaurant industry held up relatively well during a challenging economic environment has been a shift in consumers  spending habits toward experiences.

When given the choice of how they would spend an additional $100 if they had it, more than four in 10 adults say they would spend it on an experience such as a restaurant or other activity.  Fifty-eight percent say they would be more likely to purchase an item from a store.

Among consumers in households with income above $75,000, one-half say they would be more likely to spend their extra $100 on an experience.

In times of a tough economic climate, it s no secret that consumers have become increasingly cautious and fearful.  Today, as fears of losing one s job and looking at their dwindling 401(k) statement, consumers are scared.  So what can a restaurant really do to attract cautious guests? Remember:  People still have to eat!

If choice becomes the highest currency of the day, restaurateurs should take heed.  People love spending time going out to eat, but with less money, choice is imperative and how do you become the restaurant of choice?

Consumers choose brands that engage them and make them feel they are spending their time well.  They re gravitating more toward experience than assets and goods.  Finding ways to make your restaurant brand  add life to the experience  should be a priority on any restaurant marketer s to-do list.  Become the consumer s choice since they still have to eat!

Today restaurant operators are being bombarded with companies that have sprung up overnight that claim to provide social media for restaurants, however, operators should be careful to understand how social media fits in with their overall marketing plan first, not how they can just do social media to do what everyone else is doing.  Social media needs to be PART of the overall marketing plan and incorporated with other forms of traditional media and outreach methods.  We call it integrated marketing communications and it is the most effective marketing method to create a successful brand.

Don t be quick to rush into social media, you wouldn t rush into buying television advertising or writing a press release (we hope not), so take your time to understand the time commitment involved before engaging in social media for your restaurant brand.

The Internet and online is beginning to show itself as a very cost effective way to engage guests and generate awareness and a fan base.  Text ordering and online ordering are showing real worth to restaurant operators and in my opinion, will proliferate to all restaurants as the norm in the near future.

The social media philosophy:  is an ongoing commitment to engage customers in meaningful and authentic ways   transparency.  It is about listening to your customers concerns and interests.

Social Media marketing tactics work best with anything that has a beginning and an end; a promotion, an event, a specific call to action or campaign, which is perfectly suited for restaurant operators and limited time offers and builds frequency and loyalty with fans of your brand.

E-mail newsletters, blogs and other social media should be a part of the overall marketing mix. The best way restaurant operators or entrepreneurs can incorporate Social Media into their marketing mix is to focus on these objectives:



#3:   Be a Chef-Rateur and Include your Crew

Every restaurant operator who also manages the back of the house and food, is what I call a  Chef-Rateur  and every Chef-Rateur should be prepared for in today s competitive landscape to run a successful restaurant.  Most Chef s have the food, menus, and back of the house understanding, but what about the impact the chef can make with guests?  With the local community?  Are you ready for TV, interviews, the Food Network?  What kind of menu items sell and how to promote them?

Chef-Rateurs should include employees in marketing decisions. Employees have the most contact with your guests, and have insight to guests  needs and wants.  Always engage and get ideas from your team.  This will keep them involved, informed and excited about the promotions or other marketing activities within your organization and restaurant.

Keeping your employees informed about promotions is very important to your success. Have a bulletin board or white board that is used exclusively to inform your employees about what is going on, when and what their responsibilities are during the event or promotion.

If you decide to offer a new product, make sure that you let your employees try it first. This way they can tell customers about how much they like the product or answer important questions for inquisitive customers.

Hold a meeting to teach your staff about the important points they need to know about the promotion and how to work the register differently if need be. Also if you have introduced a new product make sure that your staff knows how to make it perfectly so that you can insure accuracy and precision.

Employees should be awarded for their help during promotions because while you may have implemented the idea, employees carry out the promotion for the duration that it is planned to go on. Give them rewards for clean up, increase in sales or general improvements on the restaurant cost or personal achievements.

A great way give incentives is to track employee s previous sales or achievements and have them make new goals based on their old ones. Award those with a gift if they complete any of their goals.

Believe in your promotion. Make sure that you let your employees know every day that they are doing a great job and that you re excited about the promotion.

Other helpful hints to keep in mind:

Developing strategic partnerships and vendor alliances are important to the success of your restaurant. Strategic partnerships can include community organizations, the national cheese or beef councils, or other food manufacturers. Vendor partners such as your soda, beer and wine, liquor, food distributor, and any other product suppliers can all provide your restaurant with opportunities to promote your brand and theirs at the same time.  Typically vendors have a budget to provide promotional materials, cooperative dollars from the manufacturer and cool give-away items.  It is important to create good relationships with strategic partners and vendors to develop joint promotions to increase customer loyalty and frequency.

Some of the best partners are restaurant operator s vendors such as their beverage supplier and food distributor.  They typically have ideas for promotions and can provide in some cases, product to give-away, promotional dollars to use for a menu item photo shoot or develop collateral (table tents) and using their brand can also boost customer satisfaction.

Other strategic partnerships that can boost sales include working with food manufacturers.  California Cheese sometimes provides monetary support to operators who use their logo on printed menus in California, and the Beef Council provided a radio media buy with  Beef its what s for dinner  tagged at the end at no cost for one of my multi-unit operator client s.

There are hundreds of food manufacturers out there and they all provide menu development ideas.  Beverage brands, Pepsi and Coke, food manufacturers like Blueberry Council, beef council, milk council, rice council, avocados, grapes, etc.   National food manufacturers  sample list of websites.

Local Store Marketing, or generating awareness and sales within the restaurant s 3-5 mile radius, is the most underutilized marketing strategy by restaurant operators.

The reason for this is most local store marketing tactics require time and effort which for some operators is tough.  They would rather run an advertisement or a coupon to drive traffic so they don t have to spend time or effort.  However, with the right tactics, easy directions or training, any restaurant employee could assist with these local efforts, which garner big results without much investment.

Get moving and get out of the four walls and take menu samples and offer to cater or invite people in with a free appetizer coupon.

#6.   Think of your restaurant as a VENUE

Fundraisers:  Everyone is hurting so offer to host a fundraiser and a percentage of proceeds will go to the organization they eat and pay, you give 20% to them.

:  There are social groups like the Red Hat Ladies and Mahjong or Bridge groups to invite to use your restaurant for their monthly or weekly meetings.  Also, car clubs, motorcycle or vintage cars all have get-togethers and your restaurant can be their meeting spot.

: Get feedback from your customers by hosting an in-restaurant focus group. Select a certain day and time to interview guests at your restaurant. Conduct this type of interview on Saturday afternoons when people are not rushed or busy.  It is best to offer an incentive for participating.   This can be a free entr e card or complimentary menu item.

called a focus group with a table of 10-15 customers. This setting allows open dialog with your interviewees. Ask questions about the service, products and atmosphere of the restaurant.

from the customers on their preferences, their perceptions and what creates an emotional connection to your brand. These answers will help you convey what makes your brand different or what could make your brand better.

#7:   Use your food instead of cash!

It s really a huge opportunity to use your food instead of cash.  They could use menu samples (i.e. chips and salsa, pot stickers, pizza, cookies, etc.) or signature menu items to entice new business and drive catering sales.  By using food cost (30 cents on the dollar) instead of advertising cost   you can make a bigger impact if you are willing to get out and take samples to targeted businesses or groups by getting your food right in their mouths!  If times are tough get out and sample!  This makes people want to try a restaurant or reminds them to come back.  It is the easiest and most overlooked marketing tactic restaurant operators can use.

-take food to the radio DJ s and provide free meal coupons to let them give-away on the air, call your local TV station and offer to bring food onto their morning show or demonstrate your menu item, or do a publicity stunt   such as, Denny s free grand slam breakfast.

Socially Responsible Marketing is doing social good!  Touting health benefits were a big focus for many years and now green and socially responsible marketing are the big focus for businesses and consumers alike. With so much powerful scientific data and more frequent communications, it is making it hard for consumers to ignore.

Consumer demand for green and environmentally friendly products is growing but still in the early stages.  Green claims are on the rise and every company is claiming to be green and socially responsible.  What does this mean for your restaurant?  Socially Responsible Marketing will soon become standard operating procedure for all restaurant operators.

A business vision may be necessary for business success, but it is no longer sufficient   having a  social vision  is imperative today and restaurant operators must get with the program.

Work with your distributor by asking what products you can order which are made or grown locally.  It is surprising how many already have sources for  organic  and  sustainable  lines now available.  This helps by distributing you money locally, statewide or nationally, which will help employ and support local, state and national producers and companies.  This will increase the velocity of the dollar, offering you a return in investment by helping to create a healthy economy.

How does this benefit you?  It is good PR.  By using menus, signage, check presenters and just having you and your people tell others of your efforts, you create goodwill, loyal customers, and ambassadors willing to share your story bringing more business to your table.  Restaurants have the ability to become part of the solution by taking an active part, thinking where their money is being spent.

#9:   Get on the LSM Diet!

The best recommendation for restaurant operators is to focus on their 3-5 mile radius as their own niche.  Local community involvement is the glue that holds all marketing and advertising efforts together and makes them effective. The local community is a great niche to focus.  If you are not visibly active within the 3-5 mile radius surrounding your restaurant, you don t stand a chance against the larger chains who can afford mass media and advertising.

Local Store Marketing success doesn t happen unless you make a commitment to change behaviors and habits just like a diet.  The LSM Diet, (a specific workshop within Local Store Marketing University certification course),  is a philosophy for operators to understand the importance of local store marketing and how it can provide  ROI-Return on Involvement.  Operators need to get out and get involved with the community.  Business success is earned, not given, in today s economy.

Just like a diet, the LSM Diet requires and investment of time and effort.  In order to lose weight, exercise is recommended along with resistance training, aerobic activity and just getting moving.  The LSM Diet recommends restaurant operators create a plan and schedule time to get out of their four walls and meet the community, get involved with schools and area non profits.  Getting out of the four walls and getting involved takes time and effort, and is a necessary part of the LSM Diet.   For all the time and effort spent, the operator will see the  return  on involvement in the form of guest loyalty, frequency and sales success.

The LSM Diet can be used by any restaurant or retail operator.  For every operator the LSM Diet is going to be different.  A store may be near schools and hospitals or maybe a location in a business park, how each of these operators gets involved with their local area are two different diets or LSM programs.  The LSM Diet can be implemented anytime. Whether you start in January or July, just start!  Just like a diet, by following the LSM Diet and working towards a goal of consistency, momentum as well as sales will be the reward.

Today if you are a restaurant operator waiting for guests to walk through the door and you think nothing has changed   you are wrong!  Everything has changed and unless you find your own inspiration to motivate yourself and your crew to focus on sale driving tactics, you will be left behind.   The true success will be by those operators that actually implement marketing tactics and in return will reap ROI = Return on INVOLVEMENT from their inspiration!  The tenth commandment is up to you!  You can do it!

Hwy 55 Burgers, Shakes & Fries is set to welcome guests at its new Lewisburg TN location at 712 North Ellington Parkway in Governor s Plaza. With Tennessee locations already in Nolensville and Spring Hill, the Lewisburg restaurant adds to the brand s statewide-profile, and approximately 50 new Hwy 55 locations are planned for Tennessee over the next 10 years.

 Lewisburg is a beautiful small town nestled in the rolling hills of Middle Tennessee. It s a place of backyards and front porches where industry meets the farmland. Community and culture are neighbors, and tradition and progress are friends,  said Cade Cothren, whose family is Hwy 55 s master franchisees for the state of Tennessee.  The people here are polite and helpful so we know Hwy 55 s family-friendly concept and dedication to authentic hospitality will fit right in. 

With 127 units and growing quickly, Hwy 55 boasts a fresh, All-American diner experience with fresh, never-frozen burgers, premium sliced cheesesteaks piled high on steamed hoagies, and frozen custard made in-house every day. With its open-grill design, the kitchen s dedication and care when hand-crafting meals is front and center.

Those principles continue today at all of our restaurants and I m excited that in our new Lewisburg location, this vibrant community has a rich family tradition which pairs perfectly with Hwy 55 s focus on retro values and always-fresh take on classics.

Andy s Charitable Foundation is Hwy 55 s most visible commitment to community involvement.

Hwy 55 has resonated with the burger-loving public, while the restaurant and franchising industries have taken notice of the growing concept as well.

For more than 13 years, Which Wich Superior Sandwiches has pushed the boundaries of the fast-casual sector with its customizable sandwiches and creative, trademark brown-bag ordering system. Now, as the national chain sets its sights on exponential franchise expansion, it will have the insight and leadership of an experienced franchise executive at its helm. On September 6, Ric Scicchitano will join Which Wich as president, helping to guide menu innovation, marketing and the strategic plan set forth by Which Wich s executive team.

 I truly believe that positive change produces positive results, and in getting to know Ric, I found a positive leader, perfectly positioned to pioneer our ongoing innovation,  said Jeff Sinelli, Which Wich Founder and Chief Vibe Officer.  I m thrilled to have him among our senior leadership team at Which Wich. 

Scicchitano brings with him an impressive restaurant pedigree. His career headlines include leadership positions with Corner Bakery Caf , where he served as one of the brand s first employees. After graduating from New York s Culinary Institute of America with a degree in culinary and baking, Scicchitano immediately went to work for Richard Melman, an innovative restaurateur that both Sinelli and Scicchitano share an admiration for. Scicchitano was part of the core team bringing Melman s newest concept, Corner Bakery, to life where he created updated menus. As the Corner Bakery brand evolved, so too did Scicchitano s role.

In 2002, Scicchitano was promoted to vice president of food and beverage, where his responsibilities included menu strategy and culinary development. In addition to creating and perfecting new menu items and ensuring current items were on trend and innovative, Scicchitano was also responsible for the purchasing of all food, beverage and packing needs. After 25 years with Corner Bakery, Scicchitano ended his tenure in the role of executive vice president, after helping to make the brand a household name.

Now, backed by more than two decades of experience, Scicchitano is poised to bring his unique expertise to his new role with Which Wich. Sharing a restaurant hospitality pedigree similar to Sinelli s, Scicchitano is eager to work alongside Which Wich s founder to continue its fresh, forward-thinking attitude.

 During my previous tenure, I went outside the box to implement ideas that make brands exciting and impactful, while working closely with marketing, supply chain and our development teams to implement impactful structural changes,  Scicchitano said.  I have a passion for great brands that serve great food. That s the core of the business we re in, and we accomplish it one guest at a time, one sandwich at a time. It s the perfect time to take that vision to Which Wich, an exciting and rapidly growing brand with so much potential ahead. My mission is to build on the swagger behind this innovative brand. 

Which Wich Superior Sandwiches was founded in Dallas in late 2003 by restaurant entrepreneur, Jeff Sinelli. The national sandwich franchise chain is best known for its customizable sandwiches, creative ordering system, and personalized sandwich bag. In 2014, QSR named Which Wich one of their  2014 Best Franchise Deals  and Forbes listed Which Wich as one of their 2014  30 Best Franchises To Buy.  Which Wich is also the recipient of the 2015 Nation s Restaurant News MenuMasters  Healthful Innovations  award. Which Wich currently has more than 400 locations open and an extensive pipeline of development in 39 states and 11 countries.

 AT RRT, we focus on providing our clients innovative and fully integrated solutions for restaurant operators to grow their off-premise business, which is the fastest growing segment within the industry and represents close to 40 percent of our industry s total market opportunity,  said David Schofield, CEO of RRT.

However, the majority of operators are extremely challenged in supporting these larger transactions as well as actively engaging in outbound business development. Often times the dine-in experience is their primary focus and the other opportunities, specifically as related to off-premise opportunities, are neglected. Operators need to understand that they are leaving a significant amount of money on the table.

To combat childhood hunger, Lennys Grill & Subs has once again teamed up with No Kid Hungry to provide as many as 300,000 meals to children in need. With a goal to raise $30,000, the home of delicious subs is encouraging just a $1 donation by its guests to No Kid Hungry from August 29th through October 2nd.



According to No Kid Hungry, one in five American children struggles with food insecurity, meaning they may not know where their next meal will come. But a $1 donation to the organization can help connect a child facing hunger with up to 10 meals*. Since 1984, Share Our Strength, which runs the No Kid Hungry campaign, has raised more than $528 million through corporate sponsorships, events and donations. During that timeframe, funds have been granted to more than 1,100 deserving organizations nationwide that help to feed hungry children.

 Everyone has a role in helping end childhood hunger in America,  said Diana Hovey, Senior Director, Dine Out for No Kid Hungry.   It s heartwarming to see the restaurant industry come together for our cause, and we are thrilled to have an iconic brand like Lennys Grill and Subs, who cares about giving back to their community, join us once again this year. 

This is the second year that Lennys has partnered with No Kid Hungry. With the help of the hard work from the brand s team members, Lennys exceeded its fundraising goal of $25,000 in 2015. Now, the brand is setting the bar even higher. If each of the brand s 105 restaurants can raise $10 per day over the course of 35 days, Lennys will meet its goal of $30,000.

 We recognize the needs of those in our communities who don t have enough nutritious food. No child should wonder if he or she will get a meal every day,  said Kevin Martin, president and CEO for Lennys.  We re proud to team up with No Kid Hungry and excited to create this opportunity for both our customers and franchisees to help those in need. 

As part of the campaign running until October 2nd, Lennys is encouraging patrons to donate $1 each time they visit. Diners  good deeds will be recognized with $2 off coupon for any club sandwich on their next visit.

Every year, thousands of restaurants across the country come together to raise money and awareness for No Kid Hungry, spurring millions of customers to donate to the charity at the point of sale in stores, online and social-media sites, or by participating in local fundraising and cause-marketing events.

Since the first Lenny s Subs opened in 1998 in Memphis, TN, the mission has been simple: to make and serve great food. Known for serving the  World Class Philly Cheesesteaks  and other high quality deli sandwiches and salads, Lennys Grill & Subs offers breads baked fresh daily, premium meats sliced to order and freshly prepared toppings. With more than 100 locations today, Lennys Grill & Subs continues to expand throughout the southeast by offering single and multi-restaurant franchise opportunities while selling the best-tasting all-American subs available. For franchise information, visit http://www.lennysfranchise.com.

No child should go hungry in America, but 1 in 5 kids will face hunger this year. Using proven, practical solutions, No Kid Hungry is ending childhood hunger today by ensuring that kids start the day with a nutritious breakfast and families learn the skills they need to shop and cook on a budget. When we all work together, we can make sure kids get the healthy food they need. No Kid Hungry is a campaign of national anti-hunger organization Share Our Strength. Join at NoKidHungry.org.



*This amount is based on the individual experiences of grant recipients. Contributions will be used to reach the highest number of children facing hunger in America. Share Our Strength is a non-profit 501(c)3 organization.","Restaurants and Food Services"

  Aug. 24    If you love your breakfast food saturated in sweet sticky syrup, you are not alone. Despite food industry trends favoring healthy, gluten free, and portable products, it s clear that Americas haven t entirely given their favorite battered breakfast foods the boot. 
 Recent research by Packaged Facts reveals that more than half of U.S. households (60%) use waffle/pancake mix. Likewise, just under half (48%) opt for frozen varieties of waffles, pancakes, and French toast.    
 Ten years ago, household use of pancake/waffle mix was as high as 64%. Reliance on these affordable mixes rose further during the recession. Inevitably, there has been a modest decline as the economy has recovered. This reflects the trend towards a return to home cooking and reduced price sensitivity generating movement toward premium package goods and dining out. In addition, Americans watching their diets are 7% less likely to use pancake/waffle mix due to gluten intolerance. 
 At the same time, use of frozen waffles/pancakes/French toast has remained steady, with a modest downturn noted for 2014-2015. Ultimately, these frozen breakfast options remain affordable therefore insulating the category against reactive recessionary spending triggers. Frozen breakfast waffles/pancakes/French toast also meet demand for convenience and for being a  quick, easy and painless  breakfast. Moreover, industry players are developing packaging formats to increase portability. Nevertheless, as is the case with mixes, the frozen category hasn t been completely immune to the gluten-free trend. Packaged Facts found that those watching their diet because of gluten intolerance are 15% less likely to use these frozen breakfast items. 
 Echoing an evolving consumer lifestyle trend, portability is shaping breakfast food usage growth beyond pancakes and waffles. Portable foods such as breakfast bars, breakfast sandwiches, supplements and energy bars drove usage uptake during 2006-2015. Traditional breakfast staples, such as eggs, bacon, and sausage are undergoing slight to moderate usage declines, in part because use does not fit as easily into consumer demands for quick and portable breakfast solutions. Cold cereal, another breakfast staple, has suffered from steeper declines: while cold cereal provides a quick, easy breakfast solution, it also suffers from lack of portability and may generally remain under pressure for high sugar content scrutiny not unlike what pancakes and waffles face. 
 Again this points back to what consumers want. Today s consumers seek simplicity on their approach to breakfast. They want no fuss, no drama, no confusion, and no time wasted. For many, breakfast choices involve removing pain points that could clog the flow of their day and weighing breakfast choices in terms of value for time. In each case, cost lurks in the background, since the breakfast someone normally has is not a splurge or a special occasion; it s part of the weekly budget for everyday spending. But simplicity drives choice.

"Meal kit delivery services are cooking","              Learn more about this burgeoning industry in Packaged Facts  report,   Meal Kit Delivery Service in the U.S.    
  Aug. 22 -  Meal kit delivery services have exploded since their introduction in 2012, bridging the space between home-cooked meals and takeout. Meant to solve the perennial problem of  what s for dinner?,  the services offer people a convenient way to cook at home without having to do the meal planning and grocery shopping. Online portals let consumers order meals ahead from picture menus showing beautiful photos of each finished dish, and the services deliver the pre-measured fresh ingredients along with recipes to their doorstep to help them cook chef-like meals at home. They are aiming for and finding a  sweet spot  with consumers who do not have the time, inclination, or know-how to shop for individual ingredients, find a recipe, and cook from scratch, yet do not want to eat yet another heat-and-eat prepared meal, order takeout food, or dine out. 
 Led by Blue Apron, HelloFresh, and Plated, more than 150 meal delivery kit services are now vying for this business in the United States, whether on a national, regional, or local basis. Over the past few years, meal kit delivery service startups have collectively raised more than more than $650 million in venture capital.  Most meal kit delivery services target young professionals and busy families with children, especially millennial urbanites. Freshness is a huge selling point: these services claim their ingredients are fresher than those consumers can buy in grocery stores. Other major selling points of many kits are that they teach consumers cooking skills, help broaden taste buds, and make exotic ingredients available everywhere. Marketers also play up meal kits as being something fun to do and bringing people together. Critics of meal kits say they are  like paint-by-numbers,  too expensive for most people, with an average cost of $10 to $15 per person per meal, and by far the most common criticism use too much packaging, much of which is environmentally unsound. 
 Meal kit delivery services have the potential to disrupt both the restaurant industry and the grocery industry because they allow people to cook restaurant-quality meals at home without going out to grocery shop. Rather than worrying whether meal kit delivery services will cut into their business, some grocers and food marketers are starting their own such services.

"What s in your (digital) wallet?","              This blog is based on the report  Mobile Payments in the U.S.  View the abstract and table of contents   here  .  
  Aug. 10 -  Take a peek at your wallet or purse and what do you see? A little cash? A driver s license? Employee ID and insurance cards? Some lint? And, of course, a nice mix of payment cards? 
 For a card issuer, it all comes down to where their card stands in your wallet: is it your primary card, the one that sits at the top of your wallet the one you grab the most when paying? For many issuers, that s the catbird seat. You don t have to be first to be a winner though, especially if you are a private label card issuer with hopes of driving sales to a specific merchant, where third place isn t just a ribbon to toss in a drawer; or even a cobrand card issuer, where second can feel downright wonderful. 
 Even if a wallet can hold seven or eight cards, some of them can become out of sight, out of mind, hidden beneath the insurance card, never to be used again. A sad day indeed for that card. Meanwhile, mini-wallets today hold just two or three cards giving users reason to bring along only those cards that make the first cut. 
 In theory, digital wallets promise a bigger wallet one that can hold all of your cards, including loyalty and gifts cards (the ones we otherwise so easily lose they never even get into that old-school leather wallet!). This is a boon for consumers, who now can actually manage and manage not to lose all of their cards using them when and where they see fit. And it means all cards get a place in the wallet, a boon for the has-beens and the forgotten. 
 But it doesn t change the battle for the top spots. And by introducing ACH debit into the mix, some digital wallets may actually give up a spot to what is essentially a check that card issuers and networks make no money on. In these cases, the war for wallet share intensifies. 
  Cause for concern  
 But despite having access to all of that virtual real estate, mobile POS payers may not be using it, according to Packaged Facts December 2015 survey results: 
  Some 48% of adult smartphone users who have used their phone to make a payment at the point of sale in the past 12 months say that they carry fewer cards than they used to carry a result of using mobile payments. 
  And the tendency to carry fewer cards to make payments is higher among Millennials, already a credit card usage trouble spot. 
   Cards are getting winnowed out . Not good, unless you re near the top of the wallet. 
 This finding opens up a world of follow-up questions, among them:  
  Instead of loading  all  of their cards, are mobile POS payers just loading the ones they really need? 
  Are they defaulting to the card originally uploaded as a part of a corresponding user account (in Apple Pay, for example, do they just use the card originally entered in iTunes)? 
 How do credit card rewards/points factor into using credit cards in digital wallets? 
 Could merchants tie rewards to ACH debit?

Aug. 10 - Take a peek at your wallet or purse and what do you see? A little cash? A driver s license? Employee ID and insurance cards? Some lint? And, of course, a nice mix of payment cards?

For a card issuer, it all comes down to where their card stands in your wallet: is it your primary card, the one that sits at the top of your wallet the one you grab the most when paying? For many issuers, that s the catbird seat. You don t have to be first to be a winner though, especially if you are a private label card issuer with hopes of driving sales to a specific merchant, where third place isn t just a ribbon to toss in a drawer; or even a cobrand card issuer, where second can feel downright wonderful.

Even if a wallet can hold seven or eight cards, some of them can become out of sight, out of mind, hidden beneath the insurance card, never to be used again. A sad day indeed for that card. Meanwhile, mini-wallets today hold just two or three cards giving users reason to bring along only those cards that make the first cut.

In theory, digital wallets promise a bigger wallet one that can hold all of your cards, including loyalty and gifts cards (the ones we otherwise so easily lose they never even get into that old-school leather wallet!). This is a boon for consumers, who now can actually manage and manage not to lose all of their cards using them when and where they see fit. And it means all cards get a place in the wallet, a boon for the has-beens and the forgotten.

But it doesn t change the battle for the top spots. And by introducing ACH debit into the mix, some digital wallets may actually give up a spot to what is essentially a check that card issuers and networks make no money on. In these cases, the war for wallet share intensifies.

But despite having access to all of that virtual real estate, mobile POS payers may not be using it, according to Packaged Facts December 2015 survey results:

Cards are getting winnowed out. Not good, unless you re near the top of the wallet.

This finding opens up a world of follow-up questions, among them:

"Growth in meat snack sales is not for all products","              Packaged Facts is offering a healthy discount on   Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition  . Purchase the report by October 1 and receive 10% off with code  SNACKS2016 .  
  Aug. 2 -  Meat snacks (jerky and other snacks such as meat sticks) have become a darling of the snacking world in the last couple of years. Between paleo dieters and CrossFitters espousing the benefits of a high protein diet, the gluten- and wheat-free tribes avoiding anything to do with breads, and the continued negative press that carbs have been receiving, meat has come galloping to the rescue for many different types of snackers. 
 However, this has also caused a shift in the style of meat snacks gaining popularity, which is away from traditional simple varieties of beef jerky and towards more complex meat snacks that make use of alternative proteins (i.e., bison, kangaroo, salmon) and unique flavors, marketing artisanal meat snacks that are worlds away from your grandfather s jerky, notes Packaged Facts in the report    Healthy-Ingredient Snacks in the U.S., 2nd Edition   . 
 So how is this shift affecting sales for different meat snack providers? Link Snacks is the largest meat snack producer in the U.S., but is also having the roughest go of it trying to stay relevant in this new snacking world. Dollar sales for the company over the past year were down 7% while volume sales were down 15%, which shows the company has tried to stave off larger losses by increasing prices. If any meat snack brand epitomizes the classic style of jerky, it is Jack Link s, and these sales results show that this is not the kind of jerky people are looking for any more. 
 Compare these results to Krave s, a brand that epitomizes the new wave of healthier-for-you meat snacks marketed directly towards Millennials and which feature unique ingredients. The company ranked among the top eight marketers of meat snacks over the past year in terms of dollar sales. Dollar sales for the company were up 71%, with volume sales up 84%. These results suggest the company is selling more of its 3.5 oz bags of jerky as well as the even larger bags it sells online, but anyway you slice it, growth of the brand has been phenomenal. Oberto Sausage has also seen really good growth in dollar sales through the introduction of its new All Natural Oberto Jerky brand. The lower unit sales growth and much lower volume sales growth suggests the company has positioned this jerky as a premium brand, with a higher price point compared to its Oh Boy! brand. 
 However, let s be clear; it is really only Link Snacks and private label meat snacks that are having a hard time growing sales in this fast-growing category. Other traditional meat snacks manufacturers are doing just fine. ConAgra Foods saw strong growth in sales of its classic Slim Jim meat sticks over the period, although it is clear that about half of that growth came through price increases. Bridgford Foods is also doing exceptionally well with its Sweet Baby Ray jerkies, which pair Bridgford Foods  jerkies with the well-known BBQ sauce brand. The company actually saw a 37% increase in unit sales over the period, higher than the dollar sales growth, but slightly lower volume sales growth, suggesting the company reduced unit sizes over the period. 
 Clearly, Link Snacks needs to get itself sorted in this new market, and the company s recent introduction of its Small Batch and Lorissa s Kitchen brands are a step in this direction. However, its doubtful Krave, Bridgford Foods, and the other marketers are going to calmly wait for the venerable jerky marketer to catch up.

 Taken together, these factors boil down to the notion that cats should not be eating from bowls. Plopping a scoop of food into a bowl is not enough!

"Expanding the reach of Asian noodles","              Save 10% on  Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities  using code PFNOODLES. Purchase the report  here .  
  July 18 -  Generally speaking, consumers express interest in new culinary experiences; however, some trepidation remains when it comes to actually  trying  different foods from other cultures. Through innovation, Asian noodle marketers can help bridge the gap between interest and trial, according to Packaged Facts in the report    Asian Noodles: U.S. Market Trends and Opportunities   . 
 As suggested by our survey results, those who eat Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. The willingness to explore new food options skews higher among those who eat Asian noodles at a restaurant. 
 Once again, this reinforces the idea that restaurants are often a point of entry in ethnic food exploration. So it s not surprising to find that Asian noodle users tend to strongly agree that they enjoy eating foreign foods at a restaurant and often try different foods from other cultures. 
 Some degree of food adventurousness is required to gain knowledge and experience, which can then prompt continued food exploration. 
  As suggested by our survey results, those who believe they possess a strong knowledge of Asian noodles are more likely subscribe to adventurous behaviors and attitudes when it comes to food and culture. This implies that the willingness to explore new food options and culinary experiences leads to increased confidence and knowledge in other cuisines. 
 Conversely, those who claim they have no Asian noodle knowledge are also less adventurous when it comes to trying new foods/recipes or showing interest in other cultures and foreign foods. 
  To better attract those who are less willing to experiment in food and culture, providing customized options allowing guests to select familiar ingredients will likely have the best opportunity as a point of entry for these new users.  
 Consider the expanding noodle chain Wagamama, which frames its brand as presenting staple modern Asian cuisine delivering fresh, authentic menus that are updated seasonally. The company leverages authenticity while understanding menu explanation is important to help guests feel comfortable with its brand and menu. For example, Teppanyaki is a menu section that offers this explanation to help patrons to increase noodle knowledge and encourage trial:  Teppanyaki is a big plate of sizzling noodles, stir-fried by quickly turning them on a flat griddle. This means you get soft noodles and crunchy vegetables.  
  The bottom line  
 By leveraging limited-time offers, seasonal menus, and other menu strategies that play to variety and change, restaurants play a significant role in shaping society s comfort with trying the new and different when it comes to foreign/ethnic foods. 
 For packaged food marketers, noodle opportunity involves utilizing brand extension, cobranding partnerships and premiumization to gain traction and encourage consumers to explore this type of culinary innovation at home.

"Millennials: Unbanked but bankable?","              Packaged Facts is your trusted source for market research on the financial services industry. We cover topics ranging from financial services for small businesses to debit &amp; credit cards to mobile payments. See our full catalog of related reports  here .   
  June 27 -  Survey analysis performed for Packaged Facts    Underbanked and Unbanked Consumers   report suggests a clear general trend away from having checking and savings accounts at traditional banking institutions even while consumers eschewing these accounts use banks for other products and services. This trend challenges the long-standing banking model that frames checking and savings accounts as the foundation for broader, deeper customer relationships. 
 Our research suggests that these  unbanked  consumers (those we define as having neither a checking nor a savings account) include those who have been underserved or shut out of traditional banking channels for financial reasons. 
 However, a different type of  unbanked  consumer emerges: one who chooses not to have a checking or savings account at a bank because that consumer has more options, not fewer options; and one who may not even view these types of accounts as relevant in the twenty-first century. 
   Many Millennials fit this description .   
 Survey analysis suggests a shift among Millennials toward account funding methods falling outside of traditional checking and savings accounts, in particularly emerging banking models. The trend clearly bodes ill for major banking institutions that do not adapt to the evolving needs of this group, which prize internet- and mobile-driven solutions, see  checking  as antiquated and irrelevant, and are likely savvy price shoppers, and are quite comfortable with online-only financial service models. 
 But we also find that younger unbanked have not forsaken traditional banking for financial services needs that fall outside of checking and savings accounts far from it: 
  In 2008, some 20% of unbanked 18-34s had nevertheless used a bank, a credit union or a savings &amp; loan institution in the past 12 months for some other kind of product or service. 
 In 2015, the percentage of unbanked 18-34s using these financial institutions for something else had risen to 37.5%.  
  These activities could range from obtaining major loans to picking up a prepaid card, getting a money order or cashing in coins. The bottom line is that the theory that Millennials are abandoning banks may be significantly overblown: By one measure, traditional financial institutions are clearly bleeding younger checking and savings accountholders, but by another much broader measure, usage is on the rebound. 
 The question is whether that usage translates to major-ticket revenue in the form of major loans or investment vehicles, steady, incremental revenue in the form of credit cards and prepaid cards, or some other source or merely an occasional piggyback on branch convenience for minor products or services.
